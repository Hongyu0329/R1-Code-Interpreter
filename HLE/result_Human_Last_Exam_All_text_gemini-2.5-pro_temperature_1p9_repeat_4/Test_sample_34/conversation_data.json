    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game. \"Rake-free\" is a key detail, as it makes opening marginal hands slightly more profitable, encouraging a wider range. \"100BB\" is the standard stack depth for which most opening ranges are designed.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last post-flop, which gives you a significant informational advantage. Because of this, you can profitably open-raise the widest range of hands from this position.\n    *   **Action:** Open to 2.5x. This is a standard raise size from late position.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find the \"worst suited jack\" (JXs) that is still considered a profitable open-raise in this situation. The \"worst\" hand will be the one with the lowest expected value (EV) that is still positive.\n\n2.  **List and Evaluate the Candidate Hands:**\n    The possible suited jack hands, in descending order of strength, are: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. We need to analyze why one is better than another.\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Factors for Hand Strength:**\n    *   **High Card Strength:** The Jack is a reasonably strong high card. The second card, or \"kicker,\" also contributes. A higher kicker is better.\n    *   **Connectivity:** This refers to how close the two cards are in rank. Closer cards (e.g., JTs) have a much higher probability of making straights than cards with large gaps (e.g., J2s). Suited connectors (like JTs) are premium hands. Suited gappers (like J9s or J8s) are also strong. As the gap widens, the straight potential drops significantly.\n    *   **Suitedness:** All candidate hands are suited, meaning they can all make flushes. A Jack-high flush is strong. The kicker has minimal impact on the strength of the flush itself, but this is the primary source of value for the weakest hands in this group.\n\n4.  **Rank the Hands Based on these Factors:**\n    *   **JTs:** This is the best hand in the group. It is a \"suited connector\" with excellent straight potential (it can make the best possible straight, Broadway) and flush potential. This is a premium hand and a mandatory open from any position.\n    *   **J9s, J8s:** These are strong \"suited gappers.\" They still have good playability, making both straights and flushes. They are clear opens from the button.\n    *   **J7s down to J2s:** As the kicker gets lower, the hand's value decreases significantly. The primary reason for this decrease is the loss of connectivity. The chance of making a straight with J5s or J2s is drastically lower than with J9s. For these lower hands, their value comes almost exclusively from their flush-making potential and occasionally pairing the Jack.\n\n5.  **Consult a Standard Button Opening Range:**\n    In a standard 100BB cash game, a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) or near-GTO strategy for the button involves opening a very wide range, often between 45% and 50% of all possible hands. In a rake-free environment, this range is even slightly wider. These standard opening ranges almost universally include *all suited Jack combinations*.\n    *   JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, and J5s are always considered standard opens.\n    *   J4s, J3s, and J2s are at the absolute bottom of the playable suited jacks. They have the least connectivity and the lowest kickers. While their expected value is low, it is still considered positive in this scenario due to the massive positional advantage of the button.\n\n6.  **Conclusion: Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:**\n    Since a standard strategy advises opening all suited Jacks from JTs down to J2s, the \"worst\" one that you *should* open is the one with the lowest intrinsic strength and profitability. By comparing the weakest hands in the group:\n    *   J4s is better than J3s.\n    *   J3s is better than J2s.\n    The reason **J2s** is the worst is because it has the largest possible gap between the Jack and the kicker, giving it the absolute worst straight potential of the group. Its value is almost entirely dependent on hitting a flush draw or pairing the Jack (with the worst possible kicker). Therefore, it is the most marginal, lowest EV open among all suited Jacks.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
