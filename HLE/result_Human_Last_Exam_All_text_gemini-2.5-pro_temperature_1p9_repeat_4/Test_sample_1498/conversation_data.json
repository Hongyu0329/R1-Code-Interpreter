    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Poem**\nThe poem in question is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (عقيدة العوام), which translates to \"The Creed of the Laymen.\" It was authored by Imam Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi al-Maliki. It is a foundational text, often memorized by children and beginners, that outlines the essential beliefs (Aqeedah) of the Ash'ari school of Sunni Islam in a simple, rhyming format. The poem covers the tenets of faith, including the belief in Allah, His attributes, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers (Prophets), the Last Day, and Divine Decree (Qadar).\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Section on Prophets**\nWithin the poem, there is a dedicated section on the belief in the Messengers of Allah (الرسل, ar-Rusul). This section first discusses the attributes that are necessary, impossible, and permissible for them. Following this general discussion, the author explicitly lists the 25 prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an and whom it is obligatory for a Muslim to know by name.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Starting Bayt (Verse) of the List**\nThe enumeration of the prophets' names does not begin immediately. It is preceded by an introductory verse that establishes the obligation of knowing these 25 names. This verse is:\n\n> **وَتَفْصِيلُ خَمْسٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ - كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ**\n> (Wa tafṣīlu khamsin wa `ishrīna lazim - Kulla mukallafin fa-ḥaqqiq waghtanim)\n> \"And the details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding - Upon every responsible person, so ascertain [this] and take advantage.\"\n\nAccording to the most common numbering, this is the **35th Bayt**. While this verse *introduces* the list, the question asks from which verse the *names are mentioned*. The actual listing of names begins in the very next verse.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Verses Containing the Names**\nFollowing the introductory verse, the names of the 25 prophets are listed over the next four couplets.\n\n*   **Bayt 36:** This verse begins the list with Adam.\n    > **هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُهُمْ - مَعْ صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ**\n    > (Hum Ādamun, Idrīsu, Nūḥun, Hūduhum - Ma` Ṣāliḥin wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttaba`)\n    > They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\n\n*   **Bayt 37:** This verse continues the list.\n    > **لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا - يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى**\n    > (Lūṭun wa Ismā`īlu, Isḥāqu kadhā - Ya`qūbu, Yūsufu wa Ayyūbu-ḥtadhā)\n    > Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed their path.\n\n*   **Bayt 38:** The list continues.\n    > **شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ - ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ**\n    > (Shu`aybu, Hārūnu wa Mūsā wal-Yasa` - Dhul-Kifli, Dāwūdu, Sulaymānu-ttaba`)\n    > Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa and al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\n\n*   **Bayt 39:** This is the final verse of the list, concluding with Prophet Muhammad.\n    > **إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى - عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا**\n    > (Ilyāsu, Yūnusu, Zakariyyā, Yaḥyā - `Īsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun da`-ghayyā)\n    > Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the seal, leave misguidance.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Range**\nThe actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins at **Bayt 36** and concludes at **Bayt 39**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** The numbering of verses (*abyāt*) can vary slightly between different printed editions or manuscripts of the poem. However, the sequence and content of the verses remain consistent. The range 36-39 is the standard and most widely recognized numbering.\n2.  **Introductory Verse vs. The List Itself:** It is important to distinguish between the verse that mandates knowing the names (Bayt 35) and the verses that actually contain the names (Bayt 36-39). The question specifically asks where the \"names... are mentioned,\" making 36-39 the most precise answer.\n3.  **Name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** In the final verse of the list (Bayt 39), Prophet Muhammad is referred to poetically as **Tāhā (طه)** and as the **Khātim (خاتم)**, meaning the \"Seal of the Prophets.\"\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the section of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that explicitly lists the names of the 25 prophets starts from the 36th Bayt and ends at the 39th Bayt.\n\n<<<From Bayt 36 to Bayt 39>>>"
