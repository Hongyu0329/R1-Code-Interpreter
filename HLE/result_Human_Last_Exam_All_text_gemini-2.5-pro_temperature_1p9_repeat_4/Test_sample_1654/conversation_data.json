    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the total number of times Anton Chekhov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, specifically focusing on the actions of him wearing, taking off, or putting on the coat, as these actions symbolize his changing mentality.\n\n2.  **Identify the Symbolism:** The prompt correctly states that the coat is a key symbol in the story. Otchumyelov's physical comfort (feeling hot or cold) is a direct metaphor for his psychological state.\n    *   **Taking the coat off:** Represents him feeling powerful, authoritative, and literally \"hot under the collar\" when dealing with someone he perceives as low-status.\n    *   **Putting the coat on:** Represents him feeling a \"chill\" of fear or a need to appear more formal and deferential when confronted with the possibility that a person of high status is involved.\n\n3.  **Chronological Breakdown of the Story's Events:** We need to trace the story's plot and count each distinct action related to the coat.\n\n    *   **First Description:** At the beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks across the market square, he is described as wearing a **\"new overcoat\"**. This establishes his character and official status. This is count #1.\n\n    *   **Second Description:** After hearing the initial complaint from the goldsmith Hryukin, Otchumyelov assumes the dog's owner is unimportant and decides to take a hard line. He feels authoritative and hot. He says to the policeman, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" **He takes his coat off.** This is count #2.\n\n    *   **Third Description:** Someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov is immediately fearful of offending a powerful figure. Chekhov writes that Otchumyelov \"feels a chill.\" He tells the policeman, \"Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I am cold.\" **He puts his coat back on.** This is count #3.\n\n    *   **Fourth Description:** The policeman remarks that the General's dogs are all pointers, not like this one. Believing the owner is once again unimportant, Otchumyelov's authority returns. He exclaims that the dog is a stray and must be destroyed. He gets heated again, saying, \"It's hot...\" and orders the policeman, \"Take off my coat...\" **He takes his coat off again.** This is count #4.\n\n    *   **Fifth Description:** Another person in the crowd clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's *brother*, who has recently arrived. Faced again with a connection to power, Otchumyelov's entire demeanor changes to one of fawning sweetness. He feels the \"chill\" of deference once more. He says to Yeldyrin, \"Just help me on with my overcoat, brother...\" **He puts his coat back on for the second time.** This is count #5.\n\n    *   **Sixth Description:** The General's cook confirms the dog belongs to the General's brother. Now certain of where his loyalty must lie, Otchumyelov concludes the incident by fawning over the dog and threatening the victim, Hryukin. As he leaves the scene, Chekhov provides the final image: **\"...Otchumyelov, wrapping himself in his great-coat, goes on his way across the market-square.\"** This final act of wrapping the coat around himself solidifies his servile position. This is count #6.\n\n4.  **Final Tally:** By tracking each distinct action—the initial wearing, taking it off, putting it on, taking it off again, putting it on again, and finally wrapping it around himself—we arrive at a total of six descriptions.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat or the actions involving it a total of six times to symbolize his shifting mentality.\n\n<<<6>>>"
