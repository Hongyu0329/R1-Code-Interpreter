    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Setup**: The question concerns the relationship between geometric properties of lattices associated with squarefree natural numbers $N$.\n    *   **Squarefree Natural Number ($N$)**: This implies we are working with the real quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   **Lattice**: The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of this field can be embedded into the 2-dimensional real space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ via the Minkowski embedding: $\\sigma: \\alpha \\mapsto (\\sigma_1(\\alpha), \\sigma_2(\\alpha))$, where $\\sigma_1$ is the identity and $\\sigma_2$ is the Galois conjugate map ($a+b\\sqrt{N} \\mapsto a-b\\sqrt{N}$). The image $\\Lambda = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ forms a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   **Covolume ($V$)**: The covolume of this lattice $\\Lambda$, which is the volume of its fundamental domain, is given by $V = \\sqrt{|d_K|}$, where $d_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$.\n    *   **Norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)**: This notation is non-standard. In the context of lattice theory, \"norm\" usually refers to the length of vectors. The subscript '$\\infty$' indicates the infinity norm (or maximum norm): for a vector $x=(x_1, x_2)$, $\\|x\\|_\\infty = \\max(|x_1|, |x_2|)$. The term \"maximum norm\" is ambiguous. It cannot mean the norm of the longest vector in the lattice (as there is no such thing). A plausible interpretation, fitting the context of finding fundamental properties of a lattice, is one of the successive minima. Given we are in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, there are two successive minima, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. \"Maximum norm\" likely refers to the second successive minimum, $\\lambda_{2, \\infty}$, as it represents the size required to capture a full basis for the lattice. We interpret $k_{k,\\infty}$ as $\\lambda_{2, \\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Key Properties of the Lattice**:\n    *   **Minkowski's Second Theorem**: For any lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with covolume $V$, its successive minima with respect to the infinity norm satisfy the inequality:\n        $$ \\lambda_{1,\\infty} \\cdot \\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le V $$\n    *   **Arithmetic Property**: A crucial feature of these specific lattices arising from number fields is that for any non-zero element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, its algebraic norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ is a non-zero integer. For the corresponding lattice vector $x = \\sigma(\\alpha) = (x_1, x_2)$, this means the product of its components $x_1 x_2 = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ is a non-zero integer. Therefore, for any non-zero $x \\in \\Lambda$, we have $|x_1 x_2| \\ge 1$.\n\n3.  **Derive the Bound**: We can use the two properties above to find the bound.\n    *   **Lower Bound on the First Minimum ($\\lambda_{1,\\infty}$)**: Let $u = (u_1, u_2)$ be a lattice vector with the smallest non-zero infinity norm, meaning $\\|u\\|_\\infty = \\lambda_{1,\\infty}$. Using the arithmetic property:\n        $$ 1 \\le |u_1 u_2| = |u_1| \\cdot |u_2| $$\n        By the definition of the infinity norm, $|u_1| \\le \\|u\\|_\\infty$ and $|u_2| \\le \\|u\\|_\\infty$. Thus:\n        $$ 1 \\le \\|u\\|_\\infty \\cdot \\|u\\|_\\infty = \\|u\\|_\\infty^2 = \\lambda_{1,\\infty}^2 $$\n        Taking the square root gives us a lower bound for the first successive minimum:\n        $$ \\lambda_{1,\\infty} \\ge 1 $$\n    *   **Upper Bound on the Second Minimum ($\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$)**: We now combine this result with Minkowski's Second Theorem. We rearrange the theorem's inequality to solve for $\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$:\n        $$ \\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le \\frac{V}{\\lambda_{1,\\infty}} $$\n        Since we have established that $\\lambda_{1,\\infty} \\ge 1$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1,\\infty}} \\le 1$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n        $$ \\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le V \\cdot 1 = V $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe upper bound for the second successive minimum $\\lambda_{2, \\infty}$, which is our interpretation of the \"maximum norm\" $k_{k,\\infty}$, is the covolume $V$ of the lattice. This result holds specifically because the arithmetic structure of the underlying number field ensures that the lattice cannot be arbitrarily \"skewed\" or \"anisotropic.\"\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The interpretation of \"$k_{k,\\infty}$\" as the second successive minimum $\\lambda_{2, \\infty}$ is crucial. It is the most standard interpretation that makes the question well-posed and solvable.\n*   The result depends critically on the fact that the lattice arises from the ring of integers of a real quadratic field. For a general lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, no such upper bound exists relating $\\lambda_{2, \\infty}$ to the covolume alone.\n*   The property $|x_1 x_2| \\ge 1$ for any non-zero lattice vector is the key link between the arithmetic of the number field and the geometry of the lattice.\n\nFinal Answer: The upper bound is the covolume $V$.\n\n<<<V>>>"
