    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Source Text:** The *Iliad*.\n*   **Object:** A historical mountain (a real, physical geographic feature).\n*   **Exclusion:** Mount Olympus must not be the answer.\n*   **Criteria:** The mountain must be the \"tallest\" (highest in elevation) among all others mentioned in the epic that fit the criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nFirst, we must compile a list of all named mountains that appear in the text of the *Iliad*.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, central to the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece. (Elevation: 2,918 m / 9,573 ft). This is our baseline, but it is explicitly excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Ida (near Troy):** A very prominent mountain in the epic, located near the city of Troy in modern-day Turkey. Zeus frequently observes the Trojan War from its peaks (Gargarus and Lectum). Its modern name is Kaz Dağı.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Saos/Fengari):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the island of Samothrace to watch the battle.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, Greece. It is mentioned as the source of the ash wood used for Achilles' spear.\n*   **Mount Ossa:** Also in Thessaly, near Pelion and Olympus. It is mentioned in Book 2 of the *Iliad* in the Catalogue of Ships, which notes that the tribes of Polypoetes and Leonteus lived \"by the foot of Ossa\".\n*   **Mount Athos:** A mountain on a peninsula in northeastern Greece. In Book 14, Hera's journey from Olympus to Lemnos takes her over the peak of Athos.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** A mountain in Lydia (modern-day Turkey). In the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2), it is named as the homeland of the Maeonian allies of Troy.\n\n**Step 3: Verify and Gather Elevation Data**\nNow we must confirm these are all historical mountains and find their modern elevations to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m (9,573 ft) - *Excluded from the final answer*\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ, Turkey):** 2,157 m (7,077 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** 2,033 m (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ossa (Kissavos, Greece):** 1,978 m (6,490 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** 1,774 m (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion (Pilio, Greece):** 1,624 m (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Saos/Fengari, Greece):** 1,611 m (5,285 ft)\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Select the Tallest**\nWith the list of mountains and their elevations, we can now rank them to find the tallest after Olympus.\n\n1.  Mount Tmolus - 2,157 m\n2.  Mount Athos - 2,033 m\n3.  Mount Ossa - 1,978 m\n4.  Mount Ida - 1,774 m\n5.  Mount Pelion - 1,624 m\n6.  Mount Samothrace - 1,611 m\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter the excluded Mount Olympus, the historical mountain with the highest elevation mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Tmolus**. It is mentioned in Book 2 as the home of the Maeonians who fought for Troy, and its elevation of 2,157 meters is greater than that of Athos, Ossa, Ida, and the other candidates.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
