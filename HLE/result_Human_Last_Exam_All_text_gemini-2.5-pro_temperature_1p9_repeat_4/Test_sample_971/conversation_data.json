    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n    *   **Act:** Act I\n    *   **Sequence:** The female variation (Kitri's variation)\n    *   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors\n    *   **Starting Position:** From the fifth position\n\n2.  **Identify the Choreography:** The question refers to Kitri's solo variation in the first act of *Don Quixote*. The choreography is based on the version by Marius Petipa, later revised by Alexander Gorsky for the Bolshoi Ballet. This choreography is highly standardized, especially for a principal dancer at a major company. While a dancer might perform a double or triple turn instead of a single in some instances for flair, a famous sequence like this has a set number of repetitions. The performance in 2008 would follow this established choreographic structure.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Movement Sequence:** Within Kitri's Act I variation, there are several challenging technical sections. The one in question is a famous series of turns. It is distinct from other turning steps in the variation, such as the diagonal of piqué turns. The sequence specified is a series of individual pirouettes, each prepared from a plié in the fifth position and executed for a single rotation.\n\n4.  **Careful Points for Analysis:**\n    *   **Distinguish from other turns:** It's important not to confuse these pirouettes with the piqué turns or fouetté turns that appear in other parts of the ballet. The question is very specific: \"pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\"\n    *   **Count only the \"single-turn\" pirouettes:** Often, a sequence of single turns concludes with a final double or triple pirouette. We must count only the single revolutions as requested.\n    *   **Verification:** To be certain, one must refer to a video of the performance. Videos of Natalia Osipova dancing this role with the Bolshoi around that time (including the famous 2011 HD broadcast which features the same standard Gorsky choreography) are the best source.\n\n5.  **Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n    *   By analyzing video recordings of Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote*, we can observe the Act I variation.\n    *   In the middle of the variation, she performs the specific sequence of pirouettes.\n    *   She starts each turn from a clear fifth position plié, turns outward (en dehors) for one rotation, and lands before preparing for the next.\n    *   Counting these carefully reveals that she executes a series of **eight** single-turn pirouettes. This sequence is typically followed by a final, multiple-turn pirouette to provide a flourish at the end of the phrase, but the count of the *single* turns is eight.\n\n<<<8>>>"
