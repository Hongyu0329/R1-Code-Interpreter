    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Constraints**\n\n*   **Goal:** Count the number of unique, well-formed boolean expressions that evaluate to `True`.\n*   **Symbols:** `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Precedence:** `!` (highest) > `&` > `|` (lowest).\n*   **Associativity:** For operators of the same precedence (e.g., `T&F&T`), we assume standard left-to-right associativity: `(T&F)&T`.\n*   **Well-formed:** An expression must be syntactically valid according to the rules of boolean logic and operator precedence.\n\n**2. Strategy: Categorize by Syntactic Structure**\n\nWe can find all possible expressions by categorizing them based on their outermost syntactic structure. This ensures we count every unique written expression without double-counting. An expression of length 5 can have one of four main structures:\n\n1.  Parenthesized expression: `(A)`\n2.  Binary operation: `A op B`\n3.  Unary negation: `!A`\n\nWe will analyze each category to find the number of true expressions.\n\n### **Category 1: Expressions of the form `(A)`**\n\nFor `(A)` to have a length of 5, the inner expression `A` must have a length of 3. For the whole expression to be true, `A` must also evaluate to true.\n\n*   **Find all True expressions of length 3 (`A`)**:\n    *   **Form `X op Y`** (X, Y are literals `T` or `F`):\n        *   `T&T` (True)\n        *   `T|T` (True)\n        *   `T|F` (True)\n        *   `F|T` (True)\n    *   **Form `!!X`** (double negation):\n        *   `!!T` (True) -> same as `!(!T)`\n    *   **Form `(X)`**:\n        *   `(T)` (True)\n\n*   **Count:** There are 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 true expressions of length 3.\n*   **Conclusion for Category 1:** Placing parentheses around these 6 expressions gives 6 true expressions of length 5:\n    `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`\n*   **Total for Category 1: 6**\n\n### **Category 2: Expressions of the form `A op B`**\n\nFor `A op B` to have a length of 5, the combined length of the operands plus the operator must be 5 (i.e., `len(A) + len(B) + 1 = 5`). The operands A and B must themselves be well-formed expressions. We group these by the type of operands.\n\n*   **Sub-Category 2.1: Chained literals (`X op Y op Z`)**\n    *   This covers expressions like `T&T&F` where `X, Y, Z` are `T` or `F`. Assuming left-associativity, this is parsed as `(X op Y) op Z`. The total length is `1+1+1+1+1=5`.\n    *   Let's count the true combinations:\n        *   `A & B & C`: Only `T&T&T` is true. (1)\n        *   `A & B | C`: True if `C=T` (4 cases), or if `A=T, B=T, C=F` (1 case). Total 5.\n        *   `A | B & C`: True if `A|B=T` and `C=T`. `A|B` is true in 3 cases. Total 3.\n        *   `A | B | C`: True unless all are `F`. (7 cases)\n    *   **Total for Sub-Category 2.1: 1 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 16**\n\n*   **Sub-Category 2.2: Operands involving `( )` or `!`**\n    *   `len(A) + len(B) = 4`. Possible length pairs for (A, B) are (1,3), (3,1), and (2,2). The `(X op Y)` part of the chain from 2.1 is an example of a length 3 operand.\n    *   **Pair (3,1) and (1,3): Operand is `(Lit)` or `!!Lit`**\n        *   `(Lit) op Lit`: e.g., `(T)&T`. There are 4 true combinations: `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`.\n        *   `Lit op (Lit)`: e.g., `T&(T)`. Symmetric, gives 4 true combinations.\n        *   `!!Lit op Lit`: e.g., `!!T&T`. Gives 4 true combinations: `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`.\n        *   `Lit op !!Lit`: Symmetric, gives 4 true combinations.\n    *   **Pair (2,2): Operands are `!Lit`**\n        *   `!Lit op !Lit`: e.g., `!F&!F`. Gives 4 true combinations: `!F&!F`, `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F`.\n    *   **Total for Sub-Category 2.2: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20**\n\n### **Category 3: Expressions of the form `!A`**\n\nFor `!A` to have length 5, expression `A` must have length 4. For `!A` to be true, `A` must be false. Additionally, `!A` must be a valid expression of length 5, which means parentheses are not required around `A`. This restricts the structure of `A`. The operand `A` cannot be a bare binary operation (`X op Y`), as that would require parentheses (`!(X op Y)`) and result in a length greater than 5.\n\n*   **Find False expressions of length 4 (`A`) that fit the `!A` structure:**\n    *   **`A` is `(X)` where `X` has length 2 and is False:**\n        *   False length-2 expression: `!T`.\n        *   `A = (!T)`. This is a false expression of length 4.\n        *   `!A = !((!T))`. Length 5, True. (1)\n    *   **`A` is `((X))` where `X` has length 1 and is False:**\n        *   False length-1 expression: `F`.\n        *   `A = ((F))`. This is a false expression of length 4.\n        *   `!A = !((F))`. Length 5, True. (1)\n    *   **`A` is `!(X)` where `X` has length 2 and is True:**\n        *   True length-2 expression: `!F`. `A` is `!(!F)` -> `!!F`. This expression `!!F` is len 3 not 4. Let's adjust.\n    *   **Re-evaluating form `!A` more carefully:** The full expression starts with `!`. Let's count consecutive `!`s.\n        *   `!!(X)`: `!!(T)` evaluates to True and is `!`, `!`, `(`, `T`, `)`. Length 5. `!!(F)` is false. (1)\n        *   `!!!!X`: `!!!!T` evaluates to True and is 5 symbols. `!!!!F` is false. (1)\n\n*   Let's re-verify the full list from Category 3:\n    1.  `!((!T))` (`A` is `(!T)`, false, length 4)\n    2.  `!((F))` (`A` is `((F))`, false, length 4)\n    3.  `!!(T)` (This can be read as `!(!(T))`. `!(T)` is false and has length 4)\n    4.  `!!!!T` (This can be read as `!(!!!T)`. `!!!T` is false and has length 4)\n*   **Total for Category 3: 4**\n\n**4. Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each mutually exclusive category:\n\n*   Category 1: `(A)` -> 6\n*   Category 2: `A op B` -> 16 (chained) + 20 (structured operands) = 36\n*   Category 3: `!A` -> 4\n\n**Wait, let me reorganize my categories to be perfectly distinct based on the written form:**\n\n*   **Form 1: `(A)`** where A is len 3, True. **Count = 6**.\n*   **Form 2: `X op Y op Z`** where X,Y,Z are T/F literals. **Count = 16**.\n*   **Form 3: `A op B`** where at least one operand is not a single literal but the expression is not a simple chain.\n    *   `(Lit) op Lit` and `Lit op (Lit)` -> 4 + 4 = 8\n    *   `!!Lit op Lit` and `Lit op !!Lit` -> 4 + 4 = 8\n    *   `!Lit op !Lit` -> 4\n    *   Total for this Form: 8 + 8 + 4 = **20**.\n*   **Form 4: `!A...`** (expressions starting with negation).\n    *   `!((!T))`, `!((F))`, `!!(T)`, `!!!!T`.\n    *   **Count = 4**.\n\nTotal = 6 + 16 + 20 + 4 = **46**.\n\nThis categorization is non-overlapping and exhaustive.\n\nFinal Count:\n*   Category 1 (`(A)`): 6\n*   Category 2 (`X op Y op Z`): 16\n*   Category 3 (Other `A op B`): 20\n*   Category 4 (`!A...`): 4\n\n**Total = 6 + 16 + 20 + 4 = 46.**\n\n<<<46>>>"
