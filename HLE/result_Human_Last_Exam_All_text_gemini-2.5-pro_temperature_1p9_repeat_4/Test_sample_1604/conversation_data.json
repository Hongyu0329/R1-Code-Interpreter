    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the most recent historical event (a battle or military engagement) that Lady Butler depicted in any of her paintings. This requires differentiating between the date the painting was made and the date of the historical event it portrays.\n\n**Step 2: List Notable Paintings by Lady Butler and their Depicted Events**\nWe will list some of her most famous works and identify the battle and its date for each one.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** **(painted 1875):**\n    *   **Battle:** Battle of Quatre Bras, part of the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** June 16, 1815.\n\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** **(painted 1881):**\n    *   **Battle:** Battle of Waterloo, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Specifically, the charge of the Royal Scots Greys.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** June 18, 1815.\n\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** **(painted 1879):**\n    *   **Event:** The arrival of Assistant Surgeon William Brydon at Jalalabad, the sole European survivor of the 1842 retreat from Kabul.\n    *   **Historical Context:** First Anglo-Afghan War.\n    *   **Date of Event:** January 13, 1842.\n\n*   ***The Roll Call*** **(painted 1874):**\n    *   **Battle:** Aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman, part of the Crimean War.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** November 5, 1854.\n\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** **(painted 1880):**\n    *   **Battle:** Battle of Rorke's Drift, part of the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** January 22â€“23, 1879.\n\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** **(painted 1882):**\n    *   **Battle:** Battle of Laing's Nek, part of the First Boer War.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** January 28, 1881.\n\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** **(painted 1885):**\n    *   **Event:** The march of the Gordon Relief Expedition across the Bayuda Desert.\n    *   **Historical Context:** The Mahdist War in Sudan.\n    *   **Date of Event:** January 1885.\n\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** **(painted 1927):**\n    *   **Event:** The Great Retreat from Mons at the start of World War I.\n    *   **Date of Event:** August 1914.\n\n*   ***The Gates of Dawn*** **(painted c. 1924):**\n    *   **Event:** A British tank advance at dawn during World War I. The Mark V tanks shown were used in the later stages of the war.\n    *   **Historical Context:** The Hundred Days Offensive, which began with the Battle of Amiens.\n    *   **Date of Event:** August 1918.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Historical Events**\nLet's order the events by their historical date to find the latest one:\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras (1815)\n2.  Battle of Waterloo (1815)\n3.  Retreat from Kabul (1842)\n4.  Battle of Inkerman (1854)\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879)\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek (1881)\n7.  The Camel Corps' March (1885)\n8.  Retreat from Mons (1914)\n9.  Tank Advance at Amiens/Hundred Days Offensive (1918)\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy comparing the dates of the battles and military events depicted, the tank advance from the Hundred Days Offensive in **August 1918** is the latest historical event. This scene is portrayed in Lady Butler's painting, *The Gates of Dawn*.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary pitfall is to confuse the date a painting was created with the date of the event it depicts. For example, *In the Retreat from Mons* was painted in 1927, making it one of her later works, but the event itself (1914) is earlier than the one in *The Gates of Dawn* (1918).\n*   It is crucial to identify the specific campaign or battle. A title like *The Camel Corps* is less specific than a battle name, but research confirms it depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition of 1885.\n*   Lady Butler lived through World War I and depicted scenes from it, which are historically the latest military events she painted.\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is a scene from the Hundred Days Offensive of World War I (August 1918), shown in her painting *The Gates of Dawn*. This engagement is more recent than any of her famous Victorian-era battle scenes.\n\n<<<The tank advance during the Hundred Days Offensive (August 1918), as depicted in the painting \"The Gates of Dawn\"."
