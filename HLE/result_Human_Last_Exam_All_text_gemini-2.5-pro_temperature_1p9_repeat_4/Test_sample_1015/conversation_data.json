    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement:** A `cambré derrière` is a fundamental ballet movement where the dancer bends their upper body backward from the waist. It requires significant back flexibility, core strength, and control.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method Approach:**\n    *   **Foundation:** The Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, emphasizes clean lines, core strength, and precise, methodical execution.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** In a Vaganova cambré, the movement initiates from the upper thoracic spine (the upper back). The dancer lifts the chest towards the ceiling and arches backward.\n    *   **Careful Point - Hip Placement:** The most critical rule in a Vaganova cambré derrière is to keep the hips stable and directly over the supporting legs. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault as it breaks the correct alignment, relies on hip flexibility rather than back flexibility, and can strain the lower back. The pelvis remains neutral or slightly tucked.\n    *   **Careful Point - Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back. The arms, typically in 5th position en haut (high fifth), frame the head, maintaining a harmonious line.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method Approach:**\n    *   **Foundation:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine, prioritizes speed, musicality, and creating dynamic, elongated lines. The aesthetic often pushes movements to their extremes.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** The Balanchine style also involves a backward bend, but the mechanics are different to achieve a deeper and more visually dramatic arc.\n    *   **Careful Point - Hip Placement:** This is the key point of divergence. In the Balanchine method, the dancer is taught to press the hips forward as they bend backward. This forward displacement of the hips allows for a much deeper and more expansive backbend. It creates a powerful C-curve with the body.\n    *   **Careful Point - Overall Aesthetic:** This hip-forward position is not considered a fault but rather a stylistic choice essential to the Balanchine aesthetic. It contributes to the look of risk and \"off-balance\" dynamism that characterizes much of his choreography.\n\n### Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be subtle stylistic differences in the port de bras (carriage of the arms), the fundamental arm position (e.g., high fifth) is often similar. This is not the primary distinguishing factor.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova requires hips to be held stable over the feet. Balanchine encourages the hips to push forward. This directly addresses the fundamental mechanical difference between the two styles for this step.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is often associated with speed, a cambré is an adagio (slow) movement in both techniques. Speed is not the defining difference in its execution.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used. The Balanchine method allows for a deeper backbend *because* of the hip placement. Therefore, hip placement is the cause, while the degree of the bend is the effect. Option B is a more fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement is also a result of the overall bend. While the head might drop back further in a Balanchine cambré to complement the deeper arch, its placement is dictated by the spine and hip action, not an independent variable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the placement of the hips. The Vaganova method emphasizes stability by keeping the hips aligned over the feet, while the Balanchine method encourages pressing the hips forward to create a deeper, more dramatic curve.\n\n<<<B>>>"
