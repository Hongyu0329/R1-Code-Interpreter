    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ over the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the curve and its reduction modulo 2**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, since it is given by $y^2=f(x)$ where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $5=2g+1$.\nThe equation is $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nWe are interested in its stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nFirst, we reduce the equation modulo 2. The coefficients become:\n$8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$\nThe reduced equation over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n$y^2 = 0 \\cdot x^5 + 0 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 1 \\cdot x^2 + 0 \\cdot x$\n$y^2 = x^2$\nThis simplifies to $(y-x)^2 = 0$. The special fiber of the naive model is a non-reduced scheme, specifically a \"double line\". This indicates that the curve has bad, non-semistable reduction at $p=2$. The stable reduction will be a different curve, obtained after a minimal sequence of blow-ups and possibly a base extension.\n\n**Step 2: Find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of f(x)**\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the differences of the branch points of the curve. The branch points are the roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity.\nLet's find the valuations of the roots of $f(x)=0$.\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\nOne root is clearly $r_0 = 0$.\nThe other four roots are the roots of the polynomial $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nTo find the valuations of the roots of $g(x)$, we use the Newton polygon method with respect to the prime $p=2$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe coefficients of $g(x)$ are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$.\nTheir 2-adic valuations are $v_2(a_4)=3, v_2(a_3)=2, v_2(a_2)=2, v_2(a_1)=0, v_2(a_0)=3$.\nThe points for the polygon are: $(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,0), (0,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(0,3)$. The slope is $(3-0)/(0-1) = -3$. The horizontal length of this segment is $1-0=1$. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $r_1$, with valuation $v_2(r_1) = -(\\text{slope}) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  A segment from $(4,3)$ to $(1,0)$. The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The horizontal length is $4-1=3$. This corresponds to three roots, let's call them $r_2, r_3, r_4$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$.\n\nSo, the roots of $f(x)$ are $r_0=0$, $r_1$ with $v_2(r_1)=3$, and $r_2, r_3, r_4$ with $v_2(r_{2,3,4})=-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2-adic distances between the roots**\nWe calculate the valuations of the differences of these roots:\n*   $v_2(r_0 - r_1) = v_2(-r_1) = v_2(r_1) = 3$.\n*   For $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, $v_2(r_0 - r_i) = v_2(-r_i) = v_2(r_i) = -1$.\n*   For $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, $v_2(r_1 - r_i) = \\min(v_2(r_1), v_2(r_i)) = \\min(3, -1) = -1$.\n*   For $i, j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$ and $i \\ne j$, we have $v_2(r_i - r_j) = -1$. (This can be confirmed by analyzing the residual polynomial for the slope -1 segment, which is irreducible, implying its roots are distinct in the residue field extension).\n\nThe key observation is that two roots, $r_0$ and $r_1$, are much \"closer\" to each other in the 2-adic sense ($v_2(r_0-r_1)=3$) than to any other root. All other pairwise distances are -1.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\nThe structure of the stable reduction's dual graph is determined by this clustering of roots. The set of all branch points is $B=\\{r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_\\infty\\}$.\nThe large valuation difference suggests that the branch points are partitioned into two sets: $P_1 = \\{r_0, r_1\\}$ and $P_2 = \\{r_2, r_3, r_4, r_\\infty\\}$.\nThis partition corresponds to the stable model having two components, say $C_1$ and $C_2$, where the branch points in $P_1$ are attached to $C_1$ and those in $P_2$ are attached to $C_2$. The two components intersect in a number of double points (nodes). Let this number be $d$.\n\nThe dual graph of the stable reduction is a tree. We can relate the genus of the original curve to the genera of the components and the number of nodes. The main formula is:\n$g = g_1 + g_2 + d - 1$\nHere, $g=2$ is the genus of the original curve. $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the genera of the components $C_1$ and $C_2$. $d$ is the number of double points connecting them.\n$2 = g_1 + g_2 + d - 1 \\implies 3 = g_1 + g_2 + d$.\n\nThe genus of each component is determined by the number of branch points it carries and the number of nodes on it. The formula is $2g_i - 2 + n_i + d_i = 0$, where $n_i$ is the number of branch points on component $C_i$ and $d_i$ is the number of nodes on it.\n*   For component $C_1$: It carries the 2 branch points from $P_1$, so $n_1=2$. It has $d$ nodes connecting it to $C_2$, so $d_1=d$. The formula becomes $2g_1 - 2 + 2 + d = 0 \\implies 2g_1 + d = 0$. Since $g_1 \\ge 0$ and $d \\ge 1$, this formula cannot be correct as stated. A common confusion arises with this formula. The correct formulation in this context for a component which is a covering of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is simpler.\n\nLet's use the well-established result for this partition structure. The component $C_1$ is a hyperelliptic curve whose branch points are the 2 points from $P_1$. A 2-sheeted cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ branched at 2 points is a rational curve, so its genus is $g_1=0$.\nThe component $C_2$ is a hyperelliptic curve branched at the 4 points in $P_2$. A 2-sheeted cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ branched at 4 points is an elliptic curve, so its genus is $g_2=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these genera back into the main formula:\n$3 = g_1 + g_2 + d$\n$3 = 0 + 1 + d$\n$d = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction consists of a rational curve ($C_1$, genus 0) and an elliptic curve ($C_2$, genus 1) intersecting at 2 points. The number of double points is the number of these intersection points.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe stable reduction of the given curve has two components that intersect transversally at two points. These two points are the only singularities (double points) of the stable reduction.\n\nThe number of double points is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
