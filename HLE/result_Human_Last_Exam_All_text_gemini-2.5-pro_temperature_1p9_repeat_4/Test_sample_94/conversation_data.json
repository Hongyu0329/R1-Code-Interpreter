    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Components:**\n    *   **Who?** The question asks for the name of a physicist.\n    *   **What is their primary field?** They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This is a major clue, pointing away from physicists famous for other areas like relativity or quantum mechanics.\n    *   **What did they discover?** An \"optical effect in real imagery.\" Real images are formed where light rays converge, such as from a concave mirror or a converging lens.\n    *   **How was it discovered?** The discovery was initiated by an \"accidental observation by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" This is a very specific historical anecdote.\n\n### Listing the Careful Points\n\n*   **The Anecdote is Key:** The story about the custodial worker is the most unique identifier. Finding this specific story will almost certainly lead to the correct physicist.\n*   **Concave Mirrors and Real Imagery:** A concave mirror can focus parallel light rays to a point (the focal point) and can form a real, inverted image of an object placed beyond its focal point. The observation of a clear \"real image\" is the central part of the optical effect.\n*   **Connecting to Microscopy:** The answer must be a person whose legacy is primarily in microscopy. The discovered optical principle must have a direct and significant application in that field.\n*   **Identifying the \"Optical Effect\":** The effect isn't just a random observation; it's a specific principle of illumination that the physicist understood and systematized.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\n1.  **Following the Anecdote:** We search for the story of a scientific discovery involving a janitor or custodian and mirrors. This leads us to the story behind the development of a critical microscopy technique.\n2.  **The Physicist and the Observation:** The story involves German physicist **August Köhler** (1866-1948), who was working at the University of Jena. A custodial worker was cleaning a large concave mirror used as a reflector for a projection arc lamp. The worker noticed that a perfectly sharp, real image of the lamp's glowing carbon filament was being projected onto a nearby screen or wall.\n3.  **The Insight:** When this was brought to Köhler's attention, he had a flash of insight. At the time, illuminating microscope samples was a major problem. If you simply focused the light source onto the sample, you would see a distracting image of the uneven filament superimposed on the image of your specimen. Köhler realized that the principle he had just seen could be used to solve this.\n4.  **The Optical Effect and its Application (Köhler Illumination):** Köhler devised an optical system for the microscope. By using a collector lens and a diaphragm, he could project a focused image of the light source onto the condenser diaphragm. The condenser would then project the light through the specimen, but because the light source itself was not in focus at the specimen plane, the illumination was perfectly even and bright. This technique, called **Köhler illumination**, became the gold standard for high-quality light microscopy and is still used today.\n5.  **Verifying the Clues:**\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, August Köhler.\n    *   **Better known for microscopy?** Absolutely. Köhler illumination is one of the most fundamental principles of modern light microscopy.\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, the principle of creating a real image of the light source in a conjugate plane to the specimen plane to achieve even illumination.\n    *   **Accidental observation by a custodial worker?** Yes, the story confirms this was the catalyst for his insight.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the physicist in question is August Köhler.\n\n<<<August Köhler>>>"
