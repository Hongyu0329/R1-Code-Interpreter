    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position it started with.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify the ballet step from the given options where the final position of the feet is identical to the initial position. This means if a step starts with the right foot in front in fifth position, it must also end with the right foot in front in fifth position.\n\n**Step-by-step breakdown of each option:**\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** This is a vertical jump from two feet. The term \"six\" refers to six movements (three openings and three closings of the legs) in the air. All even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) are inherently \"changé,\" meaning they change feet. The legs beat multiple times, and the jump concludes by landing in fifth position with the feet switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** If you start with the right foot front, you will land with the left foot front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Échappé* means to escape. The dancer jumps from fifth position to second position and then back to fifth. *Battu* means the legs beat together as they close from second position. The word *changé* explicitly means \"changed.\"\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer will land in fifth position with the opposite foot in front. If starting with the right foot front, the dancer will end with the left foot front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position, as indicated by the name of the step.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** The name means \"to assemble.\" In a basic *assemblé*, the working leg brushes out (to the front, side, or back), the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and then both legs are \"assembled\" together in the air to land simultaneously on two feet in fifth position. In many fundamental versions of this step (like *assemblé devant*, *derrière*, or a simple *côté*), the working leg returns to its original spot. For example, starting with the right foot in front, one can brush the right foot to the side and land back in fifth position with the right foot still in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** While there are traveling versions of assemblé (*dessus*, *dessous*) that do change the feet, the basic, non-traveling assemblé does not. Therefore, it is possible and common for an assemblé to end in the exact same position it began.\n*   **Conclusion:** This step can end in the same position as it started.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. *Derrière* means \"behind.\" The dancer starts in plié, glides the back foot out to the side, transfers weight, and then the front foot glides in to close in fifth position *behind* the other foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** If you start with the right foot in front, the right foot will close in the back. The feet have changed position.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** This is a decorative step, often described as a *pas de chat* where each leg performs a *rond de jambe* in the air. In a standard *gargouillade*, the dancer jumps by lifting one leg (e.g., the right), performs a quick *rond de jambe*, and as it comes down, the other leg (left) comes up to do the same, landing with the feet switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** Like a standard *pas de chat*, the feet typically change. If you lead with the right foot, the left foot will land in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**Final Analysis:**\nComparing the options, *Entrechat six*, *Échappé battu changé*, *Glissade derrière*, and *Gargouillade* (in its common form) all inherently involve changing the feet from their starting position. *Assemblé* is the only step on the list that has common, fundamental variations where the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n<<<C>>>"
