    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Work:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action 1:** A character visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Action 2:** This character describes the religious practices of the people in that city.\n    *   **Specific Detail:** The description is a clear allusion that contemporary readers would recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus (the founding myth of Rome). The key image here is a she-wolf suckling twin infants.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this specific character.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Plot and Characters of *The House of the Wolfings***:\n    *   The novel is about a tribe of Goths, the Wolfings, defending their homeland (the Mark) from an invading Roman legion.\n    *   The main protagonist is **Thiodolf**, the War-Duke of the Wolfings. A central element of his character is that he is of the Goths but has a mysterious past that connects him to the Romans. He spent part of his youth among them. This makes him the most likely candidate to have visited a Roman city and have firsthand knowledge of their culture.\n    *   Other characters like his daughter **Hall-Sun** or wife **Wood-Sun** are natives of the Mark and have not traveled to Roman lands.\n    *   The story opens with the Goths gathering for a tribal council or \"Mote\" to discuss the Roman threat. This is a logical place for a character to share knowledge about the enemy.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Scene in the Text:**\n    *   Early in the book, during the Mote, various leaders speak. When it is his turn, Thiodolf addresses the assembly.\n    *   He uses his unique personal experience to explain the nature of the Romans to his fellow Goths, who only know them as invaders.\n    *   He describes the Romans' city, their governance, and their character. To explain their inherent warlike nature and origin, he describes a sacred image he saw there.\n\n4.  **Identify the Allusion to Romulus and Remus:**\n    *   In Chapter II, \"The Mote of the Wolfings,\" Thiodolf gives his speech.\n    *   He says he has been in their \"greatest city\" and seen their \"holy things.\"\n    *   He describes a specific carving or statue: \"...they bear on a shield the image of a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children; for they say that such a beast was the first mother of their first king and his brother...\"\n    *   This is a direct and unmistakable reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus being found and suckled by a she-wolf (Lupa) before they went on to found Rome.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:**\n    *   The character who has been to a Roman city is Thiodolf.\n    *   The character who describes their \"holy things\" is Thiodolf.\n    *   The character who specifically describes the image of a she-wolf suckling two \"man-children\" is Thiodolf.\n    *   Therefore, the correct answer is Thiodolf.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Characters:** It is crucial to distinguish Thiodolf from the other Goths. His past among the Romans gives him a unique perspective that no one else in the tribe possesses.\n*   **Context of the Description:** The description is not just a random travelogue. Thiodolf uses it strategically in his speech to characterize the Romans as a predatory people, \"the sons of the Wolf,\" to motivate his own people, the Wolfings, for the coming war.\n*   **The accuracy of the Allusion:** Morris's phrasing, \"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children,\" is designed to be a direct and easily recognizable reference to the famous Capitoline Wolf statue and the Roman foundation myth.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
