    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Goal\nThe main objective is to find the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum (`Δp`) to its actual momentum (`p`) while it is in the first Bohr orbit (`n=1`). This can be written as the expression `Δp / p`.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Given Information\n*   **Particle:** Electron.\n*   **State:** First Bohr orbit, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 1`.\n*   **Given value:** The uncertainty in the electron's position, `Δx = 10 pm`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Necessary Physical Principles and Formulas\nTo find the required ratio, we need to calculate two quantities: `Δp` and `p`.\n\n1.  **To find the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`):** We use **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position (`Δx`) and the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. For calculation purposes, we consider the minimum uncertainty:\n    `Δx * Δp = ħ / 2`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / 2π`).\n    From this, we can express `Δp` as: `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n\n2.  **To find the momentum (`p`):** We use **Bohr's Model of the Atom**. For an electron in a stable orbit, Bohr's quantization condition for angular momentum (`L`) is:\n    `L = mvr = nħ`\n    where `m` is the mass of the electron, `v` is its velocity, `r` is the orbital radius, and `n` is the principal quantum number.\n    The linear momentum of the electron is `p = mv`. By rearranging the angular momentum equation, we get:\n    `p = mv = nħ / r`\n    For the first Bohr orbit, `n = 1` and the radius `r` is the Bohr radius, `a₀`. So, the momentum is: `p = ħ / a₀`.\n\n### Step 4: List Careful Points and Required Constants\n*   **Units:** The position uncertainty (`Δx`) is given in picometers (pm). It's crucial to be consistent with units. We can convert everything to SI units (meters) or notice that the ratio might allow units to cancel out.\n    *   `1 pm = 10⁻¹² m`\n    *   So, `Δx = 10 pm = 10 * 10⁻¹² m = 10⁻¹¹ m`.\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   **Reduced Planck Constant (`ħ`):** `1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`.\n    *   **Bohr Radius (`a₀`):** This is the radius of the first orbit (`n=1`). `a₀ = 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m` (which is `52.9 pm`).\n*   **Simplification:** Before plugging in numbers, it's often wise to simplify the final expression symbolically. This can reduce calculation steps and potential rounding errors.\n    *   The ratio we want is `Δp / p`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions from Step 3: `(ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)`.\n    *   Simplify the complex fraction: `Δp / p = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) * (a₀ / ħ)`.\n    *   The reduced Planck constant `ħ` cancels out, leaving a much simpler expression: `Δp / p = a₀ / (2 * Δx)`.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Calculation\nNow we use the simplified expression and the given values.\n\n1.  **Expression:**\n    Ratio = `a₀ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n2.  **Values:**\n    *   `a₀ = 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m` (or `52.9 pm`)\n    *   `Δx = 10 pm`\n\n3.  **Calculation (using pm for consistency):**\n    Ratio = `52.9 pm / (2 * 10 pm)`\n    Ratio = `52.9 / 20`\n    Ratio = `2.645`\n\nThe final ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nThe step-by-step analysis yields the following result:\n1.  The uncertainty in momentum is `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n2.  The momentum in the first Bohr orbit is `p = ħ / a₀`.\n3.  The ratio is `Δp / p = a₀ / (2 * Δx)`.\n4.  Plugging in `a₀ = 52.9 pm` and `Δx = 10 pm`, the ratio is `52.9 / (2 * 10) = 2.645`.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
