    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the relationship between the bare Green's function ($G_0$) and single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)\n\nThe bare (or non-interacting) single-particle Green's function, $G_0$, is a propagator. It describes the probability amplitude for a particle (or hole) to propagate from one spacetime point to another in the *absence* of any interactions.\n\nIn the operator formalism, the time-ordered fermionic Green's function is defined as the expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators in the non-interacting ground state $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$:\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle \\Phi_0 | T[\\psi(x, t) \\psi^\\dagger(x', t')] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$\nwhere $T$ is the time-ordering operator.\n\n### Step 2: Path Integral Representation\n\nThe Feynman path integral formalism provides an alternative, often more convenient, way to calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes. In this framework, the Green's function is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations (histories):\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x, t) \\bar{\\psi}(x', t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ are Grassmann-valued fields (representing fermions).\n*   $\\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is the functional integration measure over all field configurations.\n*   $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system.\n\n### Step 3: The Non-Interacting Action $S_0$ and Energy Eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$\n\nThe action is the integral of the Lagrangian density, $S_0 = \\int dt \\, d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_0$. For a non-interacting system, the Lagrangian density is typically:\n$\\mathcal{L}_0 = \\bar{\\psi}(x, t) (i\\hbar \\partial_t - H_0) \\psi(x, t)$\n\nwhere $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator. The energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian:\n$H_0 \\phi_k(x) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(x)$\nHere, $\\phi_k(x)$ are the corresponding energy eigenfunctions, which form a complete and orthonormal basis. The index $k$ can represent momentum, spin, or any other relevant quantum numbers.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The crucial step is to express the action in a basis where $H_0$ is diagonal. This will make the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ explicit. We expand the fields $\\psi(x, t)$ in terms of the eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$:\n$\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n\nSubstituting this into the action and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int \\phi_k^*(x) \\phi_{k'}(x) d^d x = \\delta_{k,k'}$), the action simplifies and decouples for each mode $k$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, \\bar{c}_k(t) (i\\hbar \\partial_t - \\epsilon_k) c_k(t)$\n\n### Step 4: Fourier Transformation to Frequency Space\n\nThe calculation is simplified further by performing a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency ($\\omega$) domain. (From now on, we set $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity).\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} c_k(\\omega)$\n\nThe time derivative $i\\partial_t$ becomes a multiplication by $\\omega$. The action in the frequency-momentum basis becomes completely diagonal:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\bar{c}_k(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This form explicitly shows that for each quantum state $k$, the dynamics are governed by the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. This algebraic term is the kernel of the quadratic action.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Green's Function\n\nThe Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the Fourier transform of $G_0(k, t-t') = -i\\langle T[c_k(t) \\bar{c}_k(t')]\\rangle_0$. In the path integral, it corresponds to the expectation value $\\langle c_k(\\omega) \\bar{c}_k(\\omega) \\rangle$. For a Gaussian action of the form $S = \\int d\\omega \\, \\bar{c}(\\omega) M(\\omega) c(\\omega)$, the Green's function (propagator) is the inverse of the kernel $M(\\omega)$.\n\nIn our case, the kernel of the action (up to a factor of $i$ from $e^{iS_0}$) is $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, the Green's function is its inverse:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The expression has a pole when the frequency $\\omega$ is equal to the particle's energy $\\epsilon_k$. To give this physical meaning and ensure causality (as encoded by the time-ordering operator $T$), an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), must be added. The Feynman prescription, consistent with the time-ordered product, dictates the sign of $i\\delta$ based on whether the state $k$ is occupied or empty relative to the Fermi energy $\\mu$.\n*   For an unoccupied state (particle propagation, $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$): The pole must be in the lower half-plane.\n*   For an occupied state (hole propagation, $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$): The pole must be in the upper half-plane.\n\nThis leads to the final expression for the bare Feynman Green's function at zero temperature:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Final Analysis\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is direct and simple. In the frequency-momentum representation, which is the natural basis for a non-interacting system, the Green's function for a state $k$ and frequency $\\omega$, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, depends on $\\epsilon_k$ as an **inverse function**. The pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane is located at the energy of the single-particle excitation, $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This means the system has a sharp, well-defined resonance at the single-particle energy. The entire dependence on the specific quantum state $k$ is encapsulated by its energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n***\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum domain, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, has a simple inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The precise relationship is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nwhere the term $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary part whose sign is determined by the specific boundary conditions (e.g., for a time-ordered Green's function at T=0, it is $i\\delta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$, with $\\mu$ being the chemical potential). The essential dependence is the $1/(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ form, which indicates that the Green's function has a pole at the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
