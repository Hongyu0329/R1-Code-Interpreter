    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Object of Study\nThe question is about the representation theory of the quantized universal enveloping algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is generated by elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ with certain relations. The key feature of the \"root of unity\" case is that the representation theory is not semisimple. This means that not every representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations. In particular, there can be representations that are **indecomposable** (cannot be written as a direct sum of proper subrepresentations) but **not irreducible** (do contain a proper non-trivial subrepresentation).\n\nThe category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of this algebra. We want to find the ratio of irreducible objects to all indecomposable objects in this category.\n\n### Step 2: The Role of the Center at a Root of Unity\nWhen $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity (in our case, $l=3$), the center of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ becomes much larger than in the generic case. Specifically, the elements $E^l, F^l, K^l$ are central. For our problem, $l=3$, so $E^3, F^3, K^3$ are central elements.\n\nBy a generalization of Schur's Lemma, any central element must act as a scalar on an indecomposable representation. Thus, for any object $M \\in C$, there exist scalars $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $E^3$ acts as multiplication by $\\alpha$, $F^3$ acts as multiplication by $\\beta$, and $K^3$ acts as multiplication by $\\gamma$. This allows us to classify the indecomposable representations based on these scalars.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Representations based on Central Characters\n\nWe can divide the representations in $C$ into two types.\n\n**Type 1: The Nilpotent Block ($\\alpha = \\beta = 0$)**\nThis is the subcategory of representations where both $E^3$ and $F^3$ act as zero. This subcategory is known as the principal or nilpotent block. This block is not semisimple and contains interesting indecomposable modules. For $l=3$, the indecomposable objects in this block are completely classified. They are:\n\n*   **The simple (irreducible) modules:**\n    1.  $L(0)$: The trivial representation, dimension 1.\n    2.  $L(1)$: An irreducible representation of dimension 2.\n    3.  $L(2)$: An irreducible representation of dimension $l=3$.\n*   **The indecomposable but not irreducible modules:**\n    These are the projective covers of the non-projective simple modules.\n    4.  $P(0)$: The projective cover of $L(0)$. It has composition factors $L(0), L(1), L(0)$ and has dimension $1+2+1=4$. Since it has submodules, it is not irreducible.\n    5.  $P(1)$: The projective cover of $L(1)$. It has composition factors $L(1), L(0), L(1)$ and has dimension $2+1+2=5$. It is also not irreducible.\n\nIt's a known result that the module $L(2)$ is also projective, so $P(2) = L(2)$. Therefore, in the nilpotent block, there are a total of **5** non-isomorphic indecomposable objects. Out of these, **3** are irreducible ($L(0), L(1), L(2)$) and **2** are indecomposable but not irreducible ($P(0), P(1)$).\n\n**Type 2: The Semisimple Blocks (at least one of $\\alpha, \\beta$ is non-zero)**\nThis is the subcategory of representations where at least one of $E^3$ or $F^3$ acts non-trivially (i.e., by a non-zero scalar). A fundamental theorem in the theory states that these blocks are **semisimple**.\n\n*   **Semisimplicity implies `Indecomposable = Irreducible`**: In a semisimple category, every object is a direct sum of simple (irreducible) objects. Therefore, the only indecomposable objects are the simple ones themselves.\n*   **Counting the objects**: For these blocks, all indecomposable representations are irreducible. It turns out that there is an infinite family of such irreducible representations. They all have dimension $l=3$ and are parametrized by the central characters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ (subject to a constraint) and another parameter.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nLet's tally the objects in the category $C$.\n*   **Set of all indecomposable objects (isomorphism classes):**\n    $Ind = \\{L(0), L(1), L(2), P(0), P(1)\\} \\cup \\{\\text{infinite family of Type 2 irreducibles}\\}$\n*   **Set of all irreducible objects (isomorphism classes):**\n    $Irr = \\{L(0), L(1), L(2)\\} \\cup \\{\\text{infinite family of Type 2 irreducibles}\\}$\n\nThe set of all indecomposable objects is the union of the set of all irreducible objects and the set containing the two modules $\\{P(0), P(1)\\}$. The number of indecomposable modules that are *not* irreducible is exactly 2. The total number of irreducible modules is infinite.\n\nThe question asks for the \"percentage of the objects of C are irreducible\". This can be expressed as the ratio:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{|\\text{Irr}|}{|\\text{Ind}|} \\times 100\\% $$\nWe have $|\\text{Irr}|$ is infinite, and $|\\text{Ind}| = |\\text{Irr}| + 2$, which is also infinite. When dealing with infinite sets, the ratio of a set to itself plus a finite number of elements is 1. The finite set of 2 exceptional objects becomes negligible compared to the infinite set of irreducibles.\n\nFormally, if we were to count objects up to a certain complexity (like dimension), the number of irreducibles would grow infinitely while the number of indecomposable-but-not-irreducible objects would remain fixed at 2. The limit of the ratio would be 1.\n$$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{(\\text{Number of irreducibles in a large sample } S_N)}{(\\text{Number of indecomposables in } S_N)} = \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty+2} = 1 $$\nSo, 100% of the objects in $C$ are irreducible.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  Correctly identify that $q$ being a third root of unity means we are in the non-semisimple case for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $l=3$.\n2.  Use the action of the center ($E^3, F^3, K^3$) to classify all indecomposable representations.\n3.  Correctly analyze the nilpotent block ($E^3, F^3$ act as 0), finding 5 indecomposable objects, only 3 of which are irreducible. This is the only place where indecomposable and irreducible differ.\n4.  Correctly identify that all other blocks are semisimple, meaning every indecomposable object in them is irreducible.\n5.  Note that there is an infinite number of these other irreducible/indecomposable objects.\n6.  Conclude that the total number of indecomposable objects that are not irreducible is a finite number (2), while the total number of irreducible objects is infinite.\n7.  Interpret the \"percentage\" correctly for infinite sets, leading to the conclusion that the finite number of exceptions is a set of measure zero.\n\nThe percentage of objects of $C$ that are irreducible is 100%.\n\n<<<100>>>"
