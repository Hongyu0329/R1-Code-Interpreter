    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:**\n    *   **\"first statute\"**: We are looking for the earliest law in chronological order.\n    *   **\"in the modern State of Israel\"**: This means a law passed by the Knesset after the state's establishment in 1948. It excludes laws from the Ottoman Empire or the British Mandate, even if they were incorporated into Israeli law (unless they were re-enacted as new original statutes).\n    *   **\"explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must use the specific Hebrew legal term for \"good faith,\" which is **\"תום לב\"** (pronounced \"tom lev\"). A law that only implies the concept through related ideas like \"fairness\" or \"loyalty\" would not qualify.\n    *   **\"concept of 'good faith'\"**: This refers to the principle requiring parties to act honestly and fairly in their dealings.\n\n2.  **Initial Investigation & Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   Many people associate \"good faith\" in Israeli law with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is indeed seminal because its sections 12 and 39 established good faith as a fundamental, overarching principle governing all contracts (both in negotiation and performance). However, the question asks for the *first* statute, not the most famous or most comprehensive one. Thus, we must look for legislation prior to 1973.\n\n3.  **Exploring Pre-1973 Statutes:**\n    *   A new wave of private law codification began in Israel in the 1960s to replace the older, inherited legal framework. It is within these new laws that the term \"good faith\" started to appear in specific contexts.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965**: This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (**\"נאמנות\"** - \"ne'emanut\") on an agent toward their principal. While related to good faith, it is a distinct legal term and concept. The statute does not use the explicit term \"תום לב\".\n    *   **Land Law, 1969**: This is a strong candidate. Section 9 of the Land Law deals with conflicting transactions and gives priority to a later buyer if they acted **\"in good faith\"** (\"בְּתֹם-לֵב\"), paid consideration, and completed the registration. This explicitly uses the required term and predates the 1973 Contracts Law. However, we must check if there is an even earlier statute.\n    *   **Pledges Law, 1967**: This law governs the creation and effect of pledges (a form of security interest). Let's examine its text. Section 5, which deals with the \"market overt\" rule for pledges, states that a pledge is valid even if the pledgor was not the owner, provided the creditor (the pledgee) acted **\"in good faith\"** (\"בְּתֹם-לֵב\").\n\n4.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   The **Pledges Law** was enacted in **1967**.\n    *   The **Land Law** was enacted in **1969**.\n    *   The Pledges Law of 1967 clearly predates the Land Law of 1969. A chronological review of other private law statutes from that period (e.g., Guarantee Law, 1967; Sale Law, 1968) confirms that the Pledges Law appears to be the first original Knesset legislation to incorporate the explicit term \"תום לב\".\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit Term vs. Implied Concept:** The key is the explicit use of \"תום לב\". Other laws might deal with fairness or honesty using different terminology (like \"loyalty\" in the Agency Law or \"prejudicial term\" in the Standard Contracts Law, 1964), but they do not meet the question's specific requirement.\n*   **Original Knesset Legislation:** The focus is on statutes passed by the Israeli parliament, not on \"New Versions\" (נוסח חדש) of British Mandate ordinances. While those ordinances became part of Israeli law, the question pertains to statutes originating from the legislative body of the \"modern State of Israel.\"\n*   **Specific Application vs. General Principle:** The first appearances of \"good faith\" were in statutes addressing specific situations (like receiving a pledge or buying land). The elevation of \"good faith\" to a general, overarching principle applicable to all contracts occurred later, in the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Pledges Law of 1967 is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Pledges Law>>>"
