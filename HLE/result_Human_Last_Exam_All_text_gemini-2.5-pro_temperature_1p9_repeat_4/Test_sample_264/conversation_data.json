    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Coordinate System and the First Cube\n\nFirst, let's place one of the cubes, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define Cube A as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThis places one corner of Cube A at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the opposite corner at (1, 1, 1). The side length is `1 - 0 = 1`, as specified in the problem.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Shift and Define the Second Cube\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted by 1/2 \"along the main diagonal\" relative to the first.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Interpreting the \"Main Diagonal\" and the Shift.**\n    The main diagonal of Cube A connects the corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner at (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is `<1, 1, 1>`. The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most reasonably interpreted as shifting by 1/2 in each of the coordinate directions that define the diagonal. This means the shift is described by the vector `<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n    *(An alternative, less likely interpretation would be a total displacement distance of 1/2, which would require normalizing the diagonal vector. However, the phrasing strongly suggests the simpler component-wise shift).*\n\nApplying this shift vector `<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>` to Cube A gives us the position of Cube B. To find the new boundaries for Cube B, we add 1/2 to the original boundaries of Cube A:\n*   For x: `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   For y: `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   For z: `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\nSo, Cube B is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Region of Intersection\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space where a point (x, y, z) belongs to *both* Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we need to find the range of x, y, and z that satisfies the inequalities for both cubes simultaneously.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** We need `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which simplifies to `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** We need `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which simplifies to `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** We need `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The overlapping interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which simplifies to `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Finding the intersection interval.** The key is to take the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds for each dimension.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a new solid defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\n\nThe region of intersection we found is itself a cube. Let's determine its side length.\n\n*   Length along the x-axis: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length along the y-axis: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length along the z-axis: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\nThe volume of a cube is calculated as `(side length)³`.\nVolume of intersection = `(1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`.\n\nFinal verification: The three planes `x=1/2`, `y=1/2`, `z=1/2` pass through the center of the original cube and divide it into 8 equal smaller cubes, each with a volume of 1/8. The intersection we found is exactly one of these small cubes—the one extending from the center `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)` to the far corner `(1, 1, 1)`. The calculation is correct.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
