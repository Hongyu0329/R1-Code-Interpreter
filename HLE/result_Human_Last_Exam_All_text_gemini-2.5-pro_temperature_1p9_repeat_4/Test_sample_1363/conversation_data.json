    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The core of the question is identifying a dance where the fundamental technique makes it \"impossible\" to \"overturn\" a \"reverse turn.\"\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left.\n    *   **Overturn:** To turn more than the prescribed amount for that figure. For example, if a step is meant to turn 3/8, overturning it would mean turning 1/2 or more.\n    *   **Without disregarding the technique:** This is the most critical constraint. It means we must adhere to the core principles of the specific dance (e.g., footwork, timing, body action, CBM, rise and fall).\n\n2.  **Analyze each dance option based on its technique:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz & B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot & E. Quickstep:** These four dances belong to the category of \"swing dances.\" A defining characteristic of swing dances is the use of continuous, flowing movement, momentum, body sway, and **Contra Body Movement (CBM)** to initiate turns. CBM is the action of turning the opposite side of the body towards the moving foot, which generates rotation. This inherent rotational mechanism allows for flexibility in the amount of turn. While there are standard amounts of turn for figures, experienced dancers can and do adjust this rotation (overturning or underturning) for choreography, floorcraft, or to change alignment into the next figure. Doing so is an advanced skill, not a violation of fundamental technique. For instance, in an English Waltz, one can easily overturn the first three steps of a reverse turn from the standard 3/8 to 1/2 without breaking the rules of CBM, sway, or footwork.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango (International Tango):** Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its character is sharp, staccato, and grounded.\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is performed on a level plane.\n        *   **No Body Sway:** Unlike the other dances, there is no sway from side to side.\n        *   **Specific Lack of CBM:** This is the crucial point for the reverse turn. Let's look at the leader's steps for a standard Open Reverse Turn:\n            1.  Left Foot forward (often with CBMP - Contra Body Movement Position, but not the *action* of CBM).\n            2.  Right Foot to the side.\n            3.  Left Foot back (Partner Outside).\n        *   On **Step 2**, the side step, the technique explicitly forbids the use of CBM (the turning of the body against the stepping foot). In swing dances, this CBM action is what generates the turn. In Tango, the turn on this step is created by a swivel on the standing foot *after* the moving foot is placed. The body does not rotate over the feet.\n        *   Because there is no CBM to generate rotational momentum, it is technically impossible to \"overturn\" the figure. Attempting to force more rotation would require introducing CBM, which would be a clear and fundamental violation of Tango technique. You would essentially be dancing a Waltz reverse turn action, which is incorrect for Tango. The sharp, non-rotational placement of the feet inherently limits the amount of possible turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, and Viennese Waltz, the use of CBM and momentum makes overturning a reverse turn a possible (and often utilized) choreographic choice. In European Tango, the strict technical rule of \"No CBM\" on the critical side-step of the reverse turn makes it impossible to add extra rotation without fundamentally breaking the technique of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
