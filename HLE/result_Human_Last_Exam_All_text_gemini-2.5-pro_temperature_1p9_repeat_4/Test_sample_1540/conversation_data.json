    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length. The primary constraint is to devise a C program that is as memory-efficient as possible and to calculate the total memory (`m`) in bytes used by the variables in that program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** We need to compare two strings, let's call them `s1` and `s2`. The comparison must ignore the letter case (e.g., 'a' is equal to 'A'). The strings are guaranteed to have the same length, ranging from 1 to 100 characters. We must output -1, 1, or 0 based on the comparison result. The key challenge is to minimize the memory used by our program's variables.\n\n2.  **Devising a Basic Algorithm:** A simple way to solve this is to read both strings into two character arrays. Then, we can loop through the arrays from the beginning, convert the characters at the current position to a common case (e.g., lowercase), and compare them. The first position where the characters differ determines the lexicographical order. If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal.\n\n3.  **Optimizing for Memory:** The basic algorithm requires two buffers, each capable of holding a string of up to 100 characters plus a null terminator (`\\0`). This means two arrays of size 101 (`char s1[101], s2[101]`), which consume `101 + 101 = 202` bytes. To be more memory-efficient, we should try to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously.\n\n4.  **Developing a Memory-Efficient Algorithm:** The input is provided on two separate lines. This means we must finish reading the entire first line before we can start reading the second. Consequently, we are forced to store the first string in a buffer. However, we do not need to store the entire second string. We can read it one character at a time and compare it against the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n\n    The most memory-efficient algorithm is as follows:\n    a. Allocate a buffer for the first string: `char s1[101];`\n    b. Read the first string into `s1`.\n    c. After reading the first string with `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`, the newline character `\\n` remains in the input buffer. We must consume it before we can read the second string character by character. A simple `getchar();` or a loop `while(getchar() != '\\n');` will do.\n    d. Iterate through the stored string `s1` using an index `i`.\n    e. In each iteration, read a single character of the second string into a variable, say `c2`, using `getchar()`.\n    f. Compare `tolower(s1[i])` and `tolower(c2)`.\n    g. If they differ, print `-1` or `1` and exit.\n    h. If the loop finishes, the strings are equal, so print `0`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Variable Data Types:** To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for each variable. The string length is at most 100, so a loop counter can be a `char` (1 byte) instead of an `int` (usually 4 bytes).\n*   **Buffer Size:** The maximum string length is 100. A character array in C needs one extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`). Thus, the buffer size must be at least `100 + 1 = 101`.\n*   **Input Buffer Handling:** `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` stops reading at the first whitespace character. When reading line by line, this leaves the newline character (`\\n`) in the buffer. This must be consumed before using `getchar()` to read the next line's content.\n*   **Function Calls:** Using standard library functions like `tolower()` does not typically add to the declared variable memory count, as their temporary storage is managed in registers or on the call stack temporarily.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation\n\nFollowing the memory-efficient algorithm, let's identify the necessary variables and calculate their total size in bytes. We assume standard data type sizes (`char` = 1 byte).\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** `char s1[101];`\n    *   Size = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop counter:** An index is needed to traverse `s1`. Since the maximum length is 100, a `char` is sufficient. `char i;`\n    *   Size = `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Variable for the second string's character:** We need a variable to hold each character from the second string as it is read. `char c2;`\n    *   Size = `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n\n`m = (memory for s1) + (memory for i) + (memory for c2)`\n`m = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103`\n\nThis is the minimum required memory for variables to solve the problem correctly.\n\n<<<103>>>"
