    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely determined by a partition of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$, where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\ldots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i = n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $f_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula. However, for partitions with a few parts or a specific \"hook\" shape, simpler formulas exist. We are looking for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that $f_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\nThe general principle is that partitions that are \"long and thin\" (like $(n-k, 1^k)$) or \"tall and narrow\" (their conjugates) have small dimensions, while partitions that are more \"central\" (with diagrams closer to a square shape) have very large dimensions.\n\nWe will systematically check partitions, starting from those most likely to have small dimensions. For each partition $\\lambda$ we find, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ will have the same dimension, $f_\\lambda = f_{\\lambda'}$. Unless a partition is self-conjugate ($\\lambda = \\lambda'$), this will give us two irreps for each calculation.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of partitions $\\lambda \\vdash 25$:**\n\n1.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=25$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: The trivial representation. $f_{(25)} = 1$.\n    *   Conjugate: $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$, the sign representation. $f_{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    *   (2 irreps)\n\n2.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=24$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (24,1)$: The standard representation. $f_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$.\n    *   Conjugate: $\\lambda' = (2, 1^{23})$. $f_{(2, 1^{23})} = 24$.\n    *   (2 irreps)\n\n3.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=23$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $f_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   Conjugate: $\\lambda' = (2^2, 1^{21})$. $f_{\\lambda'} = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,1,1)$: $f_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = \\frac{24 \\times 23}{2} = 276$.\n    *   Conjugate: $\\lambda' = (3, 1^{22})$. $f_{\\lambda'} = 276$.\n    *   (4 irreps)\n\n4.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=22$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,3)$: $f_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$.

We do not expect to find any more partitions below the limit.\n\n10. **Self-conjugate partitions:**\n    A partition is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$. Such irreps must be counted only once. The self-conjugate partitions are generally more \"central\" and tend to have large dimensions. The \"thinnest\" self-conjugate partition of 25 is $(13,1^{12})$. Its dimension is $f_{(13,1^{12})} = \\binom{24}{12} = 2,704,156$, which is well above the limit. Any other self-conjugate partition will have an even larger dimension.\n\n**Summary of irreps found:**\n*   From $\\lambda_1=25$: 2\n*   From $\\lambda_1=24$: 2\n*   From $\\lambda_1=23$: 4\n*   From $\\lambda_1=22$: 6\n*   From $\\lambda_1=21$: 10\n*   From $\\lambda_1=20$: 12\n*   From $\\lambda_1=19$: 4\n*   From $\\lambda_1=18$: 4\n\nTotal count = $2+2+4+6+10+12+4+4 = 44$.\nAll these partitions are non-self-conjugate, so each corresponds to a distinct pair of irreps ($\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$).\n\nFinal count: 44.\n\n>>> 44"
