    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Dirichlet Character:** A function $\\chi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ that is completely multiplicative, periodic with some period $N$, and $\\chi(n)=0$ if $\\gcd(n,N)>1$. The characters modulo $N$ form a group under multiplication, which is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n*   **Conductor of a Character:** The conductor of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest integer $f$ for which $\\chi$ can be induced from a character modulo $f$.\n*   **Primitive Character:** A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is called primitive if its conductor is $d$.\n*   **Order of a Character:** The order of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\chi^k = \\chi_0$, where $\\chi_0$ is the principal character.\n\n### **Step 2: Factorize the conductor d**\n\nThe given conductor is $d = 53599$. We need to find its prime factorization.\n*   The number is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Trying division by small primes:\n    *   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n    *   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n    *   $589 \\div 19 = 31$\n*   31 is a prime number.\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct odd primes (it's a square-free integer), this simplifies the problem.\n\n### **Step 3: Decompose the character group**\n\nWhen the modulus $d$ is a product of pairwise coprime integers, $d = d_1 d_2 \\dots d_k$, any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $d_i$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$.\nIn our case, $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, so any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo the prime $p$.\n\n### **Step 4: Apply the conditions on the character**\n\nWe have two conditions on the character $\\chi$:\n1.  **It must be primitive with conductor $d$.**\n    For a square-free conductor $d=p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\dots \\chi_{p_k}$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ is primitive modulo $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character. The principal character is the unique character of order 1. Therefore, $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$ for all primes $p$ dividing $d$.\n\n2.  **It must have order 6.**\n    The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the possible orders of the component characters**\n\nLet $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p)=p-1$. The order of any character, $o_p$, must divide $p-1$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$ implies that each individual order $o_p$ must be a divisor of 6. So, $o_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nThe primitivity condition requires $o_p > 1$.\nCombining these, the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's check if characters of these orders exist for each prime factor:\n*   **Modulo 7:** The character group has order $\\phi(7) = 6$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6, characters of these orders exist.\n*   **Modulo 13:** The character group has order $\\phi(13) = 12$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12, characters of these orders exist.\n*   **Modulo 19:** The character group has order $\\phi(19) = 18$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18, characters of these orders exist.\n*   **Modulo 31:** The character group has order $\\phi(31) = 30$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30, characters of these orders exist.\n\nThe number of characters of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (when $k|n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n### **Step 6: Count the valid combinations of characters**\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that their orders $(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})$ satisfy:\n1.  $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for each $p$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nFirst, let's count the total number of primitive character tuples where the order of each component divides 6. This means $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for all $p$.\nFor each prime factor $p$, the number of available characters is the sum of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6:\nNumber of choices for each $\\chi_p = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are four prime factors, the total number of such character tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the combinations where the lcm is not 6. Since all orders are divisors of 6, the lcm not being 6 means the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). Since all orders are greater than 1, the lcm cannot be 1.\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_p) = 6$ fails if the prime factorization of the orders is missing either the prime 2 or the prime 3.\n*   **Case A: The lcm is a divisor of 3.**\n    This means the prime factor 2 is missing from the prime factorization of all orders $o_p$. This requires all $o_p$ to have orders that divide 3. Since $o_p \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, this implies $o_p=3$ for all $p$.\n    The number of characters of order 3 for each prime is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$. The lcm for these is 3.\n\n*   **Case B: The lcm is a divisor of 2.**\n    This means the prime factor 3 is missing from the prime factorization of all orders $o_p$. This requires all $o_p$ to have orders that divide 2. Since $o_p \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, this implies $o_p=2$ for all $p$.\n    The number of characters of order 2 for each prime is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$. The lcm for this tuple is 2.\n\nThe two cases are disjoint. The total number of invalid tuples is the sum of the counts from Case A and Case B, which is $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nFinally, the number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total count of tuples with orders in $\\{2,3,6\\}$ minus the count of invalid tuples:\nNumber of characters = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
