    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) in a basis set depends on the specific atom. We will analyze the 6-311G** basis set for both a representative non-hydrogen (heavy) atom from the second row (e.g., Carbon) and for a Hydrogen atom.\n\n#### **1. Deconstruct the Basis Set Name: 6-311G\\*\\***\n\nFirst, we need to understand what each part of the notation means:\n\n*   **G**: Stands for **Gaussian**, indicating that the basis functions are constructed from Gaussian-type orbitals.\n*   **6-311**: This part describes a **split-valence** basis set. It defines how the core and valence atomic orbitals are represented.\n    *   **6-**: The core orbitals (e.g., 1s for Carbon) are represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **-311**: The valence orbitals (e.g., 2s and 2p for Carbon; 1s for Hydrogen) are \"split\" into three separate basis functions to allow for more flexibility in describing chemical bonding.\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell is described by one CGF made from **3** PGFs.\n        *   The middle part is described by one basis function, which is a single **1** PGF (it's uncontracted).\n        *   The outer part is also described by one basis function, which is a single **1** PGF (it's uncontracted).\n*   **\\*\\***: This denotes the addition of **polarization functions**, which are functions of higher angular momentum needed for an accurate description of bonding anisotropy.\n    *   The first **\\***: Adds a set of **d-type** polarization functions to each non-hydrogen (heavy) atom.\n    *   The second **\\***: Adds a set of **p-type** polarization functions to each hydrogen atom.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Calculation for a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)**\n\nA Carbon atom has 1s (core), 2s (valence), and 2p (valence) orbitals.\n\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):**\n    *   Described by the \"6-\" part.\n    *   This is a single contracted function made from **6** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   Primitives so far: **6**\n\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):**\n    *   Described by the \"-311\" split. This split is applied independently to both s- and p-type valence orbitals.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital:**\n        *   Inner part: A contracted function from **3** s-type primitives.\n        *   Middle part: An uncontracted function, which is **1** s-type primitive.\n        *   Outer part: An uncontracted function, which is **1** s-type primitive.\n        *   Total s-type primitives = 6 (core) + 3 (valence) + 1 (valence) + 1 (valence) = **11 s-primitives**.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z):**\n        *   The same radial split applies to the p-orbitals.\n        *   Inner part: A contracted function from **3** p-type primitives.\n        *   Middle part: An uncontracted function, which is **1** p-type primitive.\n        *   Outer part: An uncontracted function, which is **1** p-type primitive.\n        *   Total p-type primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 p-primitives**.\n\n*   **Polarization Functions (from the first \\*):**\n    *   A set of d-type polarization functions is added.\n    *   In Pople-style basis sets, this is typically a single uncontracted set of 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Each of these 6 functions is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Total d-type primitives = **6 d-primitives**.\n\n*   **Total for a Heavy Atom:**\n    *   Summing up all the primitives: 11 (s-type) + 5 (p-type) + 6 (d-type) = **22 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom**\n\nA Hydrogen atom has no core electrons, only a 1s valence orbital.\n\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):**\n    *   The \"-311\" split applies to the 1s orbital.\n    *   Inner part: A contracted function from **3** s-type primitives.\n    *   Middle part: An uncontracted function, which is **1** s-type primitive.\n    *   Outer part: An uncontracted function, which is **1** s-type primitive.\n    *   Total s-type primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 s-primitives**.\n\n*   **Polarization Functions (from the second \\*):**\n    *   A set of p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z) is added.\n    *   This is an uncontracted set of 3 functions.\n    *   Each of these 3 functions is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Total p-type primitives = **3 p-primitives**.\n\n*   **Total for a Hydrogen Atom:**\n    *   Summing up all the primitives: 5 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n*   The number of primitives is atom-dependent. The question is answered by providing counts for different atom types.\n*   **Primitive vs. Contracted Functions:** The question asks for primitive Gaussians (PGFs), not the final basis functions (CGFs).\n*   **Split Valence:** The `311` notation applies to all valence orbitals of an atom (s and p for heavy atoms, s for hydrogen).\n*   **Polarization:** The `**` notation adds d-functions to heavy atoms and p-functions to hydrogens. Pople basis sets use 6 Cartesian d-functions by default.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom type.\n\n*   For each **second-row heavy atom** (like C, N, O, F), there are **22 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   For each **hydrogen atom**, there are **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n<<<A 6-311G** basis set contains 22 primitive Gaussians for each second-row heavy atom (e.g., C, N, O) and 8 primitive Gaussians for each hydrogen atom.>>>"
