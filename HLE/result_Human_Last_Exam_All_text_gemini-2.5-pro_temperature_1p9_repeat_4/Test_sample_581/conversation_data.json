    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition of a Cap Set:** The problem asks about the size of a \"cap set\" in dimension 8. A cap set in the vector space $(\\mathbb{F}_3)^n = (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ is a subset of points such that no three distinct points lie on a line. Algebraically, a set $C \\subset (\\mathbb{F}_3)^n$ is a cap set if for any three distinct vectors $x, y, z \\in C$, we have $x + y + z \\neq 0$. The question asks for the best known lower bound for the maximum possible size of a cap set in dimension $n=8$. This maximum size is denoted by $r_3(8)$. A lower bound for $r_3(8)$ is established by constructing a cap set of a certain size.\n\n2.  **Recall Known Values for Smaller Dimensions:** To find a lower bound for $r_3(8)$, we can use known results for smaller dimensions. The exact values for $r_3(n)$ for small $n$ are:\n    *   $r_3(1) = 2$\n    *   $r_3(2) = 4$\n    *   $r_3(3) = 9$\n    *   $r_3(4) = 20$\n    *   $r_3(5) = 45$\n    *   $r_3(6) = 112$\n\n3.  **Use the Product Construction to Get an Initial Lower Bound:** A simple way to construct a cap set in a higher dimension is the product construction. If $C_k$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{F}_3)^k$ and $C_m$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{F}_3)^m$, then their Cartesian product $C_k \\times C_m$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{F}_3)^{k+m}$. The size of this new cap is $|C_k| \\times |C_m|$. This gives us a lower bound: $r_3(k+m) \\ge r_3(k) \\times r_3(m)$.\n\n    Let's apply this to find a lower bound for $r_3(8)$:\n    *   Using $n=8=4+4$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(4) \\times r_3(4) = 20 \\times 20 = 400$.\n    *   Using $n=8=5+3$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(5) \\times r_3(3) = 45 \\times 9 = 405$.\n    *   Using $n=8=6+2$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(6) \\times r_3(2) = 112 \\times 4 = 448$.\n\n    From these simple constructions, the best lower bound we get is 448.\n\n4.  **Check for More Advanced, State-of-the-Art Results:** The cap set problem is an active area of research, and often specific, intricate constructions (frequently found via computer search) can outperform the general product construction. We need to check the recent literature for the best-known result for $n=8$.\n\n5.  **Identify the Record Lower Bound:** Before 2017, the bound of 448 was indeed the best known. However, in a 2017 paper titled \"A new lower bound for the size of a cap in AG(8,3)\", the mathematician Yves Edel presented a new construction. Through a dedicated computer search, he constructed a cap set in $(\\mathbb{F}_3)^8$ of size 496. This discovery established a new, better lower bound. Thus, the best known lower bound for $r_3(8)$ is 496.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 224: This is a lower bound for $r_3(7)$ ($=r_3(6)\\times r_3(1)=112\\times 2$). It's too small for $n=8$.\n    *   B. 16: This is $4^2$. $r_3(4) = 20 > 16$. It is not a relevant value for $n=8$.\n    *   C. 512: This is a plausible number, but it is not a *known lower bound*. The current record is 496. If a cap of size 512 were found, that would become the new lower bound. No such cap has been found.\n    *   D. 80: This is $r_3(4)\\times r_3(2) = 20 \\times 4$, which is a lower bound for $r_3(6)$.\n    *   E. 45: This is the exact value of $r_3(5)$.\n    *   F. 496: This matches the current record for the best-known lower bound for $r_3(8)$, established by Yves Edel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 496.\n\n<<<F>>>"
