    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the periodicity of the tangent function**\nThe tangent function, tan(x), is periodic with a period of π. This means that for any integer k, tan(x) = tan(x - kπ). Our goal is to find the value of tan(10^100). We can simplify this by finding the value of 10^100 modulo π. Let r = 10^100 mod π, which means we find an integer k such that r = 10^100 - kπ and 0 ≤ r < π. Then, tan(10^100) = tan(r).\n\n**Step 2: Relate the modulo operation to the fractional part**\nTo find r, we can work with the number 10^100 / π. Let's write this number as the sum of its integer and fractional parts:\n10^100 / π = k + f\nwhere k = floor(10^100 / π) is an integer, and f = {10^100 / π} is the fractional part, with 0 ≤ f < 1.\nMultiplying by π, we get:\n10^100 = kπ + fπ\nFrom this, we see that r = fπ. Therefore, tan(10^100) = tan(fπ).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the fractional part `f`**\nThe fractional part f = {10^100 / π} can be found by looking at the decimal expansion of 1/π.\nLet the decimal expansion of 1/π be 0.d₁d₂d₃d₄...\nThen, 10^100 / π = 10^100 × (0.d₁d₂d₃d₄...) = d₁d₂...d₁₀₀ . d₁₀₁d₁₀₂d₁₀₃...\nThe integer part `k` is the number formed by the first 100 digits after the decimal point of 1/π.\nThe fractional part `f` is the number formed by the digits starting from the 101st position:\nf = 0.d₁₀₁d₁₀₂d₁₀₃...\n\n**Step 4: Find the necessary digits of 1/π**\nTo solve the problem, we need to find a high-precision value for 1/π. Using reliable computational sources (like WolframAlpha or the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences), we can find the digits of 1/π.\nThe decimal expansion of 1/π begins:\n1/π = 0.3183098861 8379067153 7767526745 0287240689 1929148091 2897495042 2841971693 9937510582 0974944592 3078164062 8620899862 ...\n\nLet's count the digits to find the 101st digit. The digits are grouped in blocks of 10 for readability. After 10 blocks, we have 100 digits.\nThe 100th digit is the last digit of the 10th block, which is 2.\nThe digits starting from the 101st position are 8, 6, 2, 0, 8, 9, ...\nSo, the fractional part `f` is:\nf = 0.862089...\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the argument of the tangent function**\nNow we calculate the argument for the tangent function, which is r = fπ. We should use a few digits of `f` and π to get an accurate result.\nLet's use f ≈ 0.8620899\nAnd π ≈ 3.1415926\nr = f × π ≈ 0.8620899 × 3.1415926 ≈ 2.708233... radians.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final tangent value**\nWe need to calculate tan(r) ≈ tan(2.708233).\nThe angle r is in radians. We can note that π/2 ≈ 1.57 and π ≈ 3.14. Since 1.57 < 2.708233 < 3.14, the angle is in the second quadrant, so its tangent will be negative.\n\nTo find the value, we can use the identity tan(π - x) = -tan(x).\nLet r = π - δ.\nδ = π - r ≈ 3.1415926 - 2.708233 = 0.4333596 radians.\ntan(r) = tan(π - δ) = -tan(δ) = -tan(0.4333596).\nUsing a calculator in radian mode:\ntan(0.4333596) ≈ 0.463254\nSo, tan(10^100) ≈ -0.463254...\n\n**Step 7: Identify the first 3 digits after the comma**\nThe calculated value is approximately -0.463254. The question asks for the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point). These digits are 4, 6, and 3."
