    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined as follows:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate the definite integral `V`:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is a special form. We can solve this integral using a u-substitution.\nLet `u = F₃(x)`.\nThen, the differential `du` is `du = F₃'(x) dx`.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral, we get:\n`∫ (1/u) du`\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the integral**\n\nThe antiderivative of `1/u` is `ln|u|`. Substituting back `u = F₃(x)`, the antiderivative of the original expression is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\nFirst, let's find the value of `F₃(x)` at the lower limit, `x = 0`:\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))`\n*   Since `sin(0) = 0`, we have `e^(sin(0)) = e⁰ = 1`.\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n\nNext, let's find the value of `F₃(x)` at the upper limit, `x = 1`:\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n    *(Here, 1 is in radians)*\n\n**Step 5: Check the domain and sign of F₃(x)**\n\nFor `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `0 ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1)`.\nThis means `e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1`.\nTherefore, `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2`.\nThe natural logarithm `ln(y)` is positive for `y > 1`. Since `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2`, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`.\nSo, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the value of V**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` into the equation for `V`:\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can write this as:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using a calculator (ensure it's in radian mode):\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31977792`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31977792`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(3.31977792) ≈ 1.20000451`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n*   `V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)) ≈ ln(1.20000451 / 0.69314718)`\n*   `V ≈ ln(1.73126034)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.5488603`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final requested value**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5488603 = 5488.603`\n\nThe closest integer to `5488.603` is `5489`.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
