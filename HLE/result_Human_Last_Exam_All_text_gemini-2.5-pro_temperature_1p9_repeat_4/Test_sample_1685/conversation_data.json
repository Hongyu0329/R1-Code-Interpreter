    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for large x:**\n    The given third-order non-linear ODE is:\n    $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n    with initial conditions $y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 3$, $y''(0) = 2$.\n\n2.  **Initial Behavior:**\n    Let's evaluate the initial derivatives.\n    $y(0)=0, y'(0)=3, y''(0)=2$.\n    The initial slope and curvature are positive, which means the function $y(x)$ starts to increase from $x=0$.\n    $y'''(0) = y(0)^4 + y'(0)^4 - \\frac{y''(0)}{3(0)^2+2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0)+1} = 0^4 + 3^4 - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{1} = 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$.\n    The high positive value of $y'''(0)$ suggests a very rapid growth from the start.\n\n3.  **Asymptotic Approximation for Large y:**\n    As $y(x)$ and its derivatives grow, the non-linear terms $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ are expected to become dominant.\n    Let's analyze the other terms for large $x$:\n    *   $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$: If $y''$ does not grow exceedingly fast (e.g., faster than $x^2$), this term will tend to zero as $x \\to \\infty$. Given the likely dominance of other terms, this term can be considered negligible.\n    *   $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$: This term oscillates and is bounded (mostly between 0 and 1, except for singularities at $\\tan(x)=-1$). When $y$ becomes large, this term will be negligible compared to $y^4$ and $(y')^4$.\n\n    Therefore, for large values of the solution, the ODE can be approximated by:\n    $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$\n\n4.  **Dominant Balance Analysis:**\n    We seek a solution for this simplified ODE. A common approach is to look for a solution that has a finite-time singularity, of the form $y(x) = A(x_0 - x)^{-\\alpha}$. Let's test this form.\n    The derivatives are:\n    $y'(x) = A\\alpha(x_0 - x)^{-\\alpha-1}$\n    $y''(x) = A\\alpha(\\alpha+1)(x_0 - x)^{-\\alpha-2}$\n    $y'''(x) = A\\alpha(\\alpha+1)(\\alpha+2)(x_0 - x)^{-\\alpha-3}$\n\n    Let's compare the two terms on the right-hand side of the approximate ODE:\n    $y^4 = A^4(x_0-x)^{-4\\alpha}$\n    $(y')^4 = A^4\\alpha^4(x_0-x)^{-4\\alpha-4}$\n    As $x \\to x_0$, $(x_0-x) \\to 0$. For a blow-up solution, we need $\\alpha > 0$. In this case, the exponent $-4\\alpha-4$ is more negative than $-4\\alpha$. Thus, $(y')^4$ is the dominant term on the right-hand side.\n    The approximate ODE further simplifies to:\n    $y''' \\approx (y')^4$\n\n5.  **Solving the Simplified Asymptotic ODE:**\n    Let $v = y'$. The equation becomes $v'' \\approx v^4$.\n    This is an autonomous equation. We solve it by letting $p = v' = dv/dx$, so $v'' = p(dp/dv)$.\n    $p \\frac{dp}{dv} = v^4 \\implies p dp = v^4 dv$\n    Integrating gives $\\frac{p^2}{2} = \\frac{v^5}{5} + C_1$. For large $v$, the integration constant $C_1$ becomes negligible.\n    $\\frac{(v')^2}{2} \\approx \\frac{v^5}{5} \\implies v' \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} v^{5/2}$\n    This is a separable equation for $v(x)$:\n    $\\frac{dv}{v^{5/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} dx$\n    Integrating yields $\\frac{v^{-3/2}}{-3/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} (x-x_0)$, where $x_0$ is another integration constant.\n    $v^{-3/2} = -\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} (x-x_0)$.\n    $v(x) = y'(x) \\approx \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} (x-x_0)\\right)^{-2/3} = \\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^{-1/3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3} = \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^{-1/3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$.\n    So, $y'(x) \\approx (\\frac{10}{9})^{1/3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$.\n    We can verify this form is self-consistent by substituting it back into $y''' = (y')^4$. Differentiating twice and substituting gives an identity if we set the coefficient of $y'$ as $C=(\\frac{10}{9})^{1/3}$.\n\n6.  **Finding the Expression for y(x):**\n    We integrate $y'(x)$ to find the asymptotic form of $y(x)$:\n    $y(x) = \\int y'(x) dx \\approx \\int C(x_0-x)^{-2/3} dx = C \\frac{(x_0-x)^{1/3}}{1/3}(-1) + D = -3C(x_0-x)^{1/3} + D$.\n    where $D$ is the final integration constant.\n    Substituting $C = (10/9)^{1/3}$:\n    The coefficient of the term $(x_0-x)^{1/3}$ is $-3C = -3(\\frac{10}{9})^{1/3} = -3\\frac{10^{1/3}}{9^{1/3}} = -3\\frac{10^{1/3}}{(3^2)^{1/3}} = -3^{1/3} \\cdot 10^{1/3} = -(30)^{1/3}$.\n    So, the asymptotic solution has the form:\n    $y(x) \\approx D - \\sqrt[3]{30} (x_0 - x)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Determining the final expression:**\n    The constants $x_0$ and $D$ depend on the initial conditions and cannot be determined without a full numerical integration, as the asymptotic form is not valid at $x=0$.\n    The question, however, asks for a specific \"analytical expression\" and requires rounding to two decimal places, which implies a numerical result. This suggests that the question may be about a specific feature or coefficient of the asymptotic solution that is independent of the initial conditions.\n    The coefficient $A = -\\sqrt[3]{30}$ is such a feature, derived from the fundamental structure of the ODE at the singularity. It describes how the function $y(x)$ approaches its value $D$ at the singularity $x_0$. It's the most robust piece of information we can derive analytically about the large-x (i.e., near-singularity) behavior.\n\n8.  **Calculation and Rounding:**\n    Let's calculate the numerical value of this coefficient.\n    $A = -\\sqrt[3]{30} \\approx -3.10723...$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, we get $-3.11$.\n    It's plausible the question is asking for this characteristic coefficient as \"an analytical expression\". It represents a key part of the solution's form in the specified regime. While it is not the full expression for y(x), it is the main quantitative prediction from the asymptotic analysis."
