    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n1.  **Finite Group (G):** A set with a finite number of elements, an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse elements for every element.\n2.  **Product-Free Set (A):** A subset `A` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all elements `x, y` in `A` (including the case where `x=y`), the product `xy` is not in `A`. In set notation, this is `A \\cap AA = \\emptyset`, where `AA = {xy | x \\in A, y \\in A}`.\n3.  **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** This is a product-free set `A` that cannot be extended by adding any element from `G \\ A`. In other words, if `A` is a maximal product-free set and `A` is a proper subset of another set `B`, then `B` cannot be product-free.\n4.  **Filled Group:** A group `G` is defined as \"filled\" if the union of all its maximum by inclusion product-free sets is equal to the entire group `G`.\n5.  **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. All finite abelian groups and all finite p-groups are nilpotent.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Filled Group\" condition**\n\nLet `G` be any finite group, and let `e` be its identity element.\nLet `\\mathcal{M}` be the collection of all maximum by inclusion product-free sets in `G`.\nThe condition for `G` to be a \"filled group\" is `\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}} A = G`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of Product-Free Sets**\n\nLet's consider the identity element `e`. Can `e` be an element of any product-free set `A`?\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that `e \\in A` for some product-free set `A`.\nAccording to the definition of a product-free set, for any `x, y \\in A`, their product `xy` must not be in `A`.\nLet's choose `x = e` and `y = e`. Both are in `A` by our assumption.\nTheir product is `xy = e \\cdot e = e`.\nThe definition of product-free requires this product, `e`, not to be in `A`.\nThis contradicts our initial assumption that `e \\in A`.\nTherefore, the identity element `e` can never be an element of any product-free set `A`.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the analysis of \"Filled Group\" and Product-Free Sets**\n\n1.  We have established that for any finite group `G`, its identity element `e` is not a member of any product-free set `A`.\n2.  Since `e` is not in any product-free set, it cannot be in any *maximum* product-free set either (as these are just a specific type of product-free set).\n3.  Therefore, the union of all maximum by inclusion product-free sets, `\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}} A`, will be a subset of `G` that does not contain the identity element `e`.\n4.  This means `\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}} A \\subseteq G \\setminus \\{e\\}`.\n5.  For `G` to be a filled group, we require the union to be equal to `G`. However, since the union is missing the element `e` (and `e` is always present in a group), the union can never be equal to `G` (unless `G` itself has no elements, which is not a group).\n6.  `G \\setminus \\{e\\}` is always a proper subset of `G` for any non-trivial group. For the trivial group `G=\\{e\\}`, the only product-free set is the empty set `\\emptyset`, so the union is `\\emptyset`, which is not `G`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on a literal and direct interpretation of the standard definitions provided in the question, no finite group `G` can satisfy the condition of being a \"filled group\". The union of its maximal product-free sets will always be a subset of `G \\setminus \\{e\\}` and can never be equal to `G`.\n\nTherefore, the set of finite filled nilpotent groups is the empty set. There are no such groups."
