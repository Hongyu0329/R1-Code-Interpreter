    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and Edge Squares**\n*   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are the squares on the first and last rows and the first and last columns.\n*   Let's calculate the total number of edge squares:\n    *   The perimeter of the 8x8 board has 4 sides, each with 8 squares. That gives 4 * 8 = 32 squares.\n    *   However, the 4 corner squares are counted twice in this method. So, we subtract the duplicates: 32 - 4 = 28.\n    *   Alternatively: Top row (8) + Bottom row (8) + Left side excluding corners (6) + Right side excluding corners (6) = 28.\n    *   So, there are **28 total edge squares**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Constraints of Placing Bishops**\n*   Bishops move and attack along diagonals.\n*   To place the maximum number of bishops, we must place them so that no two bishops are on the same diagonal.\n*   A crucial point about bishops is that a bishop on a white square can only attack other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other black squares. This means we can analyze the white squares and black squares independently.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Edge Squares by Color**\n*   Let's count how many of the 28 edge squares are white and how many are black.\n*   Each row and column on the edge has 4 white squares and 4 black squares.\n*   The 4 sides have a total of 14 white squares and 14 black squares.\n    *   White edge squares = 14\n    *   Black edge squares = 14\n    *   Total = 14 + 14 = 28. This confirms our count.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\n*   We need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares. This means placing only one bishop on any given diagonal.\n*   Let's identify the white edge squares that share diagonals:\n    *   (a8, h1) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (a6, f1) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (a4, d1) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (a2, b1) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (c8, h3) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (e8, h5) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (g8, h7) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n*   These 7 pairs cover all 14 white edge squares. Since we can only place one bishop per pair, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the white edge squares is **7**.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\n*   We do the same analysis for the 14 black edge squares. Due to the symmetry of the board, the result will be the same, but we can list the pairs for confirmation:\n    *   (a1, h8) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (c1, f8) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (e1, d8) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (g1, b8) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (a3, h6) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (a5, h4) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n    *   (a7, h2) share a diagonal. We can place 1 bishop.\n*   These 7 pairs cover all 14 black edge squares. Therefore, the maximum number of bishops on black edge squares is also **7**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops and Empty Squares**\n*   Total maximum bishops placed = (Max on white squares) + (Max on black squares) = 7 + 7 = **14**.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Total bishops placed)\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = **14**.\n\nThe final answer is the number of edge squares that would be empty after placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
