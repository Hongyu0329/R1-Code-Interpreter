    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Quadratic Field:** A number field of the form `Q(√d)`, where `d` is a square-free integer not equal to 1.\n*   **Imaginary Quadratic Field:** A quadratic field where `d < 0`. These are the fields relevant to the question.\n*   **Fundamental Discriminant (D):** A unique integer that characterizes a quadratic field. A negative fundamental discriminant `D < 0` is one of two forms:\n    1.  `D = d`, where `d` is a square-free integer and `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)`.\n    2.  `D = 4d`, where `d` is a square-free integer and `d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4)`.\n    Each imaginary quadratic field `Q(√d)` is uniquely associated with one negative fundamental discriminant `D`.\n*   **Class Group:** For a quadratic field, the class group is a finite abelian group that measures the extent to which its ring of integers fails to have unique factorization.\n*   **Class Number (h(D)):** The order (size) of the class group for the field with discriminant `D`. A class number of 1 means the field has unique factorization.\n*   **The Gauss Class Number Problem:** This is a collection of problems related to the class number. The specific version asked here is: for a given integer *n*, find all negative fundamental discriminants *D* such that their class number *h(D)* is equal to *n*.\n\n**2. Formulating the Question Mathematically**\n\nThe question asks for the cardinality of the following set:\n`{D < 0 | D is a fundamental discriminant and h(D) = 48}`\n\n**3. Context and Solution History**\n\n*   Gauss himself conjectured that the class number *h(D)* tends to infinity as the absolute value of the discriminant *D* increases (`h(D) -> ∞` as `D -> -∞`).\n*   This conjecture was proven by Hans Heilbronn in 1934. An important consequence of this proof is that for any given class number *n*, there can only be a **finite number** of negative fundamental discriminants *D* with `h(D) = n`.\n*   The problem then became to explicitly find all such discriminants for a given *n*. This is known as the \"class number *n* problem\".\n*   This problem was solved for small *n* over several decades (e.g., *n*=1 was the famous Baker-Heegner-Stark theorem).\n*   For larger *n*, solving the problem requires advanced theory and significant computational power. The work of Goldfeld, Gross, and Zagier in the 1980s provided an effective, though very large, bound for the discriminants for any given class number. This made it possible, in principle, to find all discriminants by a finite (but massive) search.\n\n**4. Finding the Solution for Class Number 48**\n\n*   Solving the class number 48 problem is not a simple calculation. It relies on the results of a comprehensive research project.\n*   The definitive work on this topic for class numbers up to 100 was completed by **Mark Watkins** in his PhD thesis and subsequent publications around 2004-2007.\n*   Watkins used the theoretical bounds from Goldfeld-Gross-Zagier and performed extensive, rigorous computer searches to find and verify the complete list of all fundamental discriminants for each class number *h* ≤ 100.\n*   The results are published in academic journals (e.g., *Mathematics of Computation*) and are considered the definitive solution to the problem in this range.\n*   By consulting the tables compiled by Watkins, we can find the count for *h* = 48.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fundamental Discriminant:** The question specifically asks for *fundamental* discriminants. This is the standard in this problem, as each quadratic field corresponds to exactly one fundamental discriminant.\n2.  **Negative Discriminants:** The problem is about *negative* discriminants, which correspond to *imaginary* quadratic fields. The class number problem for positive discriminants (real quadratic fields) is a much harder, largely unsolved problem.\n3.  **Non-triviality of the Solution:** It's crucial to understand that this is not a result one can derive from a simple formula. It is the culmination of deep mathematical theory and extensive computation.\n4.  **Authoritative Source:** The answer relies on accepting the results of specialized mathematical research. For class numbers up to 100, the work of M. Watkins is the standard and accepted authority.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the research outlined above:\n1.  The class number problem for *h*=48 is to find the size of the set of negative fundamental discriminants *D* for which *h(D)*=48.\n2.  We know this set is finite.\n3.  The complete enumeration for class numbers up to 100 has been done by Mark Watkins.\n4.  In his published tables of results, the count for class number 48 is listed.\n5.  This number is **199**.\n\nThis means there are exactly 199 imaginary quadratic fields whose ideal class group has order 48.\n\n<<<199>>>"
