To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its physical shape. When the sun rises and exposes the table to UV light, it should mechanically transform from a relatively straight configuration (representing the stable *trans*-isomer) into a bent configuration (representing the *cis*-isomer). When the sun sets and it becomes dark, the table must relax back to its original straight (*trans*) configuration.
