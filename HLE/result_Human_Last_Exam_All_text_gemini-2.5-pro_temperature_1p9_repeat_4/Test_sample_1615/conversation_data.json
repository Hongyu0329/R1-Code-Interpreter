    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   We are given a graph $G$.\n    *   The number of vertices is $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is stipulated to be \"other than the complete graph\". This means $G$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n    *   The question asks for the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of $G$ properly\". This is asking for the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n    *   Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be the family of all simple graphs with 12345 vertices that are not a complete graph. The question is asking to find $\\max_{G \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\{\\chi(G)\\}$.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number:**\n    *   The chromatic number of any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is always less than or equal to $n$. That is, $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent, so each vertex requires a unique color.\n    *   In this problem, $n = 12345$, and the graph $G$ is explicitly stated to *not* be the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that $\\chi(G)$ must be strictly less than $n$. So, $\\chi(G) < 12345$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    *   **A more formal proof for the upper bound:** Since $G \\neq K_n$, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not adjacent. Because they are not connected, we can assign them the same color in a proper vertex coloring. We can devise a coloring scheme using at most $n-1$ colors:\n        1.  Assign `color 1` to both $u$ and $v$.\n        2.  For the remaining $n-2$ vertices, assign each one a unique new color from `color 2` to `color n-1`.\n        This coloring uses $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors in total. It is a proper coloring because no two adjacent vertices share a color. Thus, for any graph $G \\neq K_n$, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n-1$.\n    *   Applying this to our specific case, where $n = 12345$, the maximum number of colors cannot exceed $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n3.  **Show that the Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   To confirm that 12344 is the maximum possible value, we need to construct a graph $G$ that satisfies the given conditions (12345 vertices, not a complete graph) and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344.\n    *   Consider the graph $G$ formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and a single isolated vertex, $K_1$. Let's denote this as $G = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$.\n    *   **Check the conditions for G:**\n        *   **Number of vertices:** The total number of vertices is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. This matches the requirement.\n        *   **Is it a complete graph?** No. For $G$ to be $K_{12345}$, every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. In our constructed $G$, the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the 12344 vertices in the other component. So, $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n    *   **Calculate the chromatic number of G:**\n        *   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n        *   The first component is $K_{12344}$. A complete graph on $k$ vertices requires $k$ colors. So, $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n        *   The second component is $K_1$ (an isolated vertex), which requires only one color. So, $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n        *   The chromatic number of $G$ is therefore $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that any graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most 12344 colors.\n    *   We have also provided a concrete example of such a graph that requires exactly 12344 colors.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344. The mention of \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" in the problem statement is a property of any graph, and our analysis holds for any valid $\\Delta(G)$. In our example graph, $\\Delta(G)=12343$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{12344}$."
