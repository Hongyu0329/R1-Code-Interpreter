    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are considering a graph G with a vertex set V, where |V| = 128.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). A clique of size k is a complete graph with k vertices, denoted as $K_k$.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** An induced subgraph on a vertex subset S is the graph formed by S and all the edges of the original graph that connect two vertices in S.\n*   **A clique size k appearing as an induced subgraph:** This means there exists a set of k vertices, say S, in the graph G such that the subgraph induced by S is a complete graph $K_k$. This is the standard definition of a clique in a graph.\n*   **Number of different clique sizes:** We are looking for a single graph G that contains induced cliques of various sizes $k_1, k_2, ..., k_m$. The goal is to maximize m, the number of these distinct sizes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between different clique sizes within a single graph**\n\nLet's say a graph G has an induced clique of size k. This means there is a set of k vertices, let's call it $V_k$, such that every vertex in $V_k$ is connected to every other vertex in $V_k$.\n\nNow, let's consider any integer $j$ such that $1 \\le j < k$. Can we find an induced clique of size $j$ in the same graph G?\n\nYes, we can. We can simply choose any subset of $j$ vertices from our existing set $V_k$. Let's call this new subset $V_j$. Since all vertices in the larger set $V_k$ are mutually connected, it must be true that all vertices in its subset $V_j$ are also mutually connected. Therefore, the subgraph induced by $V_j$ is a complete graph of size $j$, i.e., a $K_j$.\n\nThis leads to a crucial insight: **If a graph contains an induced clique of size k, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to k.**\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the set of possible clique sizes**\n\nFrom the conclusion in Step 2, the set of all possible clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in any given graph G is not just any collection of numbers. It must be a set of consecutive integers starting from 1.\nSo, the set of clique sizes is always of the form $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, K\\}$.\n\nThe number K is the size of the largest clique that exists in the graph G. This is a fundamental property of a graph, known as its **clique number**, and is often denoted by $\\omega(G)$.\n\nSo, for any graph G, the number of different clique sizes it can contain is exactly its clique number, $\\omega(G)$.\n\n**Step 4: Re-frame the question based on the analysis**\n\nThe original question asks for the \"maximum possible number of different clique sizes\". Based on our analysis, this is equivalent to finding the \"maximum possible clique number $\\omega(G)$\" for a graph G with n=128 vertices.\n\n**Step 5: Solve the simplified question**\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $\\omega(G)$ for a graph G with 128 vertices.\n\n*   By definition, a clique is a subset of the vertices of the graph. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with 128 vertices, the clique number $\\omega(G)$ can be at most 128.\n*   We need to check if this maximum value of 128 is achievable. Is there a graph G with 128 vertices that has a clique of size 128?\n*   Yes, there is: the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as $K_{128}$. In this graph, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, so the entire set of vertices forms a clique of size 128. Thus, $\\omega(K_{128}) = 128$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final answer**\n\n1.  The maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n2.  The number of different clique sizes in a graph is equal to its clique number.\n3.  Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n4.  This maximum is achieved by the complete graph $K_{128}$, which contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nFinal Check: A potential misunderstanding could be to assume the vertex sets for the different cliques must be disjoint. This would lead to a problem of partitioning 128 into the sum of distinct integers (e.g., $1+2+3+...+m \\le 128$, which gives $m=15$). However, the problem statement does not impose this disjointness constraint. The wording \"simultaneously appear\" means they exist in the same graph, not that they are disjoint. Therefore, the simple and direct interpretation is the correct one.\n\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
