    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence to identify the heptad repeat.**\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state. These positions form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil and are typically occupied by nonpolar residues. The `e` and `g` positions are often charged or polar and form salt bridges between helices.\n\nThe given sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nTo find the correct registration, we look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues (`I`, `L`, `A`, `W`) that could correspond to the `a` and `d` positions. These positions are spaced by two residues (`a-b-c-d`).\n\nLet's test potential registrations. The most consistent and chemically plausible registration assigns the `a` and `d` positions as follows, starting from residue `A(4)`:\n\n*   **Heptad 1:** `A(4) Q(5) S(6) L(7) K(8) E(9) I(10)`\n*   **Heptad 2:** `A(11) K(12) S(13) L(14) K(15) E(16) I(17)`\n*   **Heptad 3:** `A(18) W(19) S(20) L(21) K(22) E(23) I(24)`\n*   **Heptad 4:** `A(25) Q(26) S(27) L(28) K(29) G(30)...`\n\n**Step 2: Identify the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions.**\nBased on the registration above, the core residues are:\n*   **`a` positions:** A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25) -> **Consistently Alanine (A)**\n*   **`d` positions:** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28) -> **Consistently Leucine (L)**\n\nThis registration is highly regular for the core `a` and `d` positions throughout the sequence. The main anomaly is the Tryptophan (`W`) at position 19, which falls into a solvent-exposed `b` position. While energetically unfavorable, it is likely a local perturbation, and the overall oligomeric state will be determined by the dominant `(a=A, d=L)` pattern that spans the entire coiled-coil region.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the packing efficiency of the core residues (\"Knobs-into-Holes\").**\nThe key to the question is how the identified core residues, Alanine at `a` and Leucine at `d`, will pack most efficiently.\n\n*   **Alanine (A)** is a **small** hydrophobic residue.\n*   **Leucine (L)** is a **large**, bulky hydrophobic residue.\n\nWe now evaluate the packing of this `(a=A, d=L)` core in different oligomeric states.\n\n*   **Dimer (2-stranded):** The core packing involves interactions between the `a` position of one helix and the `d` position of the other. Packing a small Alanine `a`-knob into the hole created on the opposing helix would leave a significant cavity. This is energetically unfavorable and leads to inefficient packing. Dimers are most stable when both `a` and `d` are large hydrophobic residues (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine).\n\n*   **Trimer (3-stranded):** The packing geometry in a trimer is different. The core is slightly less constrained than in a dimer. The `a` knobs point towards the central axis of the three-helix bundle. Placing a small residue like Alanine at the `a` position allows for very efficient, clash-free packing. The larger Leucine residues at the `d` positions also pack well into the corresponding holes. The `(a=small, d=large)` pattern, specifically with `a=A` and `d=L`, is a classic signature for a trimeric coiled-coil.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4-stranded) and higher:** These oligomers require highly specific packing arrangements. For example, canonical tetramers often have uniform layers (e.g., a layer of four Isoleucines) or specific alternating patterns (`a=I, d=A`). The heterogeneous `(a=A, d=L)` pattern found in this sequence does not fit well with the packing requirements for a stable tetramer.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the most likely oligomeric state.**\nBased on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency, the combination of a small hydrophobic residue (Alanine) at the `a` positions and a large hydrophobic residue (Leucine) at the `d` positions is most favorably accommodated by a trimeric structure. This arrangement minimizes empty space in the core and avoids the steric hindrance that larger residues might cause.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein sequence is expected to be a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
