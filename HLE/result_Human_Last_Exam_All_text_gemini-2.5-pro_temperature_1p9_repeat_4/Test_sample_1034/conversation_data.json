    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup and the Condition**\n\nWe are given a triangle $A B C$ with the following information:\n*   Side $B C = S$. Let's denote side lengths as $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$. So, $a = S$.\n*   Angle $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B=30^{\\circ}$.\n*   We are looking for the number of integer values of side $b = AC$.\n*   The key condition is that there are **two possible values for the side length $c = AB$**.\n\nThis is the classic \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (SSA condition). For a given angle, its adjacent side, and its opposite side, there can be zero, one, or two possible triangles. We are explicitly told there are two.\n\n**Step 2: Derive the Condition for Two Possible Triangles**\n\nWe can derive the condition for the length of side $b = AC$ using either the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines. Let's use the Law of Cosines as it directly involves the side length $c = AB$.\n\nApplying the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle ABC$ with respect to angle $B$:\n$b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \\cos(B)$\n\nSubstitute the known values ($a = S$, $B=30^\\circ$):\n$b^2 = S^2 + c^2 - 2(S)(c) \\cos(30^\\circ)$\n$b^2 = S^2 + c^2 - 2Sc \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$\n$b^2 = S^2 + c^2 - S\\sqrt{3}c$\n\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic equation form for the variable $c$ (which is the length of side $AB$):\n$c^2 - (S\\sqrt{3})c + (S^2 - b^2) = 0$\n\nFor there to be two possible values for the side length $c = AB$, this quadratic equation in $c$ must have two distinct, positive, real roots.\n\n1.  **Distinct Real Roots**: The discriminant ($\\Delta$) must be positive.\n    $\\Delta = (-(S\\sqrt{3}))^2 - 4(1)(S^2 - b^2) > 0$\n    $3S^2 - 4(S^2 - b^2) > 0$\n    $3S^2 - 4S^2 + 4b^2 > 0$\n    $4b^2 - S^2 > 0$\n    $4b^2 > S^2$\n    Since $b$ and $S$ are side lengths, they are positive. So, $2b > S$, which means $b > \\frac{S}{2}$.\n\n2.  **Positive Real Roots**: The product of the roots must be positive. (The sum of the roots is $S\\sqrt{3}$, which is already positive, so if the product is positive, both roots must be positive).\n    Product of roots = $c_1 c_2 = S^2 - b^2 > 0$\n    $S^2 > b^2$\n    Since $b$ and $S$ are positive, $S > b$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the side length $b = AC$ must be in the range:\n$\\frac{S}{2} < b < S$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Value of S**\n\nThe problem states, \"Let $S=S N Y W R$\". This is a placeholder for a numerical value. In such problems, if no external context (like a previous problem's answer) is provided, the value of $S$ is often inferred from the problem statement itself. The numerical values given in the problem are $30$ (from the angle) and \"two\" (from the number of possible values). It is most plausible that the side length $S$ is intended to be $S=30$.\n\nLet's assume $S=30$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Number of Integer Values for AC**\n\nUsing $S=30$ in the inequality we derived:\n$\\frac{30}{2} < b < 30$\n$15 < b < 30$\n\nWe need to find the number of integers for $b$ (which is the length of $AC$) in this interval. The integers are:\n$16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29$.\n\nTo count them, we can use the formula: Last - First + 1.\nNumber of integers = $29 - 16 + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14$.\n\nTherefore, there are 14 possible integer values for the side length $AC$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Ambiguous Case (SSA):** The problem is a direct application of the ambiguous case in trigonometry. Recognizing this is the first crucial step.\n2.  **Deriving the Condition:** The condition $a \\sin B < b < a$ (in our notation, $S \\sin(30^\\circ) < b < S$) is the standard textbook condition. Deriving it from the Law of Cosines, by requiring two distinct positive roots for the unknown side, is a robust method that confirms the result.\n3.  **Placeholder Variable:** The variable $S=SNYWR$ cannot be left abstract. A logical assumption must be made about its value. Taking the only significant number from the problem statement, $30$, is a standard approach for contest-style problems of this nature.\n4.  **Counting Integers:** When counting integers in an open interval $(x, y)$, the smallest integer is $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1$ and the largest is $\\lceil y \\rceil - 1$. For the interval $(15, 30)$, the integers range from $16$ to $29$. It is easy to make an off-by-one error in counting.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Condition for two possible values for side $AB$: $\\frac{S}{2} < AC < S$.\n*   Assume $S=30$.\n*   Inequality for $AC$: $15 < AC < 30$.\n*   The integer values for $AC$ are $\\{16, 17, \\dots, 29\\}$.\n*   The total count of these integer values is $29 - 16 + 1 = 14$.\n\n<<<14>>>"
