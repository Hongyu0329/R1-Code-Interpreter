    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the varieties involved**\n\n*   C is a compact Riemann surface of genus $g=3$. Algebraically, this is a smooth projective curve of genus 3 over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   X is the 15th symmetric power of C, denoted $C^{(15)}$. This is the variety whose points correspond to effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n\n**Step 2: Relating the Neron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe Neron-Severi group of a variety Y, denoted $NS(Y)$, is the group of divisors on Y modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, $\\rho(Y)$, is called the Picard number of Y.\n\n1.  **The Abel-Jacobi map:** There is a well-defined map $u: X = C^{(15)} \\to Pic^{15}(C)$, where $Pic^{15}(C)$ is the variety of line bundles of degree 15 on C. This map sends a divisor $D$ to its corresponding line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$.\n2.  **The Jacobian:** The variety $Pic^{15}(C)$ is a principal homogeneous space for the Jacobian of C, $J(C) = Pic^0(C)$. By choosing a base point (e.g., a line bundle $L_0$ of degree 15), we get an isomorphism $Pic^{15}(C) \\cong J(C)$. So, we can consider the map $u$ as going to $J(C)$. $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional abelian variety.\n3.  **Fibration structure:** The map $u: X \\to J(C)$ presents X as a fiber bundle over $J(C)$. The fiber over a line bundle $L \\in J(C)$ is the projective space $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, L))$ of effective divisors corresponding to $L$.\n4.  **Dimension of the fibers:** By the Riemann-Roch theorem, for a line bundle $L$ of degree $d=15$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g=3$, the dimension of the space of global sections is $h^0(C,L) = d - g + 1 + h^1(C,L)$. By Serre duality, $h^1(C,L) = h^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1})$, where $K_C$ is the canonical bundle. The degree of $K_C \\otimes L^{-1}$ is $(2g-2) - d = (2 \\cdot 3 - 2) - 15 = 4 - 15 = -11$. For a general line bundle $L$, this bundle has no sections, so $h^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1})=0$. Thus, for a general $L$, $h^0(C,L) = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\n5.  **Projective bundle structure:** Since $d=15 > 2g-1=5$, the dimension of $H^0(C,L)$ is constant for all $L \\in Pic^{15}(C)$, so $X = C^{(15)}$ is a projective bundle over $J(C)$ with fiber $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\n6.  **Neron-Severi Rank:** For such a projective bundle structure $X \\to J(C)$, the Neron-Severi group of X is related to that of the base. Specifically, we have an isomorphism of $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces:\n    $NS(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong (NS(J(C)) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Q} \\cdot \\xi$\n    where $\\xi$ is the class of a divisor that restricts to a hyperplane on each fiber. This gives a simple relation for the ranks:\n    $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nOur problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ as C ranges over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the minimum possible rank of $\\rho(J(C))$**\n\n1.  The Neron-Severi rank $\\rho(A)$ of an abelian variety A is the dimension of the $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space of Hodge classes, $H^{1,1}(A, \\mathbb{C}) \\cap H^2(A, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n2.  For a *very general* curve C of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms, i.e., $\\text{End}(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  In this case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is also minimal. The only algebraic classes in $H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Z})$ are integer multiples of the canonical principal polarization class, $\\theta$.\n4.  Therefore, for a very general genus 3 curve C, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n5.  This gives the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n    $\\rho(X)_{min} = \\rho(J(C))_{min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the maximum possible rank of $\\rho(J(C))$**\n\n1.  The Neron-Severi rank of an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A) = \\dim H^{1,1}(A, \\mathbb{C})$. For $A=J(C)$, $g=3$, we have $h^{1,1}(J(C))=g^2=3^2=9$. So, $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$.\n2.  To achieve a large Neron-Severi rank, the curve C must be special, meaning its Jacobian $J(C)$ has extra endomorphisms (more than just $\\mathbb{Z}$). This occurs for curves with automorphisms or whose Jacobians are isogenous to products of lower-dimensional abelian varieties (e.g., elliptic curves).\n3.  Consider the Fermat quartic curve, $F_4$, given by the equation $x^4+y^4=1$. This is a smooth curve of genus $g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$.\n4.  The Jacobian $J(F_4)$ is a special abelian variety. It is known to be isogenous to the product $E \\times E \\times E = E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve with equation $y^2 = x^3 - x$.\n5.  The elliptic curve $E$ has Complex Multiplication (CM) by the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Its endomorphism ring $\\text{End}(E) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has rank 2 as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module.\n6.  An isogeny preserves the rank of the Neron-Severi group. So we can compute $\\rho(E^3)$.\n7.  For a product of abelian varieties $A_1 \\times \\dots \\times A_n$, the Neron-Severi rank is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho(\\prod A_i) = \\sum_i \\rho(A_i) + \\sum_{i<j} \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\text{Hom}(A_i, A_j)$\n8.  Applying this to $A = E^3$ (i.e., $A_1=A_2=A_3=E$):\n    *   For any elliptic curve, $\\rho(E)=1$.\n    *   $\\text{rank Hom}(E, E) = \\text{rank End}(E) = \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}[i]) = 2$.\n    *   There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs of $(E_i, E_j)$ with $i < j$.\n    $\\rho(E^3) = \\rho(E) + \\rho(E) + \\rho(E) + \\text{rank Hom}(E,E) + \\text{rank Hom}(E,E) + \\text{rank Hom}(E,E)$\n    $\\rho(E^3) = (3 \\times 1) + (3 \\times 2) = 3 + 6 = 9$.\n9.  This shows that $\\rho(J(F_4))=9$, which meets the theoretical maximum of $g^2$.\n10. This gives the largest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n    $\\rho(X)_{max} = \\rho(J(C))_{max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is 2, achieved when C is a very general curve.\n*   The largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is 10, achieved when C is a curve whose Jacobian has maximal Neron-Severi rank (e.g., the Fermat quartic curve).\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
