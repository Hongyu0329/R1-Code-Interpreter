    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate**: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The specific stereochemistry (1S, 2R) is crucial. For 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes, an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration corresponds to the *cis* isomer.\n*   **Reagent**: Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$) in tert-butyl alcohol. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically bulky (non-nucleophilic) base.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Most Stable Conformation of the Substrate**\n*   For cyclohexane rings, reactions are best understood by drawing the chair conformations.\n*   The substrate is a *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. It can exist in two interconverting chair conformations:\n    1.  Conformer A: Bromine (Br) is axial and the methyl ($CH_3$) group is equatorial.\n    2.  Conformer B: Bromine (Br) is equatorial and the methyl ($CH_3$) group is axial.\n*   To determine which conformer is more stable, we consider the A-values (a measure of steric strain for an axial substituent). The A-value for a methyl group (~1.7 kcal/mol) is significantly larger than that for a bromine atom (~0.5 kcal/mol).\n*   Therefore, the molecule will predominantly exist in the conformation that places the bulkier methyl group in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain. This is **Conformer A (Br axial, $CH_3$ equatorial)**. The reaction will proceed from this more stable and abundant conformer.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereoelectronic Requirement for the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 elimination mechanism requires a specific spatial arrangement: the leaving group (Br) and the beta-hydrogen (Î²-H, a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be **anti-periplanar**. In a cyclohexane chair, this means they must both be in **axial positions** on adjacent carbons (a diaxial arrangement).\n*   In the reactive conformation (Conformer A), the leaving group, Bromine, is already in an **axial** position, which is perfect for an E2 reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Available Beta-Hydrogens for Elimination**\n*   We need to look for axial hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to C1, which are C2 and C6.\n*   **At Carbon-2 (C2)**: This carbon has an equatorial methyl group. Therefore, the hydrogen atom on C2 must be in the **axial** position. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. Elimination using this hydrogen is possible.\n*   **At Carbon-6 (C6)**: This carbon has two hydrogen atoms, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial** hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. Elimination using this hydrogen is also possible.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Products and Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity)**\n*   Since there are two different beta-hydrogens that can be eliminated, two different products can be formed.\n    *   **Zaitsev Pathway**: If the base removes the axial hydrogen from C2, the double bond forms between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (trisubstituted) and thermodynamically more stable alkene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **Hofmann Pathway**: If the base removes the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond forms between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) and thermodynamically less stable alkene (the Hofmann product).\n*   The regioselectivity (which product is major) is determined by the nature of the base.\n*   Potassium tert-butoxide is a **very bulky base**. Due to its large size, it has difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons.\n*   Comparing the two available axial protons:\n    *   The proton on C2 is sterically hindered by the nearby equatorial methyl group.\n    *   The proton on C6 is much less sterically hindered and more accessible to the bulky base.\n*   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially remove the more accessible proton from C6. This leads to the formation of the Hofmann product as the major product.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with the bulky base potassium tert-butoxide proceeds via an E2 mechanism. Both Zaitsev and Hofmann elimination pathways are stereoelectronically allowed, but the bulky base favors the abstraction of the sterically least hindered proton (on C6), leading to the formation of the Hofmann product as the major product.\n\nThe name of the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
