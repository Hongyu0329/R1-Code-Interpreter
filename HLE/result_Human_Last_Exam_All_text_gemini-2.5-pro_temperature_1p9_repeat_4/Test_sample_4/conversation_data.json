    "An elegant step-by-step method to solve this problem is to decompose the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ and then use known results about the Poincaré polynomials of its components.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional with basis $e_1, \\ldots, e_6$ and the non-zero commutation relations are:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nAll other brackets between basis elements are zero. Let's examine the structure of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\text{span}(e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4)$. The brackets within this subspace are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$ and $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$. All other brackets are zero. This is a well-known 4-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra, the standard filiform Lie algebra of dimension 4.\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\text{span}(e_1, e_5, e_6)$. The only non-zero bracket within this subspace is $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.\n\nNotice that $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ are both subalgebras of $\\mathfrak{g}$. Their intersection is the 1-dimensional subalgebra $\\mathfrak{k} = \\text{span}(e_1)$. The whole algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the sum of these two subalgebras: $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{g}_1 + \\mathfrak{g}_2$.\nFurthermore, the brackets between elements of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and \"pure\" elements of $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ (i.e., those not in $\\mathfrak{k}$) are:\n$[e_2, e_5] = 0, [e_2, e_6] = 0$\n$[e_3, e_5] = 0, [e_3, e_6] = 0$\n$[e_4, e_5] = 0, [e_4, e_6] = 0$\nThis structure means that $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the amalgamated sum (or fiber product) of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ over their common subalgebra $\\mathfrak{k}$. This is written as $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{g}_1 \\oplus_{\\mathfrak{k}} \\mathfrak{g}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the property of the Poincaré polynomial for amalgamated sums**\n\nFor Lie algebras (over a field of characteristic 0), the cohomology algebra of an amalgamated sum is the tensor product of the cohomology algebras over the cohomology of the common subalgebra.\n$H^*(\\mathfrak{g}) \\cong H^*(\\mathfrak{g}_1) \\otimes_{H^*(\\mathfrak{k})} H^*(\\mathfrak{g}_2)$\nThis relation at the level of cohomology algebras translates to a simple formula for their Poincaré polynomials (which are the Hilbert-Poincaré series of these graded algebras):\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P_{\\mathfrak{k}}(x)}$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Poincaré polynomials of the components**\n\n1.  **For $\\mathfrak{k} = \\text{span}(e_1)$:**\n    $\\mathfrak{k}$ is a 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra. Its Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{k}}(x) = 1+x$.\n\n2.  **For $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\text{span}(e_1, e_5, e_6)$ (Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$):**\n    The cochain complex is $(\\bigwedge(e^1, e^5, e^6), d)$ with $de^1=0, de^5=0, de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\n    The Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}_2)$ are:\n    $b_0 = 1$.\n    $H^1(\\mathfrak{g}_2)$: Cocycles are $e^1, e^5$. So $b_1 = 2$.\n    $H^2(\\mathfrak{g}_2)$: Cocycles are $e^1 \\wedge e^6, e^5 \\wedge e^6$. The only boundary is $e^1 \\wedge e^5$. So $b_2=2$.\n    $H^3(\\mathfrak{g}_2)$: The top form $e^1 \\wedge e^5 \\wedge e^6$ is a cocycle. There are no boundaries. So $b_3=1$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n    This can be factored as $(1+x)(1+x+x^2)$.\n\n3.  **For $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\text{span}(e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4)$ (Filiform 4D algebra):**\n    The cochain complex is $(\\bigwedge(e^1, e^2, e^3, e^4), d)$ with $de^1=0, de^2=0, de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2, de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\n    The Betti numbers are known to be:\n    $b_0 = 1$.\n    $H^1(\\mathfrak{g}_1)$: Cocycles are $e^1, e^2$. $b_1 = 2$.\n    $H^2(\\mathfrak{g}_1)$: Cocycles basis: $[e^1 \\wedge e^4], [e^2 \\wedge e^3]$. $b_2=2$.\n    $H^3(\\mathfrak{g}_1)$: Cocycles basis: $[e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^4], [e^1 \\wedge e^3 \\wedge e^4]$. $b_3=2$.\n    $H^4(\\mathfrak{g}_1)$: Top form is a cocycle. $b_4=1$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the final Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$**\n\nNow we substitute the component polynomials into the formula:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1+x}$\nUsing the factorization $1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3 = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1+x)(1+x+x^2)}{1+x}$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)(1+x+x^2)$\n\nNow, we perform the polynomial multiplication:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + x \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + x^2 \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + (x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n\nGroup terms by powers of $x$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (2+2+1)x^2 + (2+2+2)x^3 + (1+2+2)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThis polynomial satisfies Poincaré duality for a 6-dimensional Lie algebra ($b_k = b_{6-k}$), which provides a good consistency check.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n$b_0 = 1, b_6 = 1$\n$b_1 = 3, b_5 = 3$\n$b_2 = 5, b_4 = 5$\n$b_3 = 6$\nThe coefficients are symmetric.\n\nThe final result is the polynomial in the variable $x$.\n\n<<<1+3*x+5*x^2+6*x^3+5*x^4+3*x^5+x^6>>>"
