    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Kanji 謄.**\nThe character 謄 is a complex kanji. We first examine its overall structure to identify its main components. It has a clear left-right structure (左右構造, sayū kōzō).\n*   The component on the left is: 言\n*   The component on the right is: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (部首, bushu).**\nIn kanji with a left-right structure, the component on the left is very often the radical, which indicates the general meaning or category of the character. This type of radical is called a \"hen\" (偏). In the case of 謄, the left-side component 言 is indeed its radical. The right side, 朕, primarily serves as the phonetic component.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of the radical.**\nNow we need to find the specific name for the radical 言 when it's positioned on the left side of a character.\n*   The radical itself is the character 言.\n*   The Japanese name for a radical often combines its reading with its position.\n*   The reading of 言 used for radical names is its Go-on reading, \"gon\" (ごん).\n*   The name for a radical on the left side is \"hen\" (へん), which is often voiced to \"ben\" (べん) in compound words for easier pronunciation.\n*   Combining these, the name becomes \"gon\" + \"ben\" = \"Gonben\" (ごんべん).\n\n**Step 4: Confirm with the provided example and formatting.**\nThe user provided the example: for the character 媛, the answer is \"Onnahen\".\n*   In 媛, the radical is 女 (onna), and it is on the left side (hen). This perfectly matches the \"Onnahen\" naming convention.\n*   Our finding for 謄 is that the radical is 言 (gon) and it is on the left side (ben, the voiced form of hen). The name \"Gonben\" follows this same pattern. The final answer should be the Hepburn transcription of this name.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe radical of the character 謄 is 言, which is located on the left side. Its name in Japanese is ごんべん, which is transcribed in Hepburn as \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
