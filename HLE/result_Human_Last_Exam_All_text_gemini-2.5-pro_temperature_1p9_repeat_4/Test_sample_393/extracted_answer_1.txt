Let $c_j$ be the number of parts $a_i$ of a given size $s_j$. The number of Tverberg partitions is given by the formula for the number of partitions of a set of $n$ elements into parts of specified sizes $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r$. This number is the multinomial coefficient, which counts ordered partitions, divided by the product of factorials of the counts of identical part sizes. The formula is $\frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \dots a_r! \prod_{j} c_j!}$.
