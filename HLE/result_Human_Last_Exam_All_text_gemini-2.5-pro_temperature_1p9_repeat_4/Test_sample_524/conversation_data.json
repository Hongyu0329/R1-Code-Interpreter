    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terms\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms in the question: \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\"\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a metric space that is both **compact** and **connected**. Examples include a closed interval [0,1], a square, a disk, and a sphere.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means there is a homeomorphism from the space to a subset of the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h from X to itself (an automorphism) such that h(x) = y. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point. For instance, you can't distinguish one point on a circle from another topologically.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are asked for the number of homeomorphism classes, not the number of specific sets. Two spaces are in the same homeomorphism class if one can be continuously deformed into the other (stretched, bent, but not torn or glued). For example, a circle and a square are in the same homeomorphism class.\n\nSo, the question is: How many fundamentally different topological shapes are there that are compact, connected, can be drawn in the plane without self-intersection, and look the same from every point?\n\n### Step 2: Considering Degenerate vs. Non-Degenerate Cases\n\nIt's useful to separate the problem into two cases based on the number of points in the continuum.\n\n*   **Degenerate Continuum:** A continuum consisting of a single point.\n*   **Non-Degenerate Continuum:** A continuum consisting of more than one point.\n\nLet's analyze the degenerate case first.\n*   A single point, `{p}\\_ is compact and connected, so it is a continuum.\n*   It is planar (it's a subset of $R^2$).\n*   It is homogeneous: for any two points x, y in `{p}\\_ we must have x = y = p. The identity map is a homeomorphism that maps x to y.\nTherefore, **the point is one homogeneous planar continuum.** All single-point spaces are homeomorphic, so this represents one class.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Non-Degenerate Cases and the Classification Theorem\n\nNow we consider the non-degenerate cases. This is a very deep and classic problem in point-set topology. The complete classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua is a major result, achieved through the work of R. H. Bing, F. Burton Jones, James T. Rogers, Jr., and others over several decades.\n\nThe classification theorem states that **every non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of exactly three spaces.**\n\nLet's list and describe these three spaces:\n\n1.  **The Circle ($S^1$):**\n    *   **Description:** The familiar shape of a simple closed curve.\n    *   **Properties:** It is compact, connected, and planar. It is homogeneous because any point can be rotated to any other point. It is also the only one of the non-degenerate examples that is **locally connected**. This property provides a clear topological distinction from the others.\n\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   **Description:** This is a famous \"pathological\" but important continuum. It can be visualized as an infinitely crooked, snake-like curve that is so tangled that it contains no topological arcs (no subspace homeomorphic to a line segment).\n    *   **Properties:** It is compact, connected, and planar. A non-trivial theorem by R. H. Bing shows it is homogeneous. It is fundamentally different from the circle because it is **not** locally connected. A key property is that it is **indecomposable**, meaning it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   **Description:** This space can be conceptualized as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle. It is a \"circle-like\" continuum.\n    *   **Properties:** It is compact, connected, planar, and homogeneous. Like the pseudo-arc, it is **not** locally connected, which distinguishes it from the circle. However, unlike the pseudo-arc, it is **decomposable** (it is not indecomposable). This property distinguishes it from the pseudo-arc.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nWe have identified all possible homeomorphism classes based on the established classification theorem. Let's list them to get the final count.\n\n1.  **The Point** (the only degenerate case)\n2.  **The Circle** (the only locally connected non-degenerate case)\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** (the indecomposable, non-locally connected case)\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs** (the decomposable, non-locally connected case)\n\nThese four spaces are topologically distinct, and the classification theorem guarantees that this list is complete. Therefore, there are exactly four such homeomorphism classes."
