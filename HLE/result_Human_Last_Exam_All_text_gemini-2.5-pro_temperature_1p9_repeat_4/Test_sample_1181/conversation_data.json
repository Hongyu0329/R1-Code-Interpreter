    "Step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core elements of the question:**\n    *   **Source:** The 1972 film \"Solaris\" by Andrei Tarkovsky. This is important because the film's themes and character portrayals differ from the original Stanislaw Lem novel.\n    *   **Action/Emotion:** A character is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This identifies a very specific feeling: not just simple nostalgia, but a sense of shame associated with it, suggesting a conflict between the character's duty as a scientist/explorer and their fundamental human desires.\n    *   **Task:** Identify which character expresses this sentiment.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the answer choices based on character analysis from the film:**\n\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist. The film famously begins and ends with him in a dacha surrounded by lush nature, including trees and rustling leaves. While he is deeply connected to Earth, his primary emotional conflict on the station revolves around his deceased wife, Hari, and his guilt. He is the *subject* of nature, but not the one who voices this specific shameful longing.\n\n    *   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"guest\" or simulacrum created by the Solaris ocean based on Kris's memories of his wife. She has no real, independent memories of Earth. Her journey is about discovering her own consciousness, not about missing a world she never truly knew.\n\n    *   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is depicted as world-weary, cynical, and prone to philosophical musings, often with a drink in hand. Having been isolated on the station for a long time, he has had ample time to reflect on his separation from humanity and Earth. This confession of a deep, sensory-based homesickness, coupled with a feeling of shame (as if it's a weakness for a scientist on the frontier), fits his character perfectly. In a conversation with Kris, Snaut makes this very confession, lamenting that his mind is so saturated by the station that he can barely recall such a simple, beautiful earthly sound.\n\n    *   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is the other surviving scientist. He is cold, clinical, and fiercely dedicated to the scientific method. He views the \"guests\" as objects of study and is contemptuous of the emotional turmoil they cause. A vulnerable confession about missing a sound from Earth would be entirely out of character for him.\n\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who commits suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches his final video message. While Gibarian expresses despair and warns Kris, he does not have a direct conversation where he could express this specific sentiment.\n\n3.  **Conclusion from the analysis:**\n    The character who has been worn down by his long tour on the station and confesses to Kris his shame at having forgotten something as fundamental as the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. It is a poignant moment that highlights the psychological toll of their mission and their profound disconnection from their home world.\n\n<<<C>>>"
