    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Space**\nThe space of $k$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. For this problem, we are considering the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, which is $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nA key property of Grassmannians is the diffeomorphism $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cong G_{n-k}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, which maps a $k$-dimensional subspace to its $(n-k)$-dimensional orthogonal complement.\nIn our case, this means $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5) \\cong G_{5-3}(\\mathbb{R}^5) = G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. Working with $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is often simpler.\n\nThe object we need to analyze is the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. We are interested in its torsion subgroup.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Rank of the Torsion Subgroup\"**\nLet $R = H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i \\ge 0} H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. This is a graded ring, and as a group, it is a direct sum of abelian groups.\nThe torsion subgroup of an abelian group $A$, denoted $T(A)$, consists of all elements of finite order.\nThe torsion subgroup of the ring $R$ is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of its components: $T(R) = \\bigoplus_{i \\ge 0} T(H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\nThe **rank** of a finitely generated abelian group $A$ is a fundamental invariant. By the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, $A$ can be decomposed as $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$, where $r$ is a non-negative integer and $T$ is a finite group (the torsion subgroup). The number $r$ is the rank of $A$. Equivalently, the rank of $A$ is the dimension of the rational vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup, $T(R)$. Let this group be denoted by $G_{torsion}$. By its very definition, every element in $G_{torsion}$ has a finite order. Such a group is called a torsion group.\n\nFor any torsion group $G_{torsion}$, its rank is always 0. This is because for any element $g \\in G_{torsion}$ and any rational number $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the element $g \\otimes q$ in the tensor product $G_{torsion} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is zero. Let $n$ be the order of $g$, so $ng=0$. Then $g \\otimes q = g \\otimes (n \\frac{q}{n}) = (ng) \\otimes \\frac{q}{n} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{q}{n} = 0$. Thus, $G_{torsion} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q} = \\{0\\}$, and its dimension is 0.\n\nSo, based on the standard definition of rank, the answer must be 0, provided that the torsion subgroup is indeed a torsion group (which it is by definition).\nThe non-trivial part of the problem is to first confirm that the integral cohomology ring indeed has a non-trivial torsion subgroup. If there were no torsion, the torsion subgroup would be the trivial group $\\{0\\}$, which also has rank 0. To be thorough, we determine the structure of this torsion subgroup.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Additive Structure of the Integral Cohomology Ring**\nThe calculation of the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is a classic but non-trivial result in algebraic topology. The structure has been fully determined. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the additive structure of its integral cohomology groups is as follows (for example, see G. I. Salagean, \"Integral cohomology of real Grassmann manifolds\", 2011):\n\n*   $H^0(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$. (The dimension of $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is $2 \\times (5-2) = 6$).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Torsion Subgroup**\nThe torsion subgroup of each cohomology group $H^i$ is its subgroup of finite order elements.\n*   $T(H^0) = \\{0\\}$ since $H^0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ is torsion-free.\n*   $T(H^1) = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $T(H^2) = H^2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $T(H^3) = H^3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $T(H^4) = H^4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $T(H^5) = H^5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $T(H^6) = \\{0\\}$ since $H^6 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ is torsion-free.\n*   $T(H^i) = \\{0\\}$ for $i>6$.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring $R = H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of these torsion subgroups:\n$T(R) = T(H^0) \\oplus T(H^1) \\oplus T(H^2) \\oplus T(H^3) \\oplus T(H^4) \\oplus T(H^5) \\oplus T(H^6) \\oplus \\dots$\n$T(R) = \\{0\\} \\oplus \\{0\\} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\{0\\} \\oplus \\dots$\nAs an abelian group, $T(R) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\nThis shows that the space has a non-trivial torsion subgroup.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Rank**\nThe final step is to find the rank of the abelian group $T(R) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\nAs established in Step 2, the rank of any torsion group is 0. Since $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$ is a torsion group (every element has order 1 or 2), its rank is 0.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n1.  The space $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is the same as $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ up to diffeomorphism.\n2.  The question is about the \"rank\" of the \"torsion subgroup\". It's crucial to use the standard definition of rank for an abelian group, which is the rank of its free part.\n3.  A torsion group, by definition, has no non-trivial free part, so its rank is 0.\n4.  The main work is to determine if the integral cohomology has torsion at all. Using known results, we find that the torsion subgroup is substantial, isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n5.  Despite the non-trivial nature of the torsion subgroup, its rank, by standard definition, is 0. A different interpretation of \"rank\" (like the minimum number of generators, which would be 4) would be non-standard in this context.\n\nThe question requires computing the structure of the torsion subgroup and then applying the precise definition of rank. The structure shows there's something to talk about, and the definition provides the final answer.\n\n<<<0>>>"
