    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** *Irritator challengeri*, a species of spinosaurid dinosaur.\n    *   **Anatomical Feature:** The \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone in the skull that is situated in front of the eye socket. A recess is a depression or indentation in the bone, often associated with pneumaticity (air sacs).\n    *   **Specific Inquiry:** The exact number of \"depressions\" contained *within* this lacrimal recess.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points & Required Information:**\n    *   This is a highly specific anatomical question that cannot be answered with general knowledge. It requires information from primary scientific literature describing the fossil of *Irritator challengeri*.\n    *   The holotype specimen, a nearly complete skull cataloged as SMNS 58022, is the definitive source for this information.\n    *   We need to find the scientific papers that describe the cranial anatomy of this specific specimen. Key papers would be the initial detailed description and any subsequent re-evaluations, especially those using modern techniques like CT scanning.\n    *   Terminology can be a careful point. \"Depressions,\" \"subsidiary fossae,\" \"subsidiary openings,\" or \"foramina\" might be used interchangeably in different papers to describe the same features. The key is to find the description of the main lacrimal recess and how it is subdivided.\n\n3.  **Acquire and Analyze Scientific Data:**\n    *   **Primary Source:** The most comprehensive initial description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Darren M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n    *   **Analysis of Sues et al. (2002):** In their description of the lacrimal bone, the authors state: \"A large lacrimal pneumatic recess with **three** subsidiary depressions pierces the body of the bone just below the dorsal margin of the antorbital fenestra...\" This paper explicitly identifies three depressions within the main recess.\n    *   **Verification with Recent Research:** To confirm this finding and ensure it hasn't been revised, we look for more recent studies. A 2023 paper by Marco Schade and colleagues, titled \"A re-appraisal of the cranial and mandibular osteology of the spinosaurid Irritator challengeri,\" provides a new, highly detailed look at the holotype skull using CT scans.\n    *   **Analysis of Schade et al. (2023):** This recent and technologically advanced re-examination confirms the earlier observation. The authors describe the feature as follows: \"...a large, posteriorly positioned lacrimal pneumatic recess...which subdivides into **three** smaller, subsidiary openings...\"\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Finalize the Answer:**\n    *   Both the foundational scientific description from 2002 and the most recent, detailed re-appraisal from 2023 are in agreement.\n    *   They both document that the large pneumatic recess on the lacrimal bone of *Irritator challengeri* is subdivided into three smaller features, referred to as \"subsidiary depressions\" or \"subsidiary openings.\"\n    *   Therefore, the lacrimal recess contains three depressions.\n\n<<<3>>>"
