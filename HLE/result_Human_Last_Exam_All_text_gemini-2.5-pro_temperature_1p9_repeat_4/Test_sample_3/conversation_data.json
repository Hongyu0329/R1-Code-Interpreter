    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\nWe are considering elliptic curves $E$ defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The set of points on such a curve with coordinates in $K$, denoted $E(K)$, forms a finitely generated abelian group by the Mordell-Weil theorem. This group has a torsion part, $E(K)_{tors}$, which is a finite abelian group.\nThe question asks for the largest possible order of $E(K)_{tors}$, given that the group is non-cyclic. A finite abelian group is non-cyclic if it is not of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for some integer $n$. Any torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve must be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_2 | n_1$. For the group to be non-cyclic, we must have $n_2 > 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the classification of torsion subgroups over number fields\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields are highly constrained. For a given degree of the number field, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=d$, there is a uniform bound on the order of the torsion subgroup (Merel's theorem). For quadratic fields ($d=2$), the possible torsion subgroups have been completely classified through the work of Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and others.\n\n### Step 3: Consult the specific classification for quadratic fields\nWe need the complete list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve defined over *any* quadratic field. These are:\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n2.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n4.  $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n5.  $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Refine the list for the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, which contains the 3rd and 6th roots of unity. This property is important as it allows for certain torsion structures. The existence of a specific torsion subgroup over a particular quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ depends on the existence of rational points on certain modular curves over that field. Recent literature in the field, such as surveys by F. Najman, provides precise lists of which torsion groups occur for specific quadratic fields like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nLet's check each non-cyclic possibility for its existence over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n\n1.  **Groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$**: It has been established that all these groups for $n=1, \\dots, 6$ occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    - For $n=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, order 4.\n    - For $n=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, order 8.\n    - For $n=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, order 12.\n    - For $n=4$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, order 16.\n    - For $n=5$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$, order 20.\n    - For $n=6$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, order 24.\n    The largest order in this family is 24.\n\n2.  **Groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3n\\mathbb{Z}$**: These occur for $n=1,2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. In fact, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (for $n=2$) occurs *only* over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ among quadratic fields.\n    - For $n=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, order 9.\n    - For $n=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, order 18.\n    The largest order in this family is 18.\n\n3.  **Group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$**: This group occurs as a torsion subgroup over a quadratic field only for $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$. It does not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Its order is 16.\n\n4.  **Group $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$**: This group occurs as a torsion subgroup over a quadratic field only for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. It does not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Its order is 25.\n\n5.  **Group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$**: This group is known to occur as a torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a quadratic field *only* for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Its order is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the orders and find the maximum\nNow, we list the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n- From the first family: {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24}. Maximum is 24.\n- From the second family: {9, 18}. Maximum is 18.\n- The special case $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 36.\n\nComparing the maximum orders from all possible families: $\\max(24, 18, 36) = 36$.\n\nThus, the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 36."
