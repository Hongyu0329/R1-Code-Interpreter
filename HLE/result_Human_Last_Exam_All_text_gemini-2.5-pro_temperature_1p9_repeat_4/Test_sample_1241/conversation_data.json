    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain defined by the Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations. The steady-state probabilities, denoted as $P_i(+\\infty)$ or simply $P_i$, are the limiting values of $P_i(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. In the steady state, the system is in equilibrium, which means the probabilities are constant and their time derivatives are zero.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the steady-state equations.**\nTo find the steady-state probabilities $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, we set the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero in the given system of differential equations.\n\nThe given system is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nand the normalization condition:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nThe given rates are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008\n$$\n\nSetting the derivatives to zero, we get the following system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$:\n1.  $-0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1 = 0$\n2.  $0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n3.  $0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 = 0$\n4.  $0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\n**Careful Point:** The first four equations derived from the derivatives are linearly dependent. We will use three of them along with the normalization equation (5) to solve for the probabilities. The simplest equations are typically the best choice.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the system of linear equations.**\nLet's simplify the equations:\n1.  $-0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1 = 0$\n2.  $0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n3.  $0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2 = 0$\n4.  $0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$\n\nCombining these results, we get a key simplification:\n$P_1 = P_2 = P_3$\n\nNow, use equation (1) to express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$0.65 P_1 = 0.019 P_0 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\n**Step 3: Use the normalization condition to find the probabilities.**\nWe now have all probabilities ($P_0, P_2, P_3$) expressed in terms of $P_1$. We substitute these into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n\nFactor out $P_1$:\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n\nTo solve for $P_1$, we find a common denominator:\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**Careful Point:** It is best to keep this value as a fraction to avoid rounding errors in intermediate steps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.**\nThe question asks for $P_0 + P_1$. We use the relationship $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$ that we found earlier.\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1\\right) + P_1$\nFactor out $P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 \\right)$\n$P_0 + P_1 = P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019} \\right)$\n$P_0 + P_1 = P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\right)$\n\nNow substitute the expression for $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.707} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\right)$\n\nThe term $0.019$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, which simplifies the calculation significantly:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$P_0 + P_1 \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get approximately 0.9463.\n\nFinal Answer is the calculated value of the expression $\\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
