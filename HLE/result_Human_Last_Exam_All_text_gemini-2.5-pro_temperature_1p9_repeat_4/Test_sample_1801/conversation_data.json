    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe user is asking to identify two specific individuals who meet the following criteria:\n1.  They are Nobel laureates.\n2.  They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  The commercial aired in or around the year 2000.\n4.  The commercial was part of a campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n5.  The commercial is now considered \"infamous.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Ask Why\" Campaign\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron in 2000. Its goal was to rebrand Enron from a simple energy company to an innovative, high-tech, ideas-driven corporation that was creating new markets for things like bandwidth and weather derivatives. To lend intellectual credibility to this image, Enron hired several prominent thinkers and academics to appear in their commercials.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Potential Nobel Laureates\nThe most prominent academics featured in the television commercials for this campaign were **Paul Krugman** and **George Akerlof**. We need to verify if they are indeed Nobel laureates.\n*   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity.\n*   **George Akerlof:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 (along with Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz) for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information.\n\nBoth individuals are Nobel laureates, satisfying the first criterion.\n\n### Step 4: List the Careful Points and Address Nuances\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Timing of the Nobel Prize.** This is the most important detail. When the commercials aired in 2000, neither Krugman nor Akerlof was a Nobel laureate. George Akerlof won his prize the very next year, in 2001. Paul Krugman won his prize several years later, in 2008. The question asks for \"Nobel laureates,\" which they both are now, making them the correct answer. It is a common misconception that they were already laureates at the time.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Why the Commercials are \"Infamous\".** The ads became infamous in hindsight. Enron collapsed in a massive accounting fraud scandal in late 2001. The fact that these brilliant economists (one of whom won the Nobel prize for work on asymmetric information, the very problem at the heart of the Enron scandal) had lent their credibility to the company became a source of great irony and embarrassment. Paul Krugman, in particular, has publicly expressed his regret for participating.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Content of their Commercials.** In his ad, Krugman discussed the commodification of bandwidth. Akerlof's ad touched upon his Nobel-winning theory of \"lemons\" (asymmetric information in markets), discussing how good ideas can drive out bad ones.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize the Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who fit all the criteria of the question are Paul Krugman and George Akerlof. They are Nobel laureates who appeared in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign, even though they had not yet received their prizes when the ads were filmed.\n\n***\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials were **Paul Krugman** and **George Akerlof**.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and George Akerlof>>>"
