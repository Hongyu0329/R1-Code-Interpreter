    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943), a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician. He was a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) and served as Foreign Minister in the Russian Provisional Government of 1917.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Claim:** The question states that Milyukov \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time\" and denounced \"X-Ys\" as a \"stagnant swamp\". This presents a seeming contradiction that needs careful handling.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Milyukov was a political \"Westernizer\" (Zapadnik), meaning he admired Western political systems like constitutional monarchies and liberal democracies and wanted Russia to follow a similar path.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** However, his political Westernism did not extend to his cultural and aesthetic tastes. In matters of art, music, and literature, Milyukov was a traditionalist and a conservative. He was highly critical of the modernist and avant-garde movements that emerged in Europe and Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n3.  **Trace the Quote:** The key to finding \"X-Y\" is the specific phrase \"'stagnant swamp'\" (*stoyachee boloto* in Russian). We need to find the context in which Milyukov used this phrase.\n    *   Historical sources, particularly in the field of Russian music history (e.g., Richard Taruskin's work on Stravinsky), document Milyukov's activities as a critic.\n    *   Milyukov used his influential newspaper, *Rech* (\"Speech\"), as a platform for his cultural criticism.\n\n4.  **Identify the Target:** Milyukov's criticism was directed at a specific forum for artistic modernism in St. Petersburg.\n    *   This forum was a series of concerts called the **\"Evenings of Contemporary Music\"** (in Russian: *Vechera sovremennoi muzyki*).\n    *   These concerts, organized between 1901 and 1912, were a crucial venue for showcasing new, radical compositions by both Russian modernists (like Scriabin, the young Prokofiev, and Stravinsky) and their Western European counterparts (like Debussy and Ravel).\n\n5.  **Connect the Quote to the Target:** In a review published in *Rech*, Milyukov famously attacked the \"Evenings of Contemporary Music\". He described the circle of composers and performers associated with these events as a \"'stagnant swamp' of musical amateurism and decadent mysticism.\"\n\n6.  **Determine \"X-Y\":** The question uses the format \"X-Y\" to refer to what Milyukov denounced. While the full name of the organization was the \"Evenings of Contemporary Music,\" the movement and genre it represented was, simply, **Contemporary Music**. Milyukov was railing against this new wave of modern music which he found to be decadent and a departure from classical traditions. Therefore, the most fitting answer for \"X-Y\" is the genre/movement itself.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Pavel Milyukov:** A political liberal but a cultural conservative.\n*   **Target of Criticism:** Not Western culture as a whole, but the modernist artistic movements within it.\n*   **Specific Phrase:** \"'stagnant swamp'\".\n*   **Context:** A review of the \"Evenings of Contemporary Music\" concert series.\n*   **What was showcased?** The new, modernist, \"Contemporary Music\".\n*   **Conclusion for X-Y:** Contemporary Music.\n\n<<<Contemporary Music>>>"
