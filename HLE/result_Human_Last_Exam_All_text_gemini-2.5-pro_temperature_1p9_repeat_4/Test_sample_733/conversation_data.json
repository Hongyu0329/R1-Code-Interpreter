    "Answering this question requires us to identify all finite groups `G` that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n### Step 1: Define the terms\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of `G` is product-free if for all `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), the product `xy` is not in `S`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set (MPS):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. Equivalently, for any element `g` in `G \\ S`, the set `S U {g}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **Set of Size 2:** We are looking for groups `G` that have an MPS `S` where `|S| = 2`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the conditions for an MPS of size 2\n\nLet `G` be a finite group and `S = {a, b}` be a subset of `G` with two distinct elements, `a` and `b`.\n\n1.  **S must be product-free.** This implies that the following products cannot be in `S`:\n    *   `a * a = a² ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `b * b = b² ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `a * b ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `b * a ∉ {a, b}`\n    This also means that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`, because if `a=e`, then `a*a = e*e = e = a`, which is in `S`. So `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`.\n\n2.  **S must be maximal.** This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S U {g} = {a, b, g}` is not product-free. Since `S` itself is product-free, this failure must involve `g`. This means that for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of the following must be true:\n    *   A product of elements from `S` equals `g`: `g = a²` or `g = b²` or `g = ab` or `g = ba`.\n    *   A product involving `g` equals an element of `S`: e.g., `ag = a` (impossible as `g≠e`), `ag=b`, `ga=b`, `g²=a`, etc.\n    *   A product involving `g` equals `g`: e.g., `ag=g` (impossible as `a≠e`), `g²=g` (`g=e`). The identity `e` is always in this category of \"failure-causing\" elements, since for `g=e`, the set `S U {e}` is not product-free because `ae=a`.\n\nThis leads to a characterization: `S={a,b}` is an MPS if and only if it is product-free and for every `g ∈ G \\ S`, `g` is a \"failure-causing element\". The set of all failure-causing elements, let's call it `K(S)`, can be expressed in terms of `a` and `b`:\n`K(S) = {e, a², b², ab, ba, a⁻¹b, b⁻¹a, ba⁻¹, ab⁻¹} U {g ∈ G | g²=a} U {g ∈ G | g²=b}`.\nThe maximality condition then becomes `G \\ S ⊆ K(S)`.\n\nThe problem is thus equivalent to finding all finite groups `G` for which there exists a pair of elements `{a, b}` satisfying these properties, which essentially implies that the entire group `G` can be \"built\" from `a` and `b` in this specific way.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the groups\n\nThis classification problem has been studied in combinatorial group theory. Solving it from first principles is complex and involves case-by-case analysis for groups of small orders and different structures. We will rely on the established mathematical literature.\n\nThe classification was initiated by A. P. Street and W. D. Wallis and has been confirmed in subsequent works. The finite groups that contain a maximal product-free set of size 2 are:\n\n1.  **Z₄**: The cyclic group of order 4. An example of such a set is `{x, x³}` where `x` is a generator.\n2.  **Z₂ × Z₂** (also called `V₄`): The Klein four-group. An example is `{a, b}` where `a, b` are two distinct non-identity elements.\n3.  **Z₅**: The cyclic group of order 5. An example is `{x, x⁴}` where `x` is a generator.\n4.  **Z₆**: The cyclic group of order 6. An example is `{x², x³}` where `x` is a generator.\n5.  **Z₇**: The cyclic group of order 7. An example is `{x, x³}` where `x` is a generator.\n6.  **Z₂ × Z₄**: An abelian group of order 8.\n7.  **Z₉**: The cyclic group of order 9.\n8.  **Dic₃** (also denoted `Q₁₂`): The dicyclic group of order 12, with presentation `<x, y | x⁶=1, y²=x³, y⁻¹xy=x⁻¹>`.\n\nThese are 8 distinct (non-isomorphic) groups.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nWe have listed all the non-isomorphic finite groups that satisfy the given condition. Counting them gives the final answer.\nThe list is: `Z₄`, `Z₂ × Z₂`, `Z₅`, `Z₆`, `Z₇`, `Z₂ × Z₄`, `Z₉`, `Dic₃`.\nThere are 8 such groups.\n\n<<<8>>>"
