    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the question and constraints.**\nThe core of the problem is to solve a riddle presented as a haiku. The final answer must be a list of words, derived from the haiku, placed in alphabetical order.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   The title, \"The Bays\", is explicitly stated to be a question.\n*   The haiku provides three clues, one in each line.\n*   The final answer must be alphabetized.\n*   The poem is a haiku, meaning its syllable structure (5-7-5) might be a confirming detail, but is most likely a constraint on the riddle's creator.\n\n**Step 2: Decode the title.**\nThe title \"The Bays\" is a homophone. When spoken, it sounds identical to \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\". The task is to find three words starting with the letter 'B' from the clues in the haiku.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the first line of the haiku.**\n*   **Line:** \"An August tempest\" (Syllables: An-Au-gust-tem-pest = 5)\n*   **Analysis:** This line points towards a historical figure. Napoleon **Bonaparte** was born in August (1769). His life and political career were incredibly disruptive and chaotic, accurately described as a \"tempest\" that swept across Europe. He was also an emperor, a figure who could be described with the adjective \"august,\" meaning majestic and inspiring reverence.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first 'B' word is **Bonaparte**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the second line of the haiku.**\n*   **Line:** \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" (Syllables: Twice-fif-teen-brings-winds-of-change = 7)\n*   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. The mention of \"winds\" points to a scale for measuring wind speed, specifically the Beaufort scale. On this scale, a wind speed of 28-33 knots is categorized as a Force 7, which is called a \"strong **breeze**\".\n*   **Conclusion:** The second 'B' word is **Breeze**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the third line of the haiku.**\n*   **Line:** \"A divine one yields\" (Syllables: A-di-vine-one-yields = 5)\n*   **Analysis:** This clue is from the world of computing. The binary system, which is fundamental to all modern electronics, uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The creation of complex systems from this simple \"one\" can be described as almost \"divine\" in its power. The most basic unit of information in this system, represented by a single 0 or 1, is called a **bit**. Thus, \"a divine one yields\" a bit.\n*   **Conclusion:** The third 'B' word is **Bit**.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble and order the final answer.**\n*   **The B's identified:** Bonaparte, Breeze, Bit.\n*   **Instruction:** The question asks for the answer in alphabetical order.\n*   **Alphabetical Order:** Bit, Bonaparte, Breeze.\n\n<<<Bit, Bonaparte, Breeze>>>"
