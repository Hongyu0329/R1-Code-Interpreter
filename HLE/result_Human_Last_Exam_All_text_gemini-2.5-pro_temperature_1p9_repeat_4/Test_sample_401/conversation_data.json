    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the definitions involved and a key distinction between metric and non-metric spaces.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected Hausdorff topological space. Note that it is not required to be metric.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is called indecomposable if it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a closed and connected subset, and \"proper\" means it is not equal to the entire space `X`.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point `p` in a continuum `X`, its composant, `C_p`, is the set of all points `x` in `X` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. The collection of all composants of `X` forms a partition of `X` (i.e., they are disjoint and their union is `X`).\n\n### Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound on the Number of Composants\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory connects the concept of decomposability to composants:\n\n*   **Theorem:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if and only if at least one of its composants is the entire space `X`.\n\nFrom this theorem, we can deduce the property of an indecomposable continuum:\n\n*   For an **indecomposable** continuum, no single composant can be the entire space. Every composant must be a proper subset of `X`.\n*   Since the composants form a partition of `X` (their union is `X`), and no single composant can be `X`, there must be more than one composant.\n*   Therefore, any indecomposable continuum must have at least **two** composants. This establishes a lower bound of 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the \"Not Necessarily Metric\" Clause\n\nThis clause is the most critical part of the question, as the answer is different for metric versus general Hausdorff continua.\n\n*   **Case 1: Metric Indecomposable Continua**\n    If an indecomposable continuum is metric (i.e., its topology comes from a metric), a much stronger result holds. Using the Baire Category Theorem, one can prove that every composant is a \"meager\" set (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets). Since a complete metric space (like a compact metric space) cannot be meager in itself, it cannot be a countable union of its composants. This forces any metric indecomposable continuum to have an **uncountable** number of composants.\n\n*   **Case 2: General (Non-Metric) Indecomposable Continua**\n    The argument used for the metric case fails for general non-metric continua. This is because a composant in a non-metric space is not necessarily a meager set. A composant is a union of proper subcontinua (which are nowhere-dense), but this union may be uncountable, and an uncountable union of nowhere-dense sets is not necessarily meager. This opens the possibility for an indecomposable continuum to have a small, finite number of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Minimum Value\n\nWe have established a lower bound of 2. The question now is whether this lower bound can be achieved. Is it possible for an indecomposable continuum to have exactly two composants?\n\n*   The answer is **yes**. While impossible in the metric setting, the existence of such a space in the general non-metric setting has been proven.\n*   In 1974, the mathematician David P. Bellamy constructed an example of a non-metric indecomposable continuum that has **exactly two** composants.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant, so the minimum number is at least 2.\n2.  The existence of a non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants has been established.\n3.  Combining these two facts, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
