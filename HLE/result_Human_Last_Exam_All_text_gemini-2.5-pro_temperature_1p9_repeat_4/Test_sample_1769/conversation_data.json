    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the likely Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Origin of the Current Word \"Sister\"**\nThe Modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Old English word *sweostor*. However, its current form, particularly the 'i' vowel sound (/ɪ/), is a direct result of influence from the Old Norse word *systir*. The Scandinavian invaders (Norsemen or Vikings) brought their language to England, and in areas of intense settlement (the Danelaw), Old Norse and Old English mixed. This resulted in the Norse *systir* blending with and eventually modifying the native Old English word into the form we use today.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Purely Native Old English Word**\nTo predict what the word would have become without Norse contact, we must start with the original, uninfluenced Old English word. The primary literary form in Old English (specifically, the West-Saxon dialect) was *sweostor*. There was also a common non-West-Saxon dialectal form, *swuster*. These forms are related to other West Germanic words like German *Schwester* and Dutch *zuster*.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Native Word's Development into Middle English**\nLanguages are constantly changing. We need to follow the likely path of the Old English word into Middle English (c. 1150-1450). Historical evidence from texts of this period shows that the most widespread native form of the word was not one derived from *sweostor*, but rather **suster**, which evolved from the dialectal Old English form *swuster*. The initial \"sw-\" often simplified to \"s-\" before a rounded vowel like \"u\". For centuries, *suster* was the most common native English term, existing alongside the Norse-influenced *sister*.\n\n**Step-by-step Careful Points:**\n*   **Initial Word Choice:** We must start with the correct Old English ancestor. While *sweostor* was the literary standard, the form *swuster* gave rise to the more common Middle English word *suster*. In a world without Norse influence, it is this common native form that is most likely to have become the standard.\n*   **Competing Forms:** In this hypothetical scenario, there would be no Old Norse *systir* to compete with *suster*. Therefore, *suster* would have been the unchallenged native term.\n\n**Step 4: Project the Word's Evolution from Middle English to Modern English**\nThe final step is to apply the known sound changes that occurred between Middle and Modern English to the word *suster*.\n*   **The Vowel Sound:** The most critical sound change here is the **FOOT-STRUT split**. This major shift in English pronunciation changed the Middle English short vowel /u/ (as in \"put\") into the Modern English /ʌ/ vowel (as in \"strut\", \"cut\", or \"duster\") in the majority of words.\n*   **Applying the Change:** The Middle English word *suster* was pronounced with a short /u/ sound. Under the FOOT-STRUT split, this /u/ would naturally become /ʌ/.\n*   **Consonants and Stress:** The consonants 's', 't', and 'r' would have remained stable, and the stress would remain on the first syllable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFollowing the most common native developmental path and applying standard English sound laws, the Middle English word *suster* would have evolved into a Modern English word pronounced with an /ʌ/ vowel.\n\nTherefore, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **Suster**, rhyming with \"muster\" or \"duster\".\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
