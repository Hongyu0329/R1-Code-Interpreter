    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atom count.**\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of Pople basis set, which is a split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by Gaussian functions. We need to analyze it separately for heavy atoms (Carbon) and for Hydrogen.\n\n*   **A contracted Gaussian function** (or basis function) is a fixed linear combination of one or more primitive Gaussian functions. The question asks for the total number of these contracted functions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the basis set for a single Carbon (C) atom.**\nFor second-row atoms like Carbon, the 6-31G notation is broken down as follows:\n\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The \"6-\" part describes the core electrons. The 1s core orbital is represented by a **single contracted Gaussian function**, which is built from a sum of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   Core functions = 1\n\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"-31\" part describes the valence electrons. This is a \"split-valence\" representation, meaning the valence orbitals are described by two basis functions each.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part (\"-3\"):** The inner, more tightly bound part of the valence shell (one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals: 2px, 2py, 2pz) is represented by one contracted function per orbital. Each of these is built from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   Inner valence s-function = 1\n        *   Inner valence p-functions (px, py, pz) = 3\n        *   Total inner valence functions = 1 + 3 = 4\n    *   **Outer Valence Part (\"-1\"):** The outer, more diffuse part of the valence shell is represented by another set of functions. Each of these is a single uncontracted primitive Gaussian.\n        *   Outer valence s-function = 1\n        *   Outer valence p-functions (px, py, pz) = 3\n        *   Total outer valence functions = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:**\n    *   Total = (Core functions) + (Inner valence functions) + (Outer valence functions)\n    *   Total = 1 + 4 + 4 = **9 contracted Gaussian functions per Carbon atom.**\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to count the 'p' shell as one function. It is composed of three degenerate orbitals (px, py, pz), so it contributes 3 functions to the basis set.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the basis set for a single Hydrogen (H) atom.**\nHydrogen has no core electrons, only a single valence 1s orbital. The notation applies only to the valence shell.\n\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The \"-31\" part describes the split-valence 1s orbital.\n    *   **Inner Part (\"-3\"):** The inner part is represented by **one contracted function** built from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   Inner valence functions = 1\n    *   **Outer Part (\"-1\"):** The outer part is represented by **one uncontracted function** (a single primitive Gaussian).\n        *   Outer valence functions = 1\n\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Total = (Inner valence functions) + (Outer valence functions)\n    *   Total = 1 + 1 = **2 contracted Gaussian functions per Hydrogen atom.**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted functions for Toluene (C7H8).**\nNow, we multiply the number of functions per atom by the number of atoms of each type in the molecule and sum them up.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n*   **Total Number of Functions:**\n    *   Total = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n*   Molecule: Toluene (C7H8)\n*   Basis Set: 6-31G\n*   Functions per C atom: 9\n*   Functions per H atom: 2\n*   Total functions = (7 C atoms * 9 functions/C) + (8 H atoms * 2 functions/H) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
