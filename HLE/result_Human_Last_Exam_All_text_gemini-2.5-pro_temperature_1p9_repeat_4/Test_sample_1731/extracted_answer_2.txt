The equilibrium values are determined by the temperature T of the photon gas.
The equilibrium mean energy, expressed as energy density u, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
`u(T) = (8π^5 k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) * T^4`

The equilibrium entropy, expressed as entropy density s, is given by:
`s(T) = (32π^5 k_B^4 / (45 h^3 c^3)) * T^3`

where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is Planck's constant, and `c` is the speed of light.
