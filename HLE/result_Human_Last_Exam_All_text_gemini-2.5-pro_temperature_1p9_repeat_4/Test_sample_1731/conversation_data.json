    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n**1. Interpreting the Role of Large Deviation Theorems**\n\nThe question asks to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These are fundamental results in the theory of large deviations, which mathematically describes the probability of rare events.\n\n*   **Connection to Statistical Mechanics**: In statistical mechanics, the macroscopic properties of a system in equilibrium are determined by the overwhelmingly most probable microscopic configuration. The large deviation theorems provide a rigorous foundation for this idea. They state that the probability of observing a macroscopic state (e.g., a specific energy distribution) that deviates from the most probable (equilibrium) state decreases exponentially with the size of the system (e.g., the number of particles `N`).\n*   **The Rate Function and Entropy**: The probability of a deviation is given by `P(deviation) ≈ exp(-N * I)`, where `I` is the \"rate function.\" In physics, the probability of a macrostate `{N_i}` is proportional to the number of corresponding microstates `Ω`, `P({N_i}) ∝ Ω({N_i})`. For large systems, Boltzmann's formula states `S = k_B log Ω`, so `P({N_i}) ∝ exp(S/k_B)`.\n*   **Principle of Maximum Entropy**: Comparing these two forms, we see that the rate function `I` is directly related to the negative of the entropy per particle, `I ∝ -S/N`. Therefore, finding the state of minimum deviation (i.e., the most probable or equilibrium state) is equivalent to finding the state of maximum entropy.\n*   **Conclusion**: The instruction to use these theorems directs us to solve the problem by maximizing the statistical entropy of the system subject to physical constraints.\n\n**2. The System: A Gas of Light Quanta (Photons)**\n\nWe need to identify the correct statistical model for photons.\n\n*   **Bosons**: Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. This means any number of identical photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Indistinguishable Particles**: All photons of the same frequency are identical and indistinguishable.\n*   **Number Not Conserved**: Photons can be created and annihilated (e.g., emitted and absorbed by the walls of a container). This means the total number of photons `N` is not a fixed quantity. In the language of statistical mechanics, this implies that the chemical potential `μ` is zero.\n\n**3. The Bose-Einstein Entropy Formula**\n\nThe entropy `S` is given by `S = k_B log Ω`, where `Ω` is the number of microscopic states corresponding to a given macroscopic state.\n\n*   **Macrostate**: A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers `{N_i}`, where `N_i` is the number of photons in the energy level `ε_i`.\n*   **Degeneracy**: Each energy level `ε_i` may consist of `g_i` distinct quantum states (degeneracy).\n*   **Counting Microstates (`Ω`)**: For bosons, the number of ways to distribute `N_i` indistinguishable particles among `g_i` distinguishable states is `Ω_i = (N_i + g_i - 1)! / (N_i! (g_i - 1)!)`.\n*   **Total Microstates**: The total number of microstates for the macrostate `{N_i}` is the product over all energy levels: `Ω = Π_i Ω_i`.\n*   **Entropy Expression**: Using Stirling's approximation (`log x! ≈ x log x - x` for large numbers) and letting `n_i = N_i/g_i` be the average occupation number per state, the total entropy simplifies to:\n    `S = k_B Σ_i g_i [ (1+n_i) log(1+n_i) - n_i log(n_i) ]`\n\n**4. The Maximization Procedure to Find Equilibrium**\n\nThe equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the entropy `S` under the given constraints.\n\n*   **Constraint**: The only constraint for a photon gas is the fixed total energy `E`.\n    Constraint equation: `Σ_i N_i ε_i = Σ_i g_i n_i ε_i = E`.\n*   **Method**: We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S({n_i})` subject to the constraint on `E`. We define a function `L = S/k_B - β(Σ_i g_i n_i ε_i - E)`, where `β` is the Lagrange multiplier.\n*   **Optimization**: Setting the derivative `∂L/∂n_k = 0` gives the condition for the equilibrium distribution.\n    `g_k [log(1+n_k) - log(n_k)] - β g_k ε_k = 0`\n    `log((1+n_k)/n_k) = β ε_k`\n\n**5. Equilibrium Distribution: Planck's Law**\n\nSolving the result of the maximization for `n_k` yields the equilibrium occupation numbers.\n\n*   `(1+n_k)/n_k = exp(β ε_k)`\n*   `1/n_k + 1 = exp(β ε_k)`\n*   `<n_k> = 1 / (exp(β ε_k) - 1)`\n    This is the celebrated **Planck distribution law**. The angle brackets `< >` denote equilibrium average values. The Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified from thermodynamics as `β = 1/(k_B T)`, where `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n**6. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nTo get the value of the mean energy `E`, we must sum the energy `ε` over all possible states, weighted by the equilibrium occupation number `<n(ε)>`.\n\n*   **Continuum Limit**: For a macroscopic system, the energy levels are closely spaced, so we replace the sum `Σ_i g_i ...` with an integral `∫ g(ε) ... dε`.\n*   **Density of States**: A crucial point is to use the correct density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D box of volume `V`. This is given by `g(ε)dε = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2 dε`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Integral for Energy**:\n    `E = ∫₀^∞ ε <n(ε)> g(ε) dε = ∫₀^∞ ε * [1 / (exp(βε) - 1)] * [(8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2] dε`\n    `E = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ∫₀^∞ ε^3 / (exp(βε) - 1) dε`\n*   **Solving the Integral**: The integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function. By substituting `x = β ε`, the integral becomes `(1/β^4) ∫ x^3/(e^x-1)dx = (1/β^4) * (π^4/15)`.\n*   **Final Expression for Energy**: Substituting this back and using `β=1/(k_B T)`, we get the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    `E = (8π^5 k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) V T^4`.\n    The **equilibrium mean energy density** `u = E/V` is `u = a T^4`, where `a = (8π^5 k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3))` is the radiation constant.\n\n**7. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nWe can find the equilibrium entropy by either plugging the equilibrium distribution `<n_i>` back into the entropy formula (which is mathematically intensive) or by using a fundamental thermodynamic relation.\n\n*   **Thermodynamic Route**: For any system, the Grand Potential is `Φ = E - TS - μN`. For photons, `μ=0`, so `Φ = E - TS`.\n*   **Photon Gas Pressure**: The Grand Potential is also given by `Φ = -PV`. For a relativistic gas like photons, the pressure `P` is related to the energy density `u` by `P = u/3`. Since `u = E/V`, we have `P = E/(3V)`.\n*   **Relation between S and E**: Combining these gives `Φ = - (E/3V) * V = -E/3`.\n    Therefore, `-E/3 = E - TS`.\n    `TS = E + E/3 = (4/3)E`\n    `S = (4/3) E / T`\n*   **Final Expression for Entropy**: Substituting the expression for `E` from the previous step:\n    `S = (4/3) * (a V T^4) / T = (4/3) a V T^3`.\n    The **equilibrium entropy density** `s = S/V` is `s = (4/3) a T^3`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis above leads directly to the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy. Expressed as densities to remove the dependence on system volume `V`, they are functions of the temperature `T`, which defines the thermal equilibrium.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy**: The energy density `u` is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    `u(T) = (E/V) = (8π^5 k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4`\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Entropy**: The entropy density `s` is derived from the energy density:\n    `s(T) = (S/V) = (4/3) * (E/V) / T = (4/3) * u(T)/T = (4/3) * a T^3`\n    `s(T) = (4/3) * (8π^5 k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^3 = (32π^5 k_B^4 / (45 h^3 c^3)) T^3`\n\nThese expressions represent the equilibrium values sought.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values are determined by the temperature T of the photon gas.\nThe equilibrium mean energy, expressed as energy density u, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`u(T) = (8π^5 k_B^4 / (15 h^3 c^3)) * T^4`\n\nThe equilibrium entropy, expressed as entropy density s, is given by:\n`s(T) = (32π^5 k_B^4 / (45 h^3 c^3)) * T^3`\n\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is Planck's constant, and `c` is the speed of light.>>>"
