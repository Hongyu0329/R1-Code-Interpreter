    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of Dirichlet characters\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet the prime factorization of $N$ be $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$.\nThen, any character $\\chi \\pmod{N}$ can be uniquely written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$\nwhere each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe key properties relating the composite character $\\chi$ to its components $\\chi_i$ are:\n1.  **Conductor:** The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components: $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\text{cond}(\\chi_i)$. A character $\\chi \\pmod{N}$ is **primitive** if and only if its conductor is $N$. This implies that each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n\n### Step 2: Factorize N and identify the components\n\nWe are given $N = 36036$. Let's find its prime factorization:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nWe need to find the number of characters $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ such that:\n1.  Each $\\chi_{q}$ (where $q \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$) is a primitive character modulo $q$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nThis implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_q)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### Step 3: Count the valid choices for each component character\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters modulo each prime power factor $q$ whose order divides 6. Let $P_k(q)$ denote the number of primitive characters mod $q$ of order $k$. The number of characters of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (where $k|m$) is $\\phi(k)$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_4$ (mod $2^2$):**\n    *   The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$.\n    *   The primitive characters mod 4 are those not induced from mod 1 or mod 2. There is $\\psi(4) = \\phi(4) - \\phi(2) = 2 - 1 = 1$ such character. (Some sources may use $\\phi(4)-\\phi(1)=1$, result is the same.)\n    *   This single primitive character has order 2. Since $2|6$, this is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: **1**. (This choice has order 2).\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_9$ (mod $3^2$):**\n    *   The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 9-3=6$.\n    *   The non-primitive characters are induced from mod 3. The character group mod 3 has order $\\phi(3)=2$. So there is 1 character of order 1 and 1 character of order 2 that are non-primitive mod 9.\n    *   The characters mod 9 have orders 1($\\times 1$), 2($\\times 1$), 3($\\times 2$), 6($\\times 2$).\n    *   The primitive characters are those not of order 1 or 2. So the primitive characters are the 2 of order 3 and the 2 of order 6.\n    *   Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $P_3(9)+P_6(9) = 2 + 2 = \\boldsymbol{4}$. (These choices have orders 3 or 6).\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_7$ (mod 7):**\n    *   The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    *   All non-principal characters are primitive. We need those whose order divides 6. All orders in this group divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices: $\\psi(7) = \\phi(7)-1 = 5$.\n    *   These have orders 2 ($\\phi(2)=1$ char), 3 ($\\phi(3)=2$ chars), and 6 ($\\phi(6)=2$ chars). Total: $1+2+2=5$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: **5**.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{11}$ (mod 11):**\n    *   The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$.\n    *   All non-principal characters are primitive. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6.\n    *   The order must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. As the character must be primitive, the order cannot be 1. So the order must be 2.\n    *   The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: **1**. (This choice has order 2).\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{13}$ (mod 13):**\n    *   The character group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    *   All non-principal characters are primitive. We need those whose order divides 6.\n    *   The order must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$. Since it's primitive, the order cannot be 1. Possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = \\boldsymbol{5}$.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the total order condition and calculate the total number\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a set of primitive components $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ where each has an order dividing 6 is the product of the number of choices for each:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must confirm that for every such combination, the resulting order is exactly 6.\nLet $K = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\n1.  From the choice for $\\chi_4$, its order is 2. Thus, $2$ must be a factor of $K$.\n2.  From the choices for $\\chi_9$, its order is either 3 or 6. In both cases, the order is a multiple of 3. Thus, $3$ must be a factor of $K$.\n3.  Since $2|K$ and $3|K$ and $\\gcd(2,3)=1$, it must be that $6|K$.\n4.  Furthermore, the order of every component character was chosen to be a divisor of 6. The lcm of numbers that all divide 6 must also divide 6. So, $K|6$.\n\nCombining $6|K$ and $K|6$, we find that $K=6$ for every possible combination.\nTherefore, all 100 combinations result in a character of order 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
