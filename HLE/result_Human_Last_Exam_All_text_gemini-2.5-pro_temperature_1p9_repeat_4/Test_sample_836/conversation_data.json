    "This question asks for the common name of a specific mathematical transformation of a physical quantity used in the study of nuclear systems. Let's break down the question to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Quantity: \"Generalized Pair Correlation Function\"**\n    *   In statistical physics and transport theory, a pair correlation function, $g(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$, describes the correlation in the probability of finding a particle at position $\\mathbf{r}_1$ at time $t_1$ and another particle at position $\\mathbf{r}_2$ at time $t_2$.\n    *   In the nuclear criticality community, the interest lies in the fluctuations of the neutron population. The key quantity is the **covariance of the neutron number density**, $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1) \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) \\rangle$, where $\\delta n$ is the fluctuation of the neutron density around its mean value. The generalized pair correlation function is either this covariance function or a quantity directly proportional to it. It quantifies how a fluctuation at one point in space-time is related to a fluctuation at another point.\n\n2.  **Understand the Mathematical Operation: \"Space-time, double Fourier transform\"**\n    *   This operation involves applying the Fourier transform to the pair correlation function with respect to both its spatial and temporal variables.\n    *   For a system that is stationary in time and homogeneous in space (a common assumption for defining such fundamental quantities), the correlation function depends only on the time difference, $\\tau = t_2 - t_1$, and the spatial separation, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$. The function becomes $C(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$.\n    *   The space-time Fourier transform is then defined as:\n        $$ S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\int d^3r \\, C(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau) \\, e^{-i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega \\tau)} $$\n    *   The resulting function, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, depends on the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ (conjugate to space $\\mathbf{r}$) and the angular frequency $\\omega$ (conjugate to time $\\tau$). This function represents the distribution of the power of the neutron population fluctuations across different spatial modes (wavelengths) and frequencies.\n\n3.  **Identify the Common Name for the Resulting Function**\n    *   The function $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ is a central quantity in many areas of physics, particularly in the study of collective phenomena and fluctuations in many-body systems.\n    *   In condensed matter physics, this exact quantity—the space-time Fourier transform of the pair correlation function of particles (e.g., atoms in a liquid or crystal)—is universally known as the **Dynamic Structure Factor**. It is directly measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments, where it reveals the collective excitations (phonons, magnons) of the material being probed.\n    *   The physics of neutron fluctuations *within* a nuclear reactor is different from neutron scattering *off* a material, but the statistical and mathematical formalism used to describe the correlations is identical.\n    *   Because of this direct mathematical analogy, researchers in the nuclear reactor noise and criticality community have adopted the same terminology. The space-time Fourier transform of the neutron density covariance is also referred to as the Dynamic Structure Factor. It describes the intrinsic collective behavior and wave-like phenomena within the neutron population itself.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction from CPSD:** This quantity, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, should not be confused with the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**. The CPSD is the Fourier transform with respect to time *only*, giving a function of frequency and the (fixed) positions of two detectors: $CPSD(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega)$. The Dynamic Structure Factor is a more fundamental quantity that also includes the spatial transform.\n*   **Analogy vs. Identity:** While the name is borrowed from condensed matter physics due to the mathematical similarity, the physical interpretation is different. In one case, it describes the properties of a target material probed by neutrons; in the nuclear criticality case, it describes the properties of the neutron population itself as a self-interacting system.\n*   **Energy Dependence:** The analysis above simplified the problem by ignoring the neutron energy variable. A full treatment would result in a Dynamic Structure Factor that also depends on initial and final energies, $S(E_1, E_2, \\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, but this does not change the fundamental name of the function.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the established name for the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function of neutrons in a multiplying medium is the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
