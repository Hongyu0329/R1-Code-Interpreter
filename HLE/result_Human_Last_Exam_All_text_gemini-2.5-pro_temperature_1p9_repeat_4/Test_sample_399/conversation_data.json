    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the type of Differential Equation:**\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$.\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\nThe equation becomes $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1) \\cdot x^2$.\nThis equation is in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = g(t)h(x)$, where $g(t) = t-1$ and $h(x) = x^2$. This means it is a **separable differential equation**.\n\n**2. Separate the variables:**\nTo solve this equation, we want to get all terms involving $x$ on one side with $dx$ and all terms involving $t$ on the other side with $dt$. We can achieve this by dividing by $x^2$ and multiplying by $dt$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n*   **Careful Point:** We have divided by $x^2$. This is only valid if $x(t) \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side of the ODE becomes $(t-1)(0)^2 = 0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is indeed a solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the particular solution we are looking for is not the trivial solution $x(t)=0$, and our division by $x^2$ is justified.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides:**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   Left side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   Right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\nCombining these and adding a constant of integration, $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nThis is the general implicit solution to the differential equation.\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to find C:**\nWe are given the initial value $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our general solution to find the value of the constant $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nNow we have the particular solution for the given initial value problem:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**5. Find the value of x(1):**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution we just found.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, to solve for $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\nFinal check of the steps and arithmetic confirms the result.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
