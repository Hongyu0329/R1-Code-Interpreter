In Malayalam (a Dravidian language from India) and Tagalog (an Austronesian language from the Philippines), the words for "mom" and "dad" are highly similar. "Amma" is a common word for "mom" in Malayalam, while the formal term in Tagalog is "Ama". For "dad", "Appa" is used in Malayalam, which is phonetically similar to the Tagalog "Ama" as well. While the most common word for broom in Tagalog is "walis" and in Malayalam is "chÅ«l", the similarity in the parental terms is notable given the lack of direct cultural contact.
