    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is a specific and memorable scene that, despite extensive searching, does not appear to directly correspond to a known film matching that exact description.\n\nWhile numerous Oscar-nominated films feature pivotal bus scenes, such as the iconic bus crash in *The Fugitive* (1993), which was nominated for seven Academy Awards, there is no evidence of the protagonist, Dr. Richard Kimble, being identified or his fate being sealed by the phrase \"Thank you\" during a bus scene. Similarly, the renowned crop duster sequence in Alfred Hitchcock's *North by Northwest* (1959), which garnered three Oscar nominations, involves a bus stop but does not feature this specific verbal cue as a turning point.\n\nSearches for films where a character's politeness leads to their downfall or where a giveaway mannerism seals their fate have not yielded a match with this particular bus scene. It is possible the film in question was not Oscar-nominated, or that some details of the scene may be remembered differently.\n\n<<<Based on the available information, there is no Oscar-nominated film that definitively matches the description of a character sealing their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus.>>>"
