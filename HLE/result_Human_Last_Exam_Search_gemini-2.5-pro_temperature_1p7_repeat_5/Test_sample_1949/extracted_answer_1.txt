The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid cannot be definitively determined in terms of physical length due to the mix of real and mythological rivers. The Tiber is the longest real-world river mentioned, at approximately 406 km. The rivers of the Underworld, such as the Styx and Acheron, are mythological and do not have measurable lengths, although the real-world Acheron is 52 km long.
