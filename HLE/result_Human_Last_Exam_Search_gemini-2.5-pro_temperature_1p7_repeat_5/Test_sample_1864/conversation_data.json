    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with the detection channels AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare a minimum of **12 essential control samples**. The accuracy of your sorting results is highly dependent on the proper use of these controls.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls you will need to prepare:\n\n**1. Unstained Control (1 sample):**\nThis control consists of your cells or beads without any fluorescent labels. It is fundamental for:\n*   Assessing the natural background fluorescence of your sample (autofluorescence).\n*   Setting the initial voltage for the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) on the flow cytometer, ensuring your entire cell population is visible and distinguishable from electronic noise.\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 samples):**\nIn a multicolor experiment, it's crucial to correct for the spectral overlap where the fluorescence of one dye \"spills over\" into the detector for another. To do this, you need a separate control for each fluorochrome in your panel:\n*   A sample stained only with AF350.\n*   A sample stained only with GFP.\n*   A sample stained only with PE.\n*   A sample stained only with AF647.\n*   A sample stained only with AF750.\n\nThese controls can use either cells or compensation beads. The staining on these controls must be as bright or brighter than what is expected in your fully stained sample.\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):**\nFMO controls are critical for accurate gate placement in multicolor experiments, especially those with five or more colors and for sorting. An FMO control is a sample stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel, except for one. This helps you visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other channels into the \"empty\" channel, allowing you to set a precise boundary between your negative and positive populations. For a robust setup, you should prepare an FMO for each color:\n*   FMO for AF350 (stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750)\n*   FMO for GFP (stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750)\n*   FMO for PE (stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750)\n*   FMO for AF647 (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750)\n*   FMO for AF750 (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647)\n\n**4. Streptavidin Non-Specific Binding Control (1 sample):**\nSince you are using streptavidin-conjugated fluorophores, it's important to have a control to assess any non-specific binding of the streptavidin to your cells. This sample should contain your cells and the streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate but without the biotinylated antibody.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential controls is:\n1 (Unstained) + 5 (Single-Stains) + 5 (FMOs) + 1 (Streptavidin) = **12 controls**\n\n**Other Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Viability Dye:** It is highly recommended to include a viability dye in sorting experiments to exclude dead cells, which can non-specifically bind antibodies and compromise the purity of your sorted populations. If you add a viability dye as a sixth fluorochrome, you will need to add a corresponding single-stain compensation control and an FMO control, bringing your total to 14 controls.\n*   **Biological Controls:** These include cells that are known to be positive and negative for the markers of interest. They help to confirm the specificity of your antibody staining.\n*   **Isotype Controls:** While their use is debated, isotype controls are sometimes used to estimate non-specific binding due to the antibody's Fc region. However, FMO controls are generally considered more reliable for setting gates.\n\n<<<12>>>"
