    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly and efficiently synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases in a nickel container. The optimal temperature for this reaction is frequently cited as 400°C.\n\nThe synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, often in a 1:5 molar ratio, to 400°C at several atmospheres of pressure. A temperature range of 350°C to 450°C is also effective, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction. While a higher temperature of 600°C (873 K) has been mentioned, 400°C is the most commonly referenced optimal temperature.\n\nControlling the temperature is crucial for the efficient production of XeF₄. At lower temperatures, the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂) is favored. Conversely, higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine can lead to the production of xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Therefore, 400°C represents a balance that allows for the efficient synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride while minimizing impurities.\n\nOther synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge at low temperatures or a photochemical reaction, but these can also produce XeF₂ as an impurity or require specific catalysts. For instance, a reaction involving chromium(V) fluoride can produce XeF₄ at 120°C, but this is not the standard synthesis method.\n\nBased on the most common and efficient method of synthesis, 400°C is the established temperature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
