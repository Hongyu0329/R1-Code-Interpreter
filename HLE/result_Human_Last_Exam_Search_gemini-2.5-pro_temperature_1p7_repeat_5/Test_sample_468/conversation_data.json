    "The commonly used name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is \"fairy bees\". The native range of *Perdita* is North America, with a high diversity in the desert regions of the United States and Mexico. They are also referred to as miner bees, though \"fairy bees\" is more specifically associated with the genus.\n\nThe exact year that the name \"fairy bees\" was coined is not well-documented. The use of common names for many bee species is a relatively recent and informal development, and many still lack standardized common names. There is a rumor that the name may have been popularized through social media, but there is no definitive source to confirm this or provide a specific year of origin.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, not documented>>>"
