    "There are exactly **15** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA thorough classification was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2009 paper, \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". The term \"sum-free\" is typically used for abelian groups, but the concept is equivalent to \"product-free\" for general finite groups. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n\nThe finite groups that contain such sets of size 2 are:\n\n**Abelian Groups (10 groups):**\n*   **Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   C₅ (Cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   C₆ (Cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   C₇ (Cyclic group of order 7)\n    *   C₈ (Cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   C₉ (Cyclic group of order 9)\n    *   C₁₀ (Cyclic group of order 10)\n    *   C₁₁ (Cyclic group of order 11)\n    *   C₁₂ (Cyclic group of order 12)\n*   **Non-Cyclic Abelian Groups:**\n    *   C₂ × C₂ (The Klein four-group)\n    *   C₄ × C₂ (The direct product of cyclic groups of order 4 and 2)\n\n**Non-Abelian Groups (5 groups):**\n*   **Dihedral Group:**\n    *   D₆ (The dihedral group of order 6, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n*   **Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups:**\n    *   Q₈ (The quaternion group of order 8)\n    *   Q₁₂ (The dicyclic group of order 12)\n    *   C₂ × Q₈ (The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and the quaternion group)\n*   **Special Linear Group:**\n    *   SL(2,3) (The special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements)\n\nThis complete classification is the result of analyzing the structure of the group generated by the product-free set and the properties of sets containing no, one, or two involutions.\n\n<<<15>>>"
