    "**An American in Paris (1951)** was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film features an elaborate seventeen-minute ballet sequence that includes a set designed to represent the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where the iconic Egyptian obelisk is located.\n\nThe film, which won a total of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, is renowned for its visually stunning and imaginative musical numbers. The extended ballet finale, choreographed by and starring Gene Kelly, is particularly celebrated. Within this sequence, various Parisian landmarks are recreated on soundstages with a \"painterly\" aesthetic. Multiple sources confirm that one of the settings in this dream-like ballet is the Place de la Concorde, complete with its famous fountain. A model of the fountain was even constructed for the production to aid in planning the complex scenes.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners have also featured Parisian settings, such as *Gigi* (1958) which also includes scenes at the Place de la Concorde, *An American in Paris* predates them. Earlier winners like *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), though set in Paris, do not have evidence of depicting this specific landmark. Later, *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) included scenes filmed in Paris, however, the balloon departure was a studio set, and there's no clear indication of the Luxor Obelisk being shown.\n\nTherefore, the first instance of a Luxor Obelisk appearing in a Best Picture-winning film is in the stylized Parisian dreamscape of *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
