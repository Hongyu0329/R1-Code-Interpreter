Based on the body of evidence, CAR T-cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a significantly enhanced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T-cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is evidenced by IL-15's known role in promoting T-cell activation and effector functions, leading to increased polyfunctionality and a higher incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in clinical applications.
