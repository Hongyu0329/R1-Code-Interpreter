    "It is not possible to provide a number for how many \"pas de Balanchines\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\" The reason is that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized term for a specific, countable ballet step.\n\nWhile the choreography of William Forsythe, particularly in a piece like \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" is heavily influenced by the style of George Balanchine, this influence manifests as a quality of movement rather than the inclusion of a specific, named step called a \"pas de Balanchine.\" Forsythe is known for deconstructing the classical ballet vocabulary and reassembling it in new and unexpected ways. His work is often described as using the traditional steps as an \"alphabet\" to create a new language of dance.\n\nThe title of the solo, \"Jete Woman,\" refers to the \"jet√©,\" a type of jump, which is a standard ballet step. Choreographic analyses of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" discuss its structure as a theme and variations and note its demanding, athletic, and deconstructed classical technique. However, there is no mention in reliable sources of a specific movement being called a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\nTherefore, without a definition of what a \"pas de Balanchine\" is within the context of this specific choreography, a numerical count cannot be provided. It is likely a misunderstanding of ballet terminology. Svetlana Gileva was a celebrated dancer with the Semperoper Ballett and her performances in Forsythe's works were highly acclaimed for their technical brilliance and powerful execution.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a number for this specific query as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized ballet step.>>>"
