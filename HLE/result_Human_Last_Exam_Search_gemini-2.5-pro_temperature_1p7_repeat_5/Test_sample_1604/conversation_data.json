    "The battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that was the latest historically is the **Battle of Loos**.\n\nElizabeth Southerden Thompson, known as Lady Butler, was renowned for her military paintings. While many of her famous works depict 19th-century conflicts, she also created pieces illustrating events from the First World War. Among these is a watercolour that portrays the London Irish Rifles at the Battle of Loos.\n\nThe Battle of Loos took place from September 25 to October 8, 1915. This makes it the latest historical battle among her known works.\n\nOther battles depicted by Lady Butler include:\n*   **Retreat to Corunna** (1809)\n*   **Battle of Quatre Bras** (June 16, 1815)\n*   **Battle of Balaclava** (October 25, 1854)\n*   **Battle of Inkerman** (November 5, 1854)\n*   **The Defence of Rorke's Drift** (January 22-23, 1879)\n*   **Battle of Laing's Nek** (January 28, 1881), depicted in her painting \"Floreat Etona!\"\n*   **Battle of Tel el-Kebir** (September 13, 1882)\n*   **Retreat from Mons** (August 23, 1914)\n*   **First Battle of Ypres** (October-November 1914)\n\nComparing the dates of these conflicts clearly establishes the Battle of Loos as the most recent historical event painted by Lady Butler.\n\n<<<Battle of Loos>>>"
