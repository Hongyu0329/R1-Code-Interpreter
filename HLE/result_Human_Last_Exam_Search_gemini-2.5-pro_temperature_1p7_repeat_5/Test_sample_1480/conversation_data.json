    "The rule activation level, also known as the firing strength, in a fuzzy logic system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the membership degrees of the inputs in the antecedent (IF part) of a rule. While the context is an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the provided values are crisp numbers (0.7 and 0.9), suggesting a simplified version of the problem focusing on the fundamental t-norm calculation. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation.\n\nGiven the values `Φ_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, we interpret these as the membership degrees of the two antecedent parts of a single rule. To find the overall rule activation level, a t-norm is applied. Since no specific t-norm was mentioned, the calculation will be shown for the two most common types: the Minimum t-norm and the Product t-norm.\n\n### Calculation with Minimum T-Norm\n\nThe Minimum t-norm, also called the Gödel t-norm, takes the minimum of the values.\n*   **Formula**: T(a, b) = min(a, b)\n*   **Calculation**: min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n### Calculation with Product T-Norm\n\nThe Product t-norm multiplies the values.\n*   **Formula**: T(a, b) = a * b\n*   **Calculation**: 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nThe rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm chosen for the fuzzy system's conjunction operation. For the Minimum t-norm, the activation level is **0.7**. For the Product t-norm, the activation level is **0.63**.\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 using the minimum t-norm, or 0.63 using the product t-norm.>>>"
