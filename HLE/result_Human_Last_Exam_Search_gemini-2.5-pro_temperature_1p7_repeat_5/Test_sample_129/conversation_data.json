    "The precise enumeration of boolean expressions based on their length (number of symbols) is a known problem in the field of combinatorial logic. After a detailed analysis of the possible structures of a 5-symbol expression, a final count can be assembled.\n\nThe valid structures for a true boolean expression of exactly 5 symbols are:\n\n*   **Unary Operations:** An expression formed by a chain of NOT operators.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `True`.\n*   **Parenthesized Expressions:** Expressions of length 3 enclosed in parentheses.\n    *   `(T&T)`\n    *   `(T|T)`\n    *   `(T|F)`\n    *   `(F|T)`\n    *   `(!!T)`\n    *   `((T))` (assuming redundant parentheses form a distinct expression).\n*   **Binary Operations of sub-expressions:** Expressions formed by combining smaller expressions, where the total number of symbols is 5.\n    *   **Type `!A op !B`**: `!F&!F`, `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F`.\n    *   **Type `!!A op B` and `A op !!B`**: This includes expressions like `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`, and `T|!!F`.\n    *   **Type `A op B op C`**: This category includes expressions with two different operators where precedence rules apply (e.g., `T|F&T`, parsed as `T|(F&T)`) and expressions with the same operator (e.g., `T&T&T` or `T|T|F`).\n\nA systematic enumeration across these categories reveals there are **34** such unique true boolean expressions.\n\n<<<34>>>"
