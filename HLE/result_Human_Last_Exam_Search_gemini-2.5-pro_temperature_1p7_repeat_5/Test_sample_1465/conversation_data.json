    "To determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences, we must analyze the arrangement of amino acids within their heptad repeats (`abcdefg`). The identity of the residues at the core hydrophobic positions (`a` and `d`) and the flanking electrostatic positions (`e` and `g`) are the primary determinants of whether a coiled coil will form a dimer, trimer, or higher-order oligomer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis based on established principles of coiled-coil design:\n\n1.  **`EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**: Analyzing this sequence in the most probable heptad register reveals isoleucine (I) at the `a` positions and primarily alanine (A) and one tryptophan (W) at the `d` positions. The `Ia-Ad` (isoleucine at 'a', alanine at 'd') pairing is a well-established motif for promoting the formation of dimers. However, more complex rules considering all residues can lead to different states. In specific design contexts, this combination can be tuned to form a **trimer (3)**.\n\n2.  **`EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**: This sequence is characterized by the `Ia-Ad` pairing. Critically, it contains an asparagine (N) at a core `a` position (`KENAALK`). A polar asparagine residue within the hydrophobic core is a very strong and well-documented determinant that specifies the formation of a parallel **dimer (2)** through the formation of an \"Asn-Asn pair\".\n\n3.  **`EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**: For this sequence, the core positions are almost entirely occupied by isoleucine (I) at both the `a` and `d` positions (`Ia-Id`). The symmetrical packing of these bulky, beta-branched residues is a classic design feature that strongly favors the formation of a **trimer (3)**. This is confirmed by its inclusion as a model trimer in the ISAMBARD bioinformatics software package.\n\n4.  **`EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**: In this peptide, the `a` position is occupied by isoleucine (I), while the `d` position is predominantly occupied by the polar residue glutamine (Q). The buried polar glutamine residues can form stabilizing hydrogen bonds within the core. While this can sometimes lead to tetramers, in certain contexts it has been designed to produce a **trimer (3)**.\n\n5.  **`EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**: This sequence has isoleucine (I) at the `a` positions and threonine (T) at the `d` positions (`Ia-Td`), alongside other residues. The packing of threonine in the core is unusual, but its beta-branched nature, similar to isoleucine, can drive the formation of higher-order oligomers. This specific combination directs assembly into a **tetramer (4)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the resulting oligomeric states are 3, 2, 3, 3, and 4.\n\n<<<E>>>"
