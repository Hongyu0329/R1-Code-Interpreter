    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, which is known as the bottleneck edge or bridge.\n\nTo find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, we first need to understand the structure of the graph and the mechanics of \"randomized uniform gossiping.\"\n\n### Graph Structure\n\n*   A complete graph with *n* nodes (a K_n clique) has `n * (n-1) / 2` edges.\n*   For each of the two 5-node cliques (K5), the number of edges is `5 * 4 / 2 = 10`.\n*   The total number of edges within the two cliques is `2 * 10 = 20`.\n*   There is one additional edge, the bottleneck, connecting the two cliques.\n*   Therefore, the total number of edges in the graph is 21.\n\nThe degrees of the nodes are as follows:\n*   In each K5 clique, four nodes are connected to the other four nodes within their clique, giving them a degree of 4.\n*   One node in each clique, the \"bridgehead\" node, is connected to the other four nodes in its clique plus the bridgehead node in the other clique. This gives these two nodes a degree of 5.\n*   In total, there are 8 nodes with a degree of 4, and 2 nodes with a degree of 5.\n\n### Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\n\"Randomized uniform gossiping\" typically refers to a process where a node is selected uniformly at random, and then that node contacts one of its neighbors, also selected uniformly at random. An edge is \"sampled\" when a node contacts its neighbor via that edge.\n\nThe probability of sampling a specific edge (u, v) is the sum of the probabilities of two events:\n1.  Node `u` is chosen and it contacts neighbor `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is chosen and it contacts neighbor `u`.\n\nThe probability of selecting any single node from the 10 total nodes is 1/10.\n\nLet the bottleneck edge connect node `a` in the first clique and node `b` in the second. As established, the degrees of these two bridgehead nodes (`deg(a)` and `deg(b)`) are both 5.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is calculated as follows:\n*   The probability of selecting node `a` (1/10) and then it choosing to contact node `b` from its 5 neighbors (1/5) is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n*   The probability of selecting node `b` (1/10) and then it choosing to contact node `a` from its 5 neighbors (1/5) is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of these two mutually exclusive events:\n`1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThus, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
