In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in frequency-momentum space has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k of the form **G₀(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵ_k)**, with the precise form being **G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))**, where ω is the frequency, μ is the chemical potential, and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. This means that G₀ has simple poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues.
