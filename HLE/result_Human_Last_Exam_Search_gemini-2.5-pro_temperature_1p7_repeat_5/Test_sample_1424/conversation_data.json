    "## Unveiling the Connection: How the Bare Green's Function Depends on Single-Particle Energies\n\nIn the framework of the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. In its most common representation in frequency-momentum space, G₀(k, ω) is expressed as a sum of terms that have simple poles at these energy eigenvalues.\n\nFor a non-interacting many-particle system, the bare Green's function describes the propagation of a particle or a hole without being affected by interactions with other particles. Its mathematical form in the frequency (ω) and momentum (k) domain clearly shows its reliance on the single-particle energies ϵ_k.\n\nA widely used expression for the bare Green's function at zero temperature is:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))**\n\nwhere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the energy eigenvalue of a single-particle state with momentum k.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which determines the Fermi energy at zero temperature.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimally small imaginary part, with η being a small positive number. The sign of this term, determined by the sign function (sgn), ensures the correct time-ordering of events. For particle states (ϵ_k > μ), the pole is shifted slightly into the upper half of the complex frequency plane, and for hole states (ϵ_k < μ), it is shifted into the lower half.\n\nThis expression can also be written in a more detailed form that explicitly shows the contributions from particle and hole states:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = (1 - n_k) / (ω - ϵ_k + iη) + n_k / (ω - ϵ_k - iη)**\n\nHere, n_k is the occupation number for the state k. At zero temperature, n_k is 1 for occupied states (ϵ_k < μ) and 0 for unoccupied states (ϵ_k > μ).\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is characterized by an inverse relationship with the difference between the frequency ω and the energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. This relationship defines the propagation of a free particle in the system, with the poles of G₀ corresponding precisely to the energies of the allowed single-particle states. The Dyson equation further utilizes this bare Green's function as a starting point to calculate the full Green's function for an interacting system.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in frequency-momentum space has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k of the form **G₀(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵ_k)**, with the precise form being **G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))**, where ω is the frequency, μ is the chemical potential, and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. This means that G₀ has simple poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues.>>>"
