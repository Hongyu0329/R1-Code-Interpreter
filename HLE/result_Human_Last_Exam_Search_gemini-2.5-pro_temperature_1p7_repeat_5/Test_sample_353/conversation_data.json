    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by a precise analytical expression derived from the analysis of the stability region of the method. The stability of BDF methods is a classical topic in numerical analysis, and the maximum angles of stability have been determined exactly.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability is approximately $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$. The exact value of this angle, expressed in radians, can be given in terms of the arctangent function. The value is derived by finding the maximum angle of a wedge, symmetric with respect to the negative real axis, that is contained within the stability region of the numerical method.\n\nAccording to research by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and simplified by Gander and Wanner, the exact expression for the tangent of this angle can be found. The paper by Gander and Wanner, titled \"Exact BDF Stability Angles with Maple\", provides a methodology to compute this value. For the 4-step BDF method (BDF4), the tangent of the stability angle `Î±` is given by an expression involving a square root, which arises from finding the maximum of a rational function.\n\nBased on the established literature, the exact value is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{21\\sqrt{15}}{17}\\right)$.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{21\\sqrt{15}}{17}\\right)$>>>"
