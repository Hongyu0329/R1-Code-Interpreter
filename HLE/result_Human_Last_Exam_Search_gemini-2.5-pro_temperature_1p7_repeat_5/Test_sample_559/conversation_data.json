    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors, and such curves are typically associated with the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$\n$u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points $(d, u)$ occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = 0$, we have $(u - 1)u^2 = 0$, which yields $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t) = 0$:\n    $2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t) = 0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1 - 1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d + 1) = 0$.\n    This gives two equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nWe analyze the stability of these points using the Jacobian matrix:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an **unstable node**.\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. With one positive and one negative eigenvalue, (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so linearization is inconclusive. This point is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nSeparatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We are looking for a curve that acts as a separatrix, which in this case will be related to the saddle point at (-1, 1). A particularly important type of separatrix is a heteroclinic orbit, which is a trajectory that connects two different equilibrium points.\n\nLet's test for a simple analytical solution for the trajectories, which are governed by the equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1 - u)}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n\nWe can test if a simple polynomial relationship between `d` and `u` satisfies this equation. Let's try the curve $d = -u^2$. This curve has the property that it passes through two of the equilibrium points:\n*   If $u = 0$, then $d = 0$, which is the point (0, 0).\n*   If $u = 1$, then $d = -1$, which is the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\nNow we check if $d = -u^2$ is a solution.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the trajectory equation is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) becomes:\n$RHS = \\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n$RHS = \\frac{2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n$RHS = \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u - 1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n$RHS = -2u$\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the equation $d = -u^2$ describes a trajectory of the system. This trajectory connects the saddle point (-1, 1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0). Such a connecting orbit is a separatrix. Specifically, it can be shown to be one of the branches of the unstable manifold of the saddle point. It separates the phase plane for $0 \\leq u < 1$ into regions with different long-term behaviors.\n\n<<<The separatrix of the system is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
