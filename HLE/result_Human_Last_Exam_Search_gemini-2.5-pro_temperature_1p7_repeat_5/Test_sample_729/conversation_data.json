    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, there are a total of **7** power subgroups.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how this number is determined:\n\n### Definition of a Generalized Quaternion Group and Power Subgroup\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 is a non-abelian group of order 128. It can be defined by the presentation:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nA subgroup *H* of a group *G* is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer *k* such that *H* consists of all the *k*-th powers of the elements of *G*. This is denoted as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n### Identifying the Power Subgroups of Q_128\n\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups, we can analyze the sets $G^k$ for different values of *k*.\n\n1.  **When *k* is an odd integer:** For any finite group *G* of an order that is a power of 2 (in this case, 128 = 2⁷), raising elements to an odd power *k* is a permutation of the group. This means that every element in the group is a *k*-th power of some other element. Therefore, for any odd *k*, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the entire group *G* itself. This gives us our first power subgroup:\n    *   $G^1 = Q_{128}$\n\n2.  **When *k* is an even integer:** Any even integer *k* can be written as $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where *m* is an odd integer and *j* ≥ 1. Since raising to the power of *m* results in the whole group, we have $G^k = (G^m)^{2^j} = G^{2^j}$. Thus, we only need to consider the powers of 2 for *k*.\n\n    *   For *k* = 2:\n        *   The squares of elements of the form $x^i$ are $x^{2i}$. These generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n        *   The squares of elements of the form $x^i y$ are $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i(yx^i y^{-1})y^2 = x^i x^{-i} y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$. Since 32 is a multiple of 2, $x^{32}$ is already in $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n        *   Therefore, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n\n    *   For *k* = 4:\n        *   The fourth powers of elements $x^i$ are $x^{4i}$, generating $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n        *   The fourth powers of elements $x^i y$ are $(x^i y)^4 = ((x^i y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n        *   Thus, $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n\n    *   Continuing this pattern for higher powers of 2:\n        *   $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n        *   $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n        *   $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 2. This is also the center of Q_128.\n        *   $G^{64} = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, the trivial subgroup.\n        *   For any $k \\ge 64$ that is a power of 2, $G^k = \\{1\\}$.\n\n### The Complete List of Power Subgroups\n\nThe distinct power subgroups of Q_128 are:\n1.  $G^1 = Q_{128}$ (order 128)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nThese are seven distinct subgroups, and they represent all possible power subgroups for the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
