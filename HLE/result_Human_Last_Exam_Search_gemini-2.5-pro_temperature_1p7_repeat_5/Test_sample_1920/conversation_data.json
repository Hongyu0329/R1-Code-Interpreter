    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we first need to determine the prime factorization of $d$.\n\nThe number 53599 can be factored as:\n$53599 = 13 \\times 4123$\n\nThrough further analysis, 4123 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of $d$ is $13^1 \\times 4123^1$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be expressed as a product of primitive characters modulo the prime power factors of $d$. In this case, $\\chi = \\chi_{13} \\chi_{4123}$, where $\\chi_{13}$ is a primitive character modulo 13 and $\\chi_{4123}$ is a primitive character modulo 4123.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of $\\chi_{13}$ and $\\chi_{4123}$. We require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This leads to three possible cases for the orders of the component characters:\n\n*   **Case 1:** ord($\\chi_{13}$) = 2 and ord($\\chi_{4123}$) = 3\n*   **Case 2:** ord($\\chi_{13}$) = 6 and ord($\\chi_{4123}$) = 1 or 3\n*   **Case 3:** ord($\\chi_{13}$) = 1 or 2 and ord($\\chi_{4123}$) = 6\n\nTo count the number of characters for each case, we need to find the number of primitive characters of a specific order for each prime factor. For a prime $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of primitive characters of order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is $\\phi(k)$.\n\nFor the conductor $p=13$:\nThe order of the character group is $\\phi(13) = 12$. The possible character orders are the divisors of 12. The number of primitive characters of a specific order is:\n*   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$\n*   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor the conductor $p=4123$:\nThe order of the character group is $\\phi(4123) = 4122$. Since $4122 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 687$, the possible character orders include 1, 2, 3, and 6. The number of primitive characters of a specific order is:\n*   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$\n*   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of characters for each case:\n\n*   **Case 1:** (ord($\\chi_{13}$) = 2, ord($\\chi_{4123}$) = 3)\n    Number of characters = $\\phi(2) \\times \\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n\n*   **Case 2:** (ord($\\chi_{13}$) = 6)\n    The order of $\\chi_{4123}$ can be 1 or 3.\n    Number of characters = $\\phi(6) \\times (\\phi(1) + \\phi(3)) = 2 \\times (1 + 2) = 6$\n\n*   **Case 3:** (ord($\\chi_{4123}$) = 6)\n    The order of $\\chi_{13}$ can be 1 or 2.\n    Number of characters = $(\\phi(1) + \\phi(2)) \\times \\phi(6) = (1 + 1) \\times 2 = 4$\n\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is the sum of the characters from all three cases:\nTotal = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
