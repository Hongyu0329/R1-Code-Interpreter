    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles to maximize catalytic performance is a complex question, as the optimal ratio is highly dependent on the specific reaction—the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting—as well as the catalyst's synthesis method and the presence of any dopants.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, research indicates that the ideal nickel concentration generally falls within a specific range of weight percentage (wt%).\n\nStudies on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts have shown that a nickel content between 5 and 12.5 wt% leads to high CO conversion rates at temperatures between 300–450 °C. Specifically, at a reaction temperature of 400 °C, catalysts with 10 wt% and 12.5 wt% Ni demonstrated nearly identical and high CO conversion rates of 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively. This suggests that a nickel loading in the upper end of this range is slightly more favorable.\n\nEven a small addition of nickel, around 2 wt%, has been shown to significantly increase the catalytic activity of ceria for the WGS reaction. However, when other elements are introduced, the optimal ratio can change. For instance, in a tungsten-doped Ni-W-Ce system, a Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 0.29 (Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂) was found to be the most active.\n\nFor the reverse Water Gas Shift (rWGS) reaction, which is mechanistically related, an optimal molar proportion of nickel around 7% in lanthanum-doped ceria has been reported to yield high activity and stability.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the case of water splitting, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio can differ depending on whether the focus is on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), or the overall water splitting process.\n\n**Overall Water Splitting:**\nA computational study modeling the water splitting reaction on Ni-Ceria nanoparticles found that a **3:1 Ni/Ce molar ratio** creates favorable electronic properties for the overall reaction.\n\n**Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):**\nFor the HER, a key half-reaction in water splitting, a different optimal ratio has been identified. In one study using Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts on nickel foam, a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (or a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5)** was found to be ideal for HER performance.\n\n**Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):**\nFor the OER, the other half-reaction, a higher nickel content appears to be beneficial. Research on NiₓCe₁₀₀₋ₓOᵧ catalysts has indicated that **Ni/Ce molar ratios of 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅)** and **1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀)** resulted in a larger electrochemically active surface area and improved catalytic activity for the OER. In systems where ceria is co-doped with nickel and iron, a total dopant level of 20 mol% has shown excellent performance for both HER and OER.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but rather a range that depends on the target application:\n*   For the **WGS reaction**, a nickel loading of **10–12.5 wt%** on a ceria support is highly effective.\n*   For **water splitting**, the optimal molar ratio varies: a **Ni/Ce ratio of ~0.5** is best for the HER, while ratios between **1 and 3** are more suitable for the OER. A **3:1 Ni/Ce ratio** is suggested by computational studies as being favorable for the overall water splitting reaction.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is approximately **10-12.5 wt% Ni** for the Water Gas Shift reaction and a molar ratio between **0.5 and 3** for water splitting, depending on the specific half-reaction being optimized.>>>"
