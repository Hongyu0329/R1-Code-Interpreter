    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is **G**.\n\nNewton devised a system where he associated the seven colors of the spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—with the notes of a musical scale. Specifically, he used the Dorian mode, a musical scale that begins on the note D.\n\nThe color resulting from the combination of yellow and blue is green. In Newton's arrangement, the colors are ordered in a sequence that mirrors the visible light spectrum. The primary colors of red, yellow, and blue were correlated with the foundational notes of a D minor chord: D, F, and A, respectively.\n\nFollowing this established sequence, the color green is positioned between yellow and blue on the color circle. The musical note that Newton assigned to the color green is **G**. The subsequent color, blue, is associated with the note **A**. Therefore, the range on Newton's color circle from green up to blue corresponds to the musical interval from G to A.\n\n<<<G>>>"
