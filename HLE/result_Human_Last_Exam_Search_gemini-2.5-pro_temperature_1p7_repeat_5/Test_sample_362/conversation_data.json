    "### Product of the Wittig Reaction is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\n\nThe reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, a Wittig reagent, yields an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The specific alkene formed is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n**Reaction Details:**\n\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, has the structure (CH₃)₃CCHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane has the structure (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃. This reagent is a type of phosphorus ylide.\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a versatile method for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. The core of the reaction is the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond by coupling the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde with the carbanionic carbon of the ylide. This process results in a predictable alkene structure where the double bond is precisely located, a key advantage over other alkene synthesis methods like alcohol dehydration.\n\nThe mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylide on the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon, leading to a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane. This intermediate then decomposes to form the final products: the stable triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O) and the alkene. The formation of the very strong phosphorus-oxygen bond in triphenylphosphine oxide is the driving force for the reaction.\n\nThe ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, is classified as an unstabilized ylide because the carbon atom bearing the negative charge is attached to alkyl groups rather than electron-withdrawing groups. Wittig reactions involving such unstabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the (Z)-alkene (cis isomer) as the major product under standard, salt-free conditions. Therefore, the primary product of this reaction is expected to be (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
