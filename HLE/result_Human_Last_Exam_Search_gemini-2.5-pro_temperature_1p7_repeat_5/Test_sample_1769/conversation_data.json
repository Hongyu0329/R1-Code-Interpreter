    "Without the Norse invasions and subsequent linguistic interaction with the Anglo-axons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely have evolved from the Old English word *sweostor*. Following the regular patterns of sound change in the English language, this word would have become **\"swester\"**.\n\nThe Old English word for a female sibling was *sweostor* or *swuster*. These words are derived from the Proto-Germanic **swestēr* and, even further back, the Proto-Indo-European **swésōr*. This ancient root is shared with many other languages, demonstrating a long history. For instance, the German word is *Schwester*, and the Latin is *soror*.\n\nThe modern form \"sister\" is a direct result of the influence of the Old Norse word *systir*. During the Viking Age, from the 8th to the 11th centuries, extensive contact between Old Norse and Old English speakers in the Danelaw led to the introduction of many Norse words and grammatical structures into English. The pronunciation of \"sister,\" with the \"i\" sound, is a clear example of this linguistic borrowing.\n\nIf the Old English *sweostor* had developed without this Scandinavian influence, it would have followed a more typical path of English phonological change. The \"eo\" sound in *sweostor* would likely have been smoothed into \"e,\" and the unstressed ending would have been reduced, resulting in a word like \"swester.\"\n\n<<<swester>>>"
