    "The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is a solution to the Diophantine equation \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz \\). These numbers can be indexed by rational numbers \\( p/q \\). In the paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\" by Esther Banaian and Archan Sen, a table of these numbers for small values of p and q is provided.\n\nFrom this table, the value for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is 8283.\n\nThe continued fraction of an integer *n* is simply [*n*]. Therefore, the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the continued fraction of 8283.\n\nThe computation is as follows:\nThe number is 8283.\nThe integer part is 8283.\nThe fractional part is 0.\nThe algorithm terminates.\n\nThus, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is.\n\n<<<>>>"
