    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a large, complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three ethynyl (`-C#C`) substituents.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group of this molecule, we first need to understand its three-dimensional structure, which is dictated by the SMILES string.\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure**: The core of the molecule is a large system of fused benzene rings. This type of structure, a graphene fragment, is known to be planar. The notation `c1...c7...c1` and the fusion pattern `c2c3c4c5c67` describe a highly symmetric, roughly triangular arrangement of these rings.\n2.  **Substituents**: Three identical ethynyl (`-C#C`) groups are attached to this core. The SMILES string indicates their placement on rings `c1`, `c3`, and `c5`, which in a symmetric, cyclical arrangement of the core rings corresponds to a highly symmetrical 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n3.  **Symmetry Elements**: Based on this structure, we can identify the following symmetry elements:\n    *   A **C₃ rotational axis** perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   Three **C₂ rotational axes** that lie in the plane of the molecule and are perpendicular to the principal C₃ axis.\n    *   A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**, which is the plane containing the entire planar molecule.\n    *   The presence of a principal C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes places the molecule in the **D** point group family.\n    *   The presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) further specifies the point group as **D₃h**.\n    *   The D₃h point group also includes three vertical mirror planes (σv) and an S₃ improper rotation axis.\n\nMolecules with D₃h symmetry include common examples like boron trifluoride (BF₃) and the eclipsed conformation of ethane. The planar, triangular structure with threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane perfectly matches the criteria for this point group.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry group of the molecule is D₃h.\n\n<<<D₃h>>>"
