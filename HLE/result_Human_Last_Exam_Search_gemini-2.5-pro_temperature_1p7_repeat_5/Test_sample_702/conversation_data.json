    "The question asks for the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The connectivity of a map is the integer $k$ such that the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of the map being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Spaces\n\nFirst, we determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces. The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $n$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\leq n$.\n\n*   **Spaces $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$**:\n    *   The $n$-sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   The loop space functor $\\Omega$ shifts the homotopy groups down by one, i.e., $\\pi_k(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(X)$. Thus, the connectivity of $\\Omega X$ is one less than the connectivity of $X$.\n    *   $S^4$ is 3-connected, so its loop space, $\\Omega S^4$, is 2-connected.\n    *   $S^6$ is 5-connected, so its loop space, $\\Omega S^6$, is 4-connected.\n\n*   **Source Space: $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$**\n    *   For a $p$-connected space $X$ and a $q$-connected space $Y$, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(p+q+1)$-connected.\n    *   Therefore, the smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   The reduced suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases the connectivity of a space by one.\n    *   Thus, the source space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n*   **Target Space: $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$**\n    *   The smash product of spheres satisfies $S^m \\wedge S^n \\cong S^{m+n}$. So, $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$.\n    *   The sphere $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n    *   Therefore, the target space $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\cong \\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Map and its Connectivity\n\nBoth the source and target spaces are 8-connected, meaning all their homotopy groups up to dimension 8 are trivial. To determine the connectivity of the map $f$, we need to analyze its effect on the first non-trivial homotopy groups.\n\n*   **First non-trivial homotopy groups**:\n    *   For a $p$-connected space $X$ and a $q$-connected space $Y$, the first non-trivial homotopy group of their smash product appears in dimension $p+q+2$, with $\\pi_{p+q+2}(X \\wedge Y) \\cong \\pi_{p+1}(X) \\otimes \\pi_{q+1}(Y)$.\n    *   For $W = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$, this is $\\pi_{2+4+2}(W) = \\pi_8(W)$.\n    *   $\\pi_8(W) \\cong \\pi_{2+1}(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\pi_{4+1}(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_4(S^4) \\otimes \\pi_6(S^6)$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_4(S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, we have $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   For the source space, by the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   For the target space, $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Map**:\n    The map $f$ relates the two spaces on their first non-trivial homotopy group, $\\pi_9$.\n    $f_*: \\pi_9(\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_9(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    This map is a specific instance of a generalized Whitehead or Samelson product, which is known to be an isomorphism on this lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy group, at least in the stable range. A theorem by V. G. Veličko states that the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B) \\to \\Omega(A \\wedge B)$ is $conn(A) + conn(B) + 3$. In our case, this would be $3 + 5 + 3 = 11$. Another known result gives the connectivity of the fiber of the adjoint map $\\tilde{f}: \\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B \\to \\Omega^2(A \\wedge B)$ to be $conn(\\Omega A)+conn(\\Omega B)+3 = 2+4+3=9$.\n\nLet's follow the consequence of the latter, more conservative estimate. If the fiber is 9-connected, the map is 10-connected. This means the map induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups for dimensions less than 10. Let's verify consistency.\n1. Assume the map's fiber is 8-connected. The map is 9-connected.\n2. From the long exact sequence of homotopy for the fibration, this means $f_*$ on $\\pi_9$ is injective. Since the groups are $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, any non-zero map is injective. These canonical maps are non-trivial.\n3. It is a standard result that this map is in fact an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$. This implies from the long exact sequence that the fiber's homotopy group $\\pi_9(F)$ is trivial.\n4. As the spaces are highly connected, the lower homotopy groups of the fiber are also trivial, making the fiber 9-connected.\n5. If the fiber is 9-connected, the map is by definition 10-connected. This means $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i < 10$ and an epimorphism for $i=10$.\n\nLet's check the groups at dimension 10:\n*   $\\pi_{10}(\\text{target}) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $\\pi_{10}(\\text{source}) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This group is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nAn epimorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ exists. If this epimorphism is not a monomorphism, the connectivity is exactly 10. This is consistent.\n\nThus, the connectivity of the map is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
