    "For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the corresponding supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model is defined on a specific target supermanifold. For a model with *n* replicas, this supermanifold is the coset space G/K, where G is the supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) and K is the supergroup U(n|n). In some literature, this is also written as SpO(n, n|2n)/U(n|n). This framework is used to study transport properties in disordered wires, and using two replicas (n=2) is necessary to calculate quantities beyond the average conductance, such as its variance.\n\nThe non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables parametrize the Bose-Bose (BB) sector of this supermanifold. The number of these variables is given by the dimension of the bosonic part of the coset space G/K. To find this, we calculate the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic parts of the Lie supergroups G and K for the case of n=2.\n\nFor two replicas (n=2), the relevant supermanifold is `SpO(2,2|4)/U(2|2)`.\n\n1.  **Numerator Group (G): `SpO(2,2|4)`**\n    *   The maximal bosonic subgroup of the orthosymplectic supergroup `OSp(p,q|2r)` is `SO(p,q) x Sp(2r,R)`. For `SpO(2,2|4)`, the bosonic subgroup is `SO(2,2) x Sp(4,R)`. The group SO(2,2) is isomorphic to SO(4).\n    *   The dimension of the special orthogonal group `SO(m)` is `m(m-1)/2`. Therefore, the dimension of `SO(4)` is `4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6`.\n    *   The dimension of the symplectic group `Sp(2r,R)` is `r(2r+1)`. For `Sp(4,R)`, `r=2`, so the dimension is `2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10`.\n    *   The total dimension of the bosonic part of G is `6 + 10 = 16`.\n\n2.  **Denominator Group (K): `U(2|2)`**\n    *   The maximal bosonic subgroup of the unitary supergroup `U(p|q)` is `U(p) x U(q)`. For `U(2|2)`, this is `U(2) x U(2)`.\n    *   The dimension of the unitary group `U(m)` is `m^2`. Therefore, the dimension of `U(2)` is `2^2 = 4`.\n    *   The total dimension of the bosonic part of K is `4 + 4 = 8`.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector is the difference between the dimensions of these two bosonic subgroups:\n\nNumber of variables = (Dimension of bosonic part of G) - (Dimension of bosonic part of K)\nNumber of variables = 16 - 8 = 8\n\n<<<8>>>"
