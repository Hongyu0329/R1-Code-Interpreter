    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. This means it is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to determine how many contracted Gaussian functions are used for each atom in the 6-31G basis set.\n\n*   **For a hydrogen atom (H):** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. For hydrogen, the 1s orbital is the valence orbital. It is represented by two basis functions. The inner part is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussian functions, and the outer part is a single primitive Gaussian function. Therefore, a hydrogen atom has **2 contracted Gaussian functions** in the 6-31G basis set.\n\n*   **For a carbon atom (C):** Carbon has a core 1s orbital and valence 2s and 2p orbitals.\n    *   The core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a sum of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The valence shell (2s and 2p) is split into two parts. This means there are two basis functions for the 2s orbital and two for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   The inner valence part is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the outer part is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This gives a total of 1 (for 1s) + 1 (for 2s inner) + 1 (for 2s outer) + 3 * (1 for 2p inner + 1 for 2p outer) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 basis functions. However, in the Pople basis sets like 6-31G, the s and p valence functions share the same exponents to improve efficiency. Therefore, there is one function for the core (1s), and for the valence shell, there are two s-type functions and two sets of p-type functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   So, for Carbon: 1 (1s) + 1 (2s) + 1 (2s') + 3 (2p) + 3 (2p') = 9 contracted Gaussian functions. The 2s and 2p orbitals make up the valence shell, and they are each split into two basis functions (a double-zeta basis set). So there are: 1 (for 1s core) + 4 (for 2sp inner) + 4 (for 2sp outer). Let's re-evaluate.\n    *   Each second-period atom (like Carbon) has a basis set of five functions in a minimal basis set (one 2s and three 2p functions, plus the 1s). For 6-31G, it is a split-valence double-zeta basis set. The core 1s orbital is one contracted function. The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two. So that is 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 2*3 (for 2p) = 9 contracted functions. Other sources confirm that for a carbon atom, the 6-31G basis set has 9 basis functions.\n\nNow I will calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8):\n*   7 Carbon atoms * 9 functions/Carbon = 63 functions\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms * 2 functions/Hydrogen = 16 functions\n*   Total = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nTherefore, for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nFinal check:\n*   C7H8: 7 Carbon, 8 Hydrogen.\n*   6-31G basis set:\n    *   H: 2s functions (split valence 1s). So 2 contracted functions.\n    *   C: 1s (core), 2s (valence), 2p (valence). The valence is split. So 1 core function + 2*1 valence s function + 2*3 valence p functions = 9 contracted functions. This is incorrect. A carbon atom has 1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals. A minimal basis set has 5 functions. In a 6-31G basis set, the core orbital is represented by one contracted function (from 6 Gaussians). The valence orbitals are split into two (double-zeta), an inner part from 3 Gaussians and an outer part from 1 Gaussian. So for the valence shell, there is a set of s and p functions (inner) and another set of s and p functions (outer). Thus, for carbon, there is 1 core (1s) function + (1 s + 3 p) inner valence functions + (1 s + 3 p) outer valence functions = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 functions.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   7 C * 9 functions/C = 63 functions.\n    *   8 H * 2 functions/H = 16 functions.\n    *   Total: 63 + 16 = 79 functions.To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we first need to find the number of functions for each type of atom present in the molecule.\n\n**1. Composition of Toluene (C7H8):**\n*   Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**2. Contracted Functions for Each Atom in the 6-31G Basis Set:**\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. This means the single 1s valence orbital of hydrogen is represented by two separate basis functions. One is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussian functions, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian function. Thus, each hydrogen atom is described by **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** A carbon atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n    *   The 1s core orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is \"split\" into two sets of functions (a double-zeta representation). This results in two s-type functions and two sets of three p-type functions (px, py, pz) for the valence electrons.\n    *   In total, for each carbon atom, there is 1 function for the 1s core, and for the valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals), there are 2 s-functions and 2x3=6 p-functions, giving a sub-total of 8 valence functions. In the Pople basis set notation, this means 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence sp) + 4 (outer valence sp) for a total of 9 functions. Several sources confirm that a carbon atom is described by **9 contracted Gaussian functions** in the 6-31G basis set.\n\n**3. Total Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions for Toluene:**\n\nNow, we calculate the total by multiplying the number of each atom by its respective number of contracted functions and summing the results:\n\n*   **From Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total = 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.**\n\n<<<79>>>"
