    "The symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle can be found in the comprehensive online database \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" maintained by Eckard Specht. This database is a standard reference for this type of problem.\n\nWhile the search results confirm that this database includes entries up to N=2600 and provides the symmetry group for each packing in Schoenflies notation, the specific entry for N=1135 is not fully displayed in the search snippets, preventing a direct confirmation of its symmetry group. For many large, non-special numbers of circles, the resulting packing is often asymmetrical, corresponding to a C₁ symmetry group.\n\nTherefore, to obtain a definitive answer, it is recommended to consult the data table directly on the \"Packomania\" website.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
