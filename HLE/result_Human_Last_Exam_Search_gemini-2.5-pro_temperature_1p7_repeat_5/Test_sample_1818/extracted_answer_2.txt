The optimal setting is the lowest possible Spreading Factor (starting from SF7 and increasing sequentially) at which the 1% Packet Error Rate can be achieved using a transmit power within the available range of 2 dBm to 14 dBm. The corresponding optimal transmission power is the minimum power in that range that satisfies the PER requirement. This strategy ensures the shortest possible Time on Air, which is the dominant factor in minimizing energy consumption.
