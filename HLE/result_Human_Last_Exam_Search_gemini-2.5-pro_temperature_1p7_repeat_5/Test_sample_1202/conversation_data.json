    "When a gene is duplicated, it results in two identical copies. Initially, this redundancy means that one copy is often lost to mutation without affecting the organism. For both copies to be kept (retained) and to change over time (diverge), a selective pressure must exist to preserve them. Several models explain this process.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene. One copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional, turning it into a pseudogene. This process leads to the *loss* of one functional copy, not the retention of both.\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one duplicate copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other acquires mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. Natural selection then favors keeping both copies. The evolution of a completely new function is considered a relatively rare event, which has led some to question if it's the most common mechanism for retention.\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** This model, also called the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or was expressed in different tissues (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy sustains mutations that degrade a different subfunction. As a result, both genes are now required to collectively perform the full scope of the original ancestral gene's functions. This \"division of labor\" provides a powerful reason to retain both gene copies.\n\n**Comparing the Mechanisms for Retention and Divergence:**\n\n*   **Gene conversion** is a mechanism that makes homologous DNA sequences identical, so it works *against* the divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   **Pseudogenization** results in the loss of a functional gene, not its retention.\n*   **Adaptive radiation** is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism for gene retention.\n*   Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted mechanisms that explain both the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more common and likely pathway because it relies on more frequent, neutral loss-of-function mutations rather than the rarer gain of a novel, beneficial function required for neofunctionalization. Subfunctionalization provides a parsimonious explanation for keeping duplicate genes, allowing them time to diverge. Studies suggest that subfunctionalization may act as a transitional state, preserving genes that might later undergo neofunctionalization.\n\nGiven that subfunctionalization provides a more pervasive and passive route for preserving duplicates through the common process of degenerative mutations, it is considered the most likely mechanism responsible for the widespread retention and divergence of duplicate genes observed in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
