    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a specific generalization of coupled and tripled fixed point concepts in mathematics, particularly in the field of functional analysis. The conditions for its existence are typically established in the context of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\n### Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nGiven three non-empty sets X, Y, and Z, and three mappings:\n*   F: X × Y × Z → X\n*   G: Y × X × Y → Y\n*   H: Z × Y × X → Z\n\nA point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is called an **FGH-tripled fixed point** if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n*   x = F(x, y, z)\n*   y = G(y, x, y)\n*   z = H(z, y, x)\n\nThis concept is a generalization of a standard tripled fixed point and an extension of an FG-coupled fixed point.\n\n### Conditions for the Existence of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nThe existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed under a set of conditions, which are typically presented in the form of a theorem. These theorems usually require the underlying sets to be complete metric spaces with a partial ordering and for the functions to satisfy certain monotonicity and contraction-type properties.\n\nThe primary conditions are as follows:\n\n1.  **The Space**: (X, d_X, ≤_X), (Y, d_Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ≤_Z) must be **partially ordered complete metric spaces**. This means that X, Y, and Z are equipped with both a partial order relation (≤) and a complete metric (d), where the topological structure is compatible with the order structure.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a **mixed monotone property**. This property describes how the functions behave with respect to the partial order. For instance, the mapping F: X × Y × Z → X has the mixed monotone property if F(x,y,z) is non-decreasing with respect to x and z, and non-increasing with respect to y. That is, for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n    *   If x₁ ≤_X x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤_X F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   If y₁ ≤_Y y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≥_X F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   If z₁ ≤_Z z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≤_X F(x, y, z₂).\n    Similar mixed monotone properties must be defined and satisfied by G and H with respect to their arguments.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contraction-type inequality. This is a crucial condition that ensures the iterative sequences converge to a fixed point. There must exist non-negative constants kᵢ, lᵢ, mᵢ for i ∈ {1, 2, 3} such that their sums are less than 1 (i.e., k₁+l₁+m₁ < 1, k₂+l₂+m₂ < 1, k₃+l₃+m₃ < 1), and for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, z, w ∈ Z for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k₁ d_X(x, u) + l₁ d_Y(y, v) + m₁ d_Z(z, w)\n    *   d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ k₂ d_Y(y, v) + l₂ d_X(x, u) + m₂ d_Y(y, v)\n    *   d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k₃ d_Z(z, w) + l₃ d_Y(y, v) + m₃ d_X(x, u)\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial element (x₀, y₀, z₀) in the product space X × Y × Z that satisfies a specific order relation with its image under the mappings. For example:\n    *   x₀ ≤_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ≥_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    *   z₀ ≤_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n5.  **Continuity or a Regularity Assumption**: At least one of the following conditions must hold:\n    *   **(a) Continuity**: The mappings F, G, and H are continuous.\n    *   **(b) Regularity**: The spaces (X, Y, Z) possess a regularity property. This property ensures that for any convergent sequence that has an order (non-decreasing or non-increasing), the limit of the sequence maintains that order with the elements of the sequence.\n\n### Uniqueness of the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nIf the above conditions for existence are met, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed if the following additional condition holds:\n*   For every pair of points (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) in X × Y × Z, there exists a third point (a, b, c) that is comparable to both (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) with respect to the partial order defined on the product space.\n\nThese types of fixed-point theorems are generalizations of the well-known Banach Contraction Principle and are applied to demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for systems of nonlinear integral equations and boundary value problems.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z, defined as a point (x, y, z) such that x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x), is guaranteed to exist under several key conditions. Primarily, these conditions are established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe main conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **Space**: The domains X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Mixed Monotonicity**: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orders on X, Y, and Z.\n3.  **Contraction Mapping**: The functions must satisfy a contractive condition. This typically involves inequalities that bound the distance between the images of two points by a linear combination of the distances between the original points, with coefficients that sum to less than one.\n4.  **Initial Point**: There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that is related to its image under F, G, and H by the partial order (e.g., x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)).\n5.  **Continuity/Regularity**: The functions F, G, and H must either be continuous, or the underlying spaces must satisfy a regularity condition that ensures comparability of sequences with their limits.\n\nFor the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition is required: for any two points in the space, there must be a third point that is comparable to both. These theorems extend results from coupled and tripled fixed point theory.>>>"
