    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation occurs via a two-step process:\n\n1.  **Directed *ortho*-Metalation (DoM):** The first step is a highly regioselective deprotonation of the aromatic ring. The starting molecule, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, contains two functional groups that can direct this lithiation: the N,N-diethylcarboxamido group (-CONEt2) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at position 3. Both are known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) because their heteroatoms can coordinate to the lithium ion of the strong base, sec-BuLi. The sec-BuLi, a powerful base, is made even more reactive by the addition of TMEDA, which chelates the lithium and breaks up organolithium aggregates.\n\n    The tertiary amide group is a very strong DMG, generally more powerful than a tertiary amine group. In this case, the two groups are positioned *meta* to each other. The amide group directs lithiation to the *ortho* positions (2 and 6), while the dimethylamino group directs to its *ortho* positions (2 and 4). Since position 2 is *ortho* to both groups, they act in a cooperative or synergistic manner, making the proton at this position the most acidic. The sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex selectively removes this proton, forming a stable aryllithium intermediate: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-lithiobenzamide.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I). The carbon-lithium bond attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This results in the substitution of the lithium atom with a methyl group.\n\nThe final, stable organic compound obtained from this reaction sequence is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
