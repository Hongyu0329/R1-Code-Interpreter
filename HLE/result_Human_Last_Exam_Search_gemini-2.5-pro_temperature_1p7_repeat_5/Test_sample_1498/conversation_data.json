    "In the renowned Islamic poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets are mentioned in a distinct section. This listing begins with the bayt (verse) that introduces the obligation of knowing twenty-five prophets and continues through the verses that enumerate them.\n\nThe mention of the prophets starts from the following verse:\n\n**تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ۞ كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ**\n\n*Translation: The enumeration of twenty-five is necessary for every legally responsible person, so verify and seize the opportunity.*\n\nThe listing concludes with the verse that sends peace and blessings upon them:\n\n**عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ۞ وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ**\n\n*Translation: Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families for as long as days shall last.*\n\nThe verses in between these two systematically name the prophets, beginning with Adam and concluding with Prophet Muhammad, referred to as 'Taha'. This section is often titled \"الأنبياء والرسل\" (The Prophets and Messengers) in various publications of the poem.\n\n<<<In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from the bayt starting with \"تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\" to the bayt \"عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ\".>>>"
