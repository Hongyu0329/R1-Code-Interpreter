    "The stable reduction of the given curve has two double points.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **The Curve and Its Genus:** The curve is defined by the equation $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. This is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is 5, which means the genus of the curve is $g = (5-1)/2 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Stable Reduction and Branch Points:** The theory of stable reduction, particularly for hyperelliptic curves, states that the structure of the reduced curve is determined by the 2-adic properties of its branch points. For this curve, the branch points are the five roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ and the point at infinity.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Branch Points:**\n    *   One root is clearly $x=0$.\n    *   To analyze the other roots, we factor out x and consider the quartic polynomial $Q(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\n    *   Using Newton polygons for the prime $p=2$, we can determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $Q(x)$. The analysis shows that one root, let's call it $r_1$, has a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(r_1) = 3$. The other three roots, $r_2, r_3, r_4$, each have a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(r_i) = -1$.\n    *   So, the set of branch points is $B = \\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, \\infty\\}$. Their valuations are $v_2(0)=\\infty$, $v_2(r_1)=3$, and $v_2(r_{2,3,4})=-1$.\n\n4.  **Clustering of Branch Points:** The branch points are grouped into \"clusters\" based on their 2-adic distances.\n    *   The points $0$ and $r_1$ are \"close\" to each other in a 2-adic sense, since the valuation of their difference $v_2(0 - r_1) = v_2(r_1) = 3$ is large and positive. This forms one cluster, $C_1 = \\{0, r_1\\}$.\n    *   The remaining four points, $C_2 = \\{r_2, r_3, r_4, \\infty\\}$, form another cluster. The finite points in this cluster are all \"far\" from the origin and from $r_1$ (their difference has valuation -1). Further analysis confirms they are also \"far\" from each other, and they naturally group with the point at infinity.\n\n5.  **Structure of the Stable Reduction:** The classification of stable reductions for genus 2 curves shows that a partition of the 6 branch points into a cluster of size 2 and a cluster of size 4 results in a specific structure for the special fiber of the stable model.\n    *   The cluster of size 4 ($C_2$) gives rise to an elliptic curve (a curve of genus 1).\n    *   The cluster of size 2 ($C_1$) gives rise to a rational curve (a curve of genus 0, essentially a projective line).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Number of Double Points:** A stable curve is a connected curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes). The total arithmetic genus of the special fiber must equal the genus of the original curve. The formula relating the genera of the components and the number of nodes is:\n    $g = \\sum g_i + \\delta - (N-1)$\n    Where:\n    *   $g$ is the genus of the original curve (2).\n    *   $g_i$ are the genera of the irreducible components (1 for the elliptic curve, 0 for the rational curve).\n    *   $N$ is the number of components (2).\n    *   $\\delta$ is the number of double points.\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $2 = (1 + 0) + \\delta - (2 - 1)$\n    $2 = 1 + \\delta - 1$\n    $2 = \\delta$\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve and a rational curve that intersect at two points. These two intersection points are the double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
