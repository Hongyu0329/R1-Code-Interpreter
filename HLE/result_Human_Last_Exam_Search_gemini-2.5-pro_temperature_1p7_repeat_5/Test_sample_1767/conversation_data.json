    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 2.\n\nThis outcome is based on the principle of the additivity of the Chern number, a topological invariant that characterizes these materials. A negligible tunneling barrier implies that the two insulators effectively merge into a single, larger system. In such a composite system, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of its individual components.\n\nThe Chern number is a fundamental property of a two-dimensional material's electronic band structure and is an integer that remains unchanged by continuous deformations of the system. Materials with a non-zero Chern number are known as Chern insulators. The ability to create systems with higher Chern numbers is of significant interest in condensed matter physics. One method to achieve this is by combining materials with known Chern numbers. For instance, stacking multiple layers of a Chern insulator can result in a total Chern number equal to the sum of the layers' individual Chern numbers.\n\nIn the scenario described, since each of the two laterally connected Chern insulators has a Chern number of 1, the total Chern number of the combined system, or junction, is the sum of these, resulting in C = 1 + 1 = 2. This principle is analogous to how other topological invariants are combined in composite systems.\n\n<<<2>>>"
