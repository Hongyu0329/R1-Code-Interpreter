    "The Crayola crayon color that contains a chemical with the properties of 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is most likely **Shocking Pink**.\n\nThe chemical name \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\" is the IUPAC nomenclature for Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye well-known for its vibrant, fluorescent pink color.\n\nWhile the precise chemical compositions of Crayola crayons are proprietary, the company does manufacture a line of fluorescent, or neon, crayons. Crayola has confirmed that the \"Shocking Pink\" crayon is one of the colors that will fluoresce under a black light. This particular color was first introduced in 1972 and has been a part of Crayola's fluorescent and neon crayon assortments.\n\nThe fluorescent quality of the \"Shocking Pink\" crayon strongly indicates the use of a fluorescent dye. Given that Rhodamine B is a prominent and widely used fluorescent pink dye, its presence in the \"Shocking Pink\" crayon is highly probable. A supplier of a similar rhodamine dye, listed as \"Acid Red 52,\" also mentions crayons as a possible application for their product.\n\nAlthough Crayola has not explicitly disclosed the use of Rhodamine B, the correlation between the known properties of the chemical and the visual and fluorescent characteristics of the \"Shocking Pink\" crayon leads to this conclusion.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
