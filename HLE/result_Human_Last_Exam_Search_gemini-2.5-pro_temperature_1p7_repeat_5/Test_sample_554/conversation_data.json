    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain a variable number of fluorine atoms, as the term \"nanocar\" describes a class of molecular-scale vehicles with different structures and chemical formulas. In a perfluorinated compound, all hydrogen (H) atoms are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar's structure.\n\nSeveral different nanocars have been synthesized by research groups around the world, each with a unique molecular formula:\n\n*   One of the earliest nanocars, developed at Rice University in 2005, is sometimes associated with the chemical formula **C430H274O**. A perfluorinated version of this nanocar would hypothetically contain **274 fluorine atoms**.\n\n*   A nanocar designed for the Nanocar Race by the Toulouse Nanomobile Club, known as the \"Green Buggy,\" has the chemical formula **C184H116**. Its perfluorinated counterpart would have **116 fluorine atoms**.\n\n*   Another design, a flexible nanocar with fullerene wheels, is described with the formula **C310H34**. A perfluoronanocar based on this structure would contain **34 fluorine atoms**.\n\n*   A dipolar nanocar created for the second NanoCar Race has a chemical formula of **C85H59N5Zn**. If this molecule were to be perfluorinated, it would contain **59 fluorine atoms**.\n\nIt is important to note that the \"wheels\" of many nanocars are often made of fullerene (C60), which are carbon spheres without any hydrogen atoms and would therefore not be subject to fluorination in this context. The variation in the number of hydrogen atoms, and thus the potential number of fluorine atoms, arises from the different chemical structures of the chassis and axles that connect the fullerene wheels.\n\n<<<274>>>"
