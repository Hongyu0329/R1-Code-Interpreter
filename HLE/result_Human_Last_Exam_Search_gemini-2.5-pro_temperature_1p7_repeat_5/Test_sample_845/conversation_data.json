    "The value computed as the time between heartbeats, used for tracking HR and HRV by capturing beat-to-beat intervals with PPG, is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis value is also referred to as the beat-to-beat interval. While the term R-R interval is also commonly used in the context of HRV, it specifically refers to the interval between successive R-waves in an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform. Since the question specifies the use of photoplethysmography (PPG), \"Interbeat Interval\" (IBI) is the more general and appropriate term.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
