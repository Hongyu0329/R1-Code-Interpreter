    "The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, is a non-abelian group of order 2^9. A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup of the form G^n = {g^n | g ∈ G} for some integer n. To determine the number of distinct power subgroups of SD_512, we analyze the structure of these subgroups based on the parity of the exponent n.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD_{2^k} is given by the presentation:\n⟨a, b | a^{2^{k-1}} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^{2^{k-2}-1}⟩\n\nFor SD_512, we have k=9, so the presentation is:\n⟨a, b | a^256 = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^{127}⟩\n\nThe elements of SD_512 are of two forms: a^i and a^i*b, for 0 ≤ i < 256. We must consider the nth power of these elements.\n\n**Case 1: n is an even integer**\nLet n = 2k for some integer k.\n- For elements of the form a^i, their nth power is (a^i)^n = a^{in} = a^{2ik}. The set of these elements for all i forms the cyclic subgroup ⟨a^{2k}⟩.\n- For elements of the form a^i*b, we first compute the square: (a^i*b)^2 = a^i*b*a^i*b = a^i(bab)a^{i-1}b = a^i(a^{127i}) = a^{128i}.\nSo, the nth power is (a^i*b)^n = (a^i*b)^{2k} = ((a^i*b)^2)^k = (a^{128i})^k = a^{128ik}. The set of these elements forms the cyclic subgroup ⟨a^{128k}⟩.\n\nThe power subgroup G^n is the union of these two sets of powered elements, which is the subgroup generated by them: G^n = ⟨a^{2k}, a^{128k}⟩. Since 128 is a multiple of 2, the subgroup ⟨a^{128k}⟩ is always a subgroup of ⟨a^{2k}⟩. Thus, for any even n=2k, the power subgroup is G^n = ⟨a^{2k}⟩.\n\nThe distinct subgroups of this form are determined by the distinct even divisors of the order of 'a', which is 256. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. Each of these gives a distinct subgroup:\n⟨a^2⟩, ⟨a^4⟩, ⟨a^8⟩, ⟨a^16⟩, ⟨a^32⟩, ⟨a^64⟩, ⟨a^128⟩, and ⟨a^256⟩ (which is the trivial subgroup {e}).\nThis accounts for 8 distinct power subgroups.\n\n**Case 2: n is an odd integer**\n- For elements of the form a^i, their nth power is a^{in}. Since n is odd, it is coprime to the order of 'a' (which is a power of 2). Therefore, the set {a^{in} | 0 ≤ i < 256} generates the entire cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩.\n- For elements of the form a^i*b, their nth power is (a^i*b)^n. Since n is odd, (a^i*b)^n will be of the form a^j*b for some j. For instance, with n=1, we get all elements a^i*b.\n\nThe power subgroup G^n for an odd n must contain the full subgroup ⟨a⟩. Any subgroup of SD_512 that contains ⟨a⟩ and at least one element of the form a^j*b must be the entire group SD_512 itself. Since G^n contains such elements (for example, b^n = b when n is odd), it follows that for any odd n, G^n = SD_512. This gives one additional distinct power subgroup.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe set of power subgroups of SD_512 consists of the 8 subgroups from the even powers and the entire group itself from the odd powers. These two sets of subgroups are disjoint, as the former are all abelian (cyclic) while SD_512 is non-abelian.\nIn total, there are 8 + 1 = 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
