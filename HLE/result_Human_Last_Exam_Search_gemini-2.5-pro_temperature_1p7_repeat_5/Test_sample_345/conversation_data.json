    "## Berlin State Museums Acquired Kurt Günther's \"The Radionist\" in 1967\n\nIn 1967, the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums) acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" (*Der Radionist*) by German artist Kurt Günther. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\n\"The Radionist\" is a significant work of the New Objectivity movement, depicting a man engrossed in listening to the radio, a burgeoning technology of the time. The painting, rendered in tempera on wood, measures 55 x 49 cm. It is part of the collection of the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery), a branch of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\nThe artwork is also known by the alternative titles \"Radio Enthusiast\" and \"Petty bourgeois on the radio\" (*Kleinbürger am Radio*). The painting is a commentary on the societal changes and the role of technology in the Weimar Republic.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums)"
