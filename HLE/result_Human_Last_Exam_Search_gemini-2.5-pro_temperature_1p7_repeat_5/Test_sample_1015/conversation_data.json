    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. This difference is a reflection of the broader stylistic and technical principles that define each approach to classical ballet.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso. The backbend in a cambré derrière is initiated from the upper and middle back, with the hips remaining aligned and facing forward. This technique is designed to build a strong, controlled, and flexible spine while ensuring that the movement is supported by the core and that the body's classical lines are preserved. The Vaganova method prioritizes a codified and holistic approach, where the entire body works in harmony and alignment is paramount.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often features a more dynamic and less rigid torso. A defining characteristic of the Balanchine style, particularly in movements involving a backward extension of the leg like an arabesque, is the opening of the hip of the working leg. This allows for the illusion of a higher and more extended line. While a cambré can be performed without lifting a leg, the principle of a more flexible and less squarely held torso and hips is a hallmark of the Balanchine style, which favors speed, fluidity, and a more \"American\" and modern aesthetic. This willingness to break the traditional \"box\" of the shoulders and hips is a significant departure from the Vaganova technique.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm and head placement can also differ, the approach to the hips is a more fundamental and visually distinct point of contrast in movements that involve a backbend, including the cambré derrière. The Vaganova method's focus on a stable, square foundation contrasts with Balanchine's more open and dynamic use of the torso and hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
