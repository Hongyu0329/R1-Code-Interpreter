    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$. An adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), satisfying the inequalities $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n\nA map between posets that are complete lattices (such as the finite ordinals $[k]$) is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). For an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$, this condition is equivalent to requiring that the map preserves the supremum of the empty set, which is the least element. Therefore, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$.\n\nEach such left adjoint $f$ uniquely determines its right adjoint $g$, so the number of adjunctions is the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ that satisfy $f(0)=0$.\n\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ is fixed. The remaining values must satisfy the order-preserving property:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a combinatorial problem of choosing 23 values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which contains 38 elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter as the values will be arranged uniquely into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nThis is a problem of combinations with repetition. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} $$\nIn this problem, we are choosing $k=23$ values from a set of size $N=38$. The number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nCalculating this value gives:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = 32,233,189,444,451,133,520 $$\n\n<<<32233189444451133520>>>"
