    "The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$ is 0.\n\nTo establish this, we need to show that there exists at least one pair $(X, B)$, where $X$ is a finite ultrametric space and $B$ is a Banach space of a given cardinality $K$, for which the number of isometric embeddings is zero. An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, meaning for any two points $x_1, x_2$ in $X$, the distance $d(x_1, x_2)$ in $X$ is equal to the norm of the difference of their images in $B$, $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B$. If no such function exists, the number of embeddings is 0.\n\nWe can demonstrate this with a concrete example.\n\n### The Finite Ultrametric Space $X$\nConsider a set $X$ with three distinct points, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$. Let the distance function $d$ be defined as follows:\n- $d(x_i, x_i) = 0$ for $i=1, 2, 3$\n- $d(x_i, x_j) = 1$ for $i \\neq j$\n\nThis metric space is equivalent to an equilateral triangle with side length 1. This space is ultrametric because it satisfies the strong triangle inequality, $d(x, z) \\leq \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$. For any distinct points $x_i, x_j, x_k$, we have $d(x_i, x_k) = 1$, and $\\max(d(x_i, x_j), d(x_j, x_k)) = \\max(1, 1) = 1$. Thus, the inequality $1 \\leq 1$ holds.\n\n### The Banach Space $B$\nLet's choose the Banach space $B$ to be the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value as the norm, i.e., $B = (\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)$. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $K = c$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n### Impossibility of Isometric Embedding\nNow, let's determine if an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ exists. If it does, there must be three points in $\\mathbb{R}$, let's call them $a = f(x_1)$, $b = f(x_2)$, and $c = f(x_3)$, that satisfy the following distance conditions:\n1.  $|a - b| = d(x_1, x_2) = 1$\n2.  $|b - c| = d(x_2, x_3) = 1$\n3.  $|a - c| = d(x_1, x_3) = 1$\n\nFrom condition (1), we have two possibilities: $a - b = 1$ or $a - b = -1$.\nFrom condition (2), we also have two possibilities: $b - c = 1$ or $b - c = -1$.\n\nLet's analyze the possible cases for the value of $a - c$:\n*   **Case 1:** $a - b = 1$ and $b - c = 1$. Adding these equations gives $(a - b) + (b - c) = 1 + 1$, which simplifies to $a - c = 2$.\n*   **Case 2:** $a - b = 1$ and $b - c = -1$. Adding these gives $a - c = 0$.\n*   **Case 3:** $a - b = -1$ and $b - c = 1$. Adding these gives $a - c = 0$.\n*   **Case 4:** $a - b = -1$ and $b - c = -1$. Adding these gives $a - c = -2$.\n\nIn all possible cases, the value of $|a - c|$ is either 2 or 0. None of these outcomes satisfies the third condition, $|a - c| = 1$. Therefore, it is impossible to find three points in $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the required distance relationships.\n\nThis means that for this specific choice of $X$ and $B$ (with cardinality $K=c$), there are no isometric embeddings. The number of such embeddings is 0.\n\n### General Conclusion\n\nThis example covers the case where the Banach space has cardinality $K=c$. A similar conclusion can be reached for the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$, which has cardinality $K=1$. For any finite ultrametric space $X$ with at least two points a distance $d(x_1, x_2) > 0$ apart, no embedding into $B=\\{0\\}$ is possible because $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = \\|0 - 0\\|_B = 0 \\neq d(x_1, x_2)$.\n\nSince the number of embeddings cannot be negative, and we have shown cases where the number is 0, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
