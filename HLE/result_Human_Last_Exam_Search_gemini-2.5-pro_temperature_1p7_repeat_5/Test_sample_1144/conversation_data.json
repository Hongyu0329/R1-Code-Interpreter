    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we first need to determine both of these values.\n\n**1. Momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):**\n\nAccording to the Bohr model of the atom, the angular momentum of an electron is quantized and is given by the equation L = nħ, where 'n' is the principal quantum number and 'ħ' is the reduced Planck constant. The angular momentum (L) is also defined as L = pr, where 'p' is the momentum and 'r' is the orbital radius.\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, n = 1. Thus, the momentum (p) can be expressed as:\np = ħ / r₁\n\nWhere:\n*   **ħ (Reduced Planck Constant)** ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   **r₁ (Radius of the first Bohr orbit)** ≈ 5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nCalculating the momentum:\np ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) / (5.292 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Uncertainty of the momentum (Δp):**\n\nThis is determined using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least ħ/2. The formula is:\nΔx · Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality:\nΔp = ħ / (2 · Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   **Δx (Uncertainty in position)** = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n\nCalculating the uncertainty in momentum:\nΔp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹²) ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum (Δp/p):**\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the two values:\nRatio = Δp / p ≈ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁴) / (1.992 x 10⁻²⁴) ≈ 2.646\n\nAlternatively, we can find the ratio by dividing the expressions for Δp and p:\nRatio = [ħ / (2 · Δx)] / [ħ / r₁] = r₁ / (2 · Δx)\nRatio = (5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m) = 5.292 / 2 = 2.646\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
