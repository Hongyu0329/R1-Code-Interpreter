    "In a 2008 guest performance in Novosibirsk, Siberia, while still a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, Natalia Osipova danced the role of Kitri in *Don Quixote*. Videos of her highly acclaimed performance in the Act I variation were once available online and widely shared amongst ballet enthusiasts.\n\nUnfortunately, functioning videos of this specific performance are no longer accessible online, with previously existing links now being defunct. While there are numerous accounts praising her technical abilities in this role during that period, and other performance videos from different years and acts exist, the precise number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in the 2008 Act I variation cannot be determined without visual confirmation from the original performance footage. Articles and discussions from that time highlight her \"daredeviltry, pyrotechnics, and flamboyance\" but do not provide a specific count of this particular ballet step.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number as a working video of the 2008 performance is not available.>>>"
