    "### Analysis of the System and Steady-State Calculation\n\nTo find the steady-state probabilities, denoted as $P_{i}(+\\infty)$, we analyze the system of equations as time $t$ approaches infinity. At this point, the probabilities become constant, meaning their derivatives with respect to time are zero. This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nThe provided Kolmogorov-Chapman system is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -0.019 \\cdot P_{0}(t) + 0.65 \\cdot P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -0.019 \\cdot P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4) \\cdot P_{1}(t) + 0.392 \\cdot P_{2}(t) + 0.008 \\cdot P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = 0.4 \\cdot P_{1}(t) - (0.392 + 0.008) \\cdot P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = 0.008 \\cdot P_{2}(t) - 0.008 \\cdot P_{3}(t)\n$$\nAnd the normalization condition:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\n\nA crucial observation is that a standard, closed Markov system requires the sum of the derivatives of the probabilities to be zero, consistent with the fact that the total probability is a constant (one). Summing the given differential equations yields:\n$d/dt \\sum P_i(t) = -0.038 \\cdot P_{0}(t)$.\nSince $d/dt(1) = 0$, this implies that $P_{0}(t)=0$ for all $t$. This would lead to a trivial solution where all probabilities are zero, which contradicts the normalization condition.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests a typographical error in the original problem statement. For a consistent Markov system representing transitions, the rate of flow into a state should be positive. It is highly likely that the second equation should have a positive sign for the term involving $P_{0}(t)$, representing the flow from state 0 to state 1.\n\n### Corrected System and Solution\n\nWith the corrected second equation, the system becomes:\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = +0.019 \\cdot P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4) \\cdot P_{1}(t) + 0.392 \\cdot P_{2}(t) + 0.008 \\cdot P_{3}(t)\n$$\nNow, the sum of the derivatives is zero, and the system is consistent.\n\nAt steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$), we set the derivatives to zero. Let $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. The system becomes:\n1.  $-0.019 \\cdot P_{0} + 0.65 \\cdot P_{1} = 0$\n2.  $0.4 \\cdot P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) \\cdot P_{2} = 0$\n3.  $0.008 \\cdot P_{2} - 0.008 \\cdot P_{3} = 0$\n4.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $P_{0}$, $P_{2}$, and $P_{3}$ in terms of $P_{1}$:\n*   From (1): $P_{0} = (0.65 / 0.019) \\cdot P_{1}$\n*   From (2): $0.4 \\cdot P_{1} - 0.4 \\cdot P_{2} = 0 \\implies P_{2} = P_{1}$\n*   From (3): $0.008 \\cdot P_{2} - 0.008 \\cdot P_{3} = 0 \\implies P_{3} = P_{2} = P_{1}$\n\nSubstituting these into the normalization equation (4):\n$$\n(0.65 / 0.019) \\cdot P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1\n$$\n$$\n((0.65 / 0.019) + 3) \\cdot P_{1} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $P_{1}$:\n$$\nP_{1} = 1 / ((0.65 / 0.019) + 3) = 0.019 / (0.65 + 3 \\cdot 0.019) = 0.019 / (0.65 + 0.057) = 0.019 / 0.707\n$$\nNow, we can find $P_{0}$:\n$$\nP_{0} = (0.65 / 0.019) \\cdot P_{1} = (0.65 / 0.019) \\cdot (0.019 / 0.707) = 0.65 / 0.707\n$$\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$:\n$$\nP_{0} + P_{1} = (0.65 / 0.707) + (0.019 / 0.707) = (0.65 + 0.019) / 0.707 = 0.669 / 0.707\n$$\nCalculating the final value:\n$$\nP_{0} + P_{1} \\approx 0.946251768\n$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$ is approximately 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
