    "Correctly identifying crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity requires a careful consideration of crystallographic symmetry rules.\n\nBased on crystallographic principles, the crystal classes that fit these specific criteria are:\n*   **4 (S4)**\n*   **42m (D2d)**\n\nHere is a breakdown of why these two classes are the correct answer:\n\n**Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active, it must not have a center of symmetry (it must be non-centrosymmetric). This property is the result of the crystal structure interacting with light in a way that rotates the plane of polarization. While often associated with chiral structures, optical activity is also possible in certain achiral crystal classes.\n\n**Achiral Crystal Classes:** A crystal is achiral if it can be superimposed on its mirror image. This means its symmetry includes operations of the \"second kind,\" such as a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis (an axis of improper rotation). There are four achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, 4, and 42m.\n\n**Non-Polar Crystal Classes:** A crystal class is considered polar if it possesses a unique crystallographic direction, meaning the two ends of this axis are not symmetrically equivalent. This allows for properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. Any crystal class not on this list is non-polar.\n\n**Identifying the Correct Classes:**\nBy cross-referencing the lists, we can find the crystal classes that meet all three conditions:\n*   They must be among the four optically active achiral classes: m, mm2, 4, and 42m.\n*   They must not be in the list of the 10 polar classes.\n\nAnalyzing the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   Crystal class **m** is polar.\n*   Crystal class **mm2** is polar.\n*   Crystal class **4** is **not** polar.\n*   Crystal class **42m** is **not** polar.\n\nTherefore, only crystal classes 4 and 42m satisfy all three requirements of being achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n<<<4 and 42m>>>"
