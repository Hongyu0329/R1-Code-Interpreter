    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph is 12344.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\nFirst, we establish an upper bound for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, of any such graph. Let $G$ be a graph with $n = 12345$ vertices. If $G$ is not a complete graph, it means there exists at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Since these two vertices are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper vertex coloring. We can color vertices $u$ and $v$ with a single color, and then assign a unique, new color to each of the remaining $n-2$ vertices. This procedure uses a total of $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors and results in a proper coloring. Therefore, the chromatic number of any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n-1$. For $n=12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nSecond, we show that this upper bound of $n-1$ can be achieved. To do this, we must construct a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete but requires $12344$ colors. Consider a graph $G^*$ created by taking a complete graph $K_{12344}$ (a graph with 12344 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex) and adding a single, isolated vertex. The total number of vertices in $G^*$ is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. This graph is not complete because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex. The subgraph $K_{12344}$ is a clique of size 12344, meaning all its vertices are mutually adjacent. Consequently, any proper coloring of $G^*$ must assign a distinct color to each of these 12344 vertices. This implies that the chromatic number of $G^*$ is at least 12344. Since we have already established that the chromatic number can be no more than 12344, we can conclude that $\\chi(G^*) = 12344$.\n\nThis demonstrates that the maximum number of colors required is precisely 12344. The reference to the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ in the question might bring to mind Brooks' Theorem, which states that for most connected graphs, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. However, the problem can be solved directly without this theorem, as shown above.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
