    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for modular subgroups depends on the specific family of congruence subgroups being considered. The notation in the question is non-standard, but a plausible interpretation is that \"maximum norm,\" denoted $(k_{k,\\infty})$, refers to the maximum cusp width of a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma$ of level $N$, where $N$ is a squarefree natural number, and $V$ is the covolume (the area of the fundamental domain) of the corresponding modular curve.\n\nHere are the bounds for the three most common families of congruence subgroups:\n\n### 1. For the Hecke Congruence Subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$\nThis is often the most standard case considered in many applications. For $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ being a squarefree integer:\n*   The **maximum cusp width** is $N$.\n*   The **covolume** is given by the formula $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N}(1+\\frac{1}{p})$, where the product is taken over the prime divisors of $N$.\n\nFrom this, we can derive an upper bound for $N$. Since the product term $\\prod_{p|N}(1+\\frac{1}{p})$ is always greater than 1, we have:\n$V > \\frac{\\pi}{3} N$\n\nThis directly leads to the linear upper bound:\n$N < \\frac{3V}{\\pi}$\n\n### 2. For the Congruence Subgroup $\\Gamma_1(N)$\nFor the subgroup $\\Gamma_1(N)$ with $N>2$ and squarefree:\n*   The **maximum cusp width** is also $N$.\n*   The **covolume** is $V = \\frac{\\pi}{6} N^2 \\prod_{p|N}(1-\\frac{1}{p^2})$.\n\nTo establish a bound, one can use the fact that the product term has a lower bound related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\prod_{p|N}(1-\\frac{1}{p^2}) > \\frac{1}{\\zeta(2)} = \\frac{6}{\\pi^2}$.\n$V > \\frac{\\pi}{6} N^2 \\left(\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}\\right) = \\frac{N^2}{\\pi}$\n\nThis results in the following upper bound:\n$N < \\sqrt{\\pi V}$\n\n### 3. For the Principal Congruence Subgroup $\\Gamma(N)$\nFor the principal congruence subgroup $\\Gamma(N)$ where $N$ is squarefree:\n*   The **maximum cusp width** is again $N$.\n*   The **covolume** is $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N^3 \\prod_{p|N}(1-\\frac{1}{p^2})$.\n\nUsing the same inequality for the product term as in the $\\Gamma_1(N)$ case:\n$V > \\frac{\\pi}{3} N^3 \\left(\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}\\right) = \\frac{2N^3}{\\pi}$\n\nThis gives the upper bound:\n$N < \\left(\\frac{\\pi V}{2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the maximum cusp width (interpreted as the \"maximum norm\") and the covolume is highly dependent on the specific congruence subgroup in question, with the upper bound for $N$ scaling differently with $V$ in each case. Without further context specifying the family of subgroups, the most common interpretation would likely refer to the $\\Gamma_0(N)$ case, which yields a linear bound.\n\n<<<The upper bound depends on the specific congruence subgroup. For the common choice of $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the upper bound is $N < \\frac{3V}{\\pi}$. For $\\Gamma_1(N)$, it is $N < \\sqrt{\\pi V}$, and for $\\Gamma(N)$, it is $N < (\\frac{\\pi V}{2})^{1/3}$.>>>"
