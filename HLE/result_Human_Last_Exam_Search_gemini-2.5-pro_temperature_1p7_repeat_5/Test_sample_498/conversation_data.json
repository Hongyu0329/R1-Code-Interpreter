    "This sequence puzzle is based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nThe letters Z, X, C, V, B, and N are the first six keys on the bottom row of the keyboard, read from left to right. Although your sequence `ZXXCVYBN` includes an extra \"X\" and a \"Y,\" these appear to be typos, as the core pattern follows the keyboard layout.\n\nFollowing this established keyboard pattern, the next letter after \"N\" on the bottom row is \"M\".\n\n<<<M>>>"
