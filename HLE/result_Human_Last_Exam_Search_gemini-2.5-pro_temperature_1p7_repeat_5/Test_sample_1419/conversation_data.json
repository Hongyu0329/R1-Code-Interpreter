    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is determined through the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d, with *d* being the spatial dimension.\n\nThe analysis begins with the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant, `u`, which describes how the coupling strength changes with the energy scale. The beta function in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u² + O(u³)\n\nThis equation includes a term proportional to `u`, arising from the classical scaling of the coupling, and a `u²` term from one-loop quantum corrections.\n\nA fixed point, denoted as u*, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling constant does not change with the energy scale. Setting β(u*) = 0 yields:\n\n-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions. The first, u* = 0, is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, corresponding to a free, non-interacting theory. The second, non-trivial solution is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. To find it, we can divide by u* (assuming u* ≠ 0):\n\n-ϵ + (3 / (16π²))u* = 0\n\nSolving for u* gives the leading order expression in terms of ϵ:\n\nu* = (16π² / 3)ϵ\n\nThis result is fundamental in the theory of critical phenomena, as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point governs the universal behavior of systems like the Ising model near its critical temperature in three dimensions (where ϵ = 1). Higher-order corrections to the fixed point coupling can be calculated and are expressed as a power series in ϵ.\n\nIt's important to note that the numerical factor depends on the normalization of the coupling constant `u`. The expression above corresponds to a Lagrangian density term of `(u / 4!)ϕ⁴`. Different conventions for this term would alter the constant of proportionality between u* and ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (16π² / 3)ϵ>>>"
