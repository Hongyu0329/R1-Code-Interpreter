    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The \"Manhattan lattice\" is another term for the square lattice. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks is a well-studied sequence in combinatorics.\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence number A001411. For n=10, the value provided is 44,100.\n\nHere are the first few terms of the sequence a(n):\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nThere is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for an arbitrary n, and the computation for larger values of n is a significant challenge.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
