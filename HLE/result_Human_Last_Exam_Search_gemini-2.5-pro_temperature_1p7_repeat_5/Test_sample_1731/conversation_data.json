    "The application of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, provides a rigorous mathematical framework for deriving the principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics. This approach allows for the calculation of equilibrium properties, such as entropy and mean energy, for physical systems like a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta).\n\nThe core idea is that the probability of a macroscopic system exhibiting a state other than its equilibrium state decays exponentially with the size of the system. The rate of this decay is described by a \"rate function\" or \"large deviation function,\" which is directly related to the system's entropy.\n\n### Derivation Outline:\n\n1.  **System Definition**: The system is a gas of photons in a cavity, which are bosons. The microstate of the system can be described by the number of photons (occupation numbers) in different energy levels.\n2.  **Large Deviation Principles**:\n    *   **Cramer's Theorem** (or the Cramer-Chernoff theorem in a more general form) is concerned with the large deviations of the sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In this context, the total energy of the gas can be viewed as the sum of the energies of individual photons. The theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of the average energy deviating from its expected value.\n    *   **Sanov's Theorem** deals with the large deviations of the empirical measure (or distribution) of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. For the photon gas, this corresponds to the distribution of photons across different energy levels. The theorem states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution `q` when the true distribution is `p` is approximately `exp(-N * D(q||p))`, where `N` is the number of particles and `D(q||p)` is the Kullback-Leibler divergence or relative entropy between the two distributions.\n\n3.  **Finding the Equilibrium Distribution**:\n    *   Equilibrium is the most probable state of the system. According to the large deviation framework, the most probable state is the one that minimizes the rate function (or maximizes the entropy).\n    *   By applying these theorems and maximizing the statistical weight (the number of ways to arrange the photons) subject to the constraint of a fixed total average energy, we arrive at the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number `<n_ν>` of a state with energy `hν`:\n\n        `<n_ν> = 1 / (exp(βhν) - 1)`\n\n        Here, `β = 1/(kT)` is the inverse temperature, `k` is the Boltzmann's constant, `h` is Planck's constant, and `ν` is the photon frequency. For a photon gas, the chemical potential is zero because the number of photons is not conserved.\n\n4.  **Calculating Mean Energy and Entropy**:\n    *   **Mean Energy**: The mean energy `U` of the photon gas is found by summing the energy of all possible modes, weighted by the Bose-Einstein distribution. To do this, one must also calculate the density of states `g(ν)`, which represents the number of available modes per unit frequency interval in a given volume `V`. The density of states is given by `g(ν)dν = (8πV/c^3)ν^2dν`.\n\n        The mean energy `U` is then the integral of the energy per mode `hν` times the number of photons in that mode `<n_ν>` over all frequencies:\n\n        `U = ∫ hν * <n_ν> * g(ν) dν = (8πhV/c^3) ∫ (ν^3 / (exp(hν/kT) - 1)) dν`\n\n        Solving this integral leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy:\n\n        `U = (8π^5 k^4 / 15c^3 h^3) * V * T^4`\n\n    *   **Entropy**: The entropy `S` is derived from the statistical weight associated with the Bose-Einstein distribution. It can be calculated using the principles of statistical mechanics, where the entropy is related to the logarithm of the partition function. The resulting entropy for a photon gas is:\n\n        `S = (32π^5 k^4 / 45c^3 h^3) * V * T^3`\n\nThese expressions represent the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas. The derivation through large deviation theorems provides a formal justification for the methods of statistical mechanics and reproduces the results first obtained by Bose and Planck.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (U):**\n`U = (8π^5 k^4 / 15c^3 h^3) * V * T^4`\n\n**Entropy (S):**\n`S = (32π^5 k^4 / 45c^3 h^3) * V * T^3`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n*   `k` is Boltzmann's constant.\n*   `h` is Planck's constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n>>>"
