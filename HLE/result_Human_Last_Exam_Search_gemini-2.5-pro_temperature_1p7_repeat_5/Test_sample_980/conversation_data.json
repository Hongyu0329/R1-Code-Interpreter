    "This is a particularly tricky number sequence. Searches in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and general web queries did not yield a direct match for this specific sequence. This suggests that it is not a standard, well-documented mathematical sequence.\n\nHowever, an analysis of the numbers reveals a strong correlation with the bus service numbers in Singapore, operated by SBS Transit. Nearly all the numbers in the sequence correspond to existing bus routes. This suggests that the sequence may have a non-mathematical origin, possibly related to a journey or a series of observations of bus routes.\n\nWithout further context, it is not possible to definitively determine the next number in the sequence based on a real-world logic (like a bus transfer). However, we can analyze the internal structure of the sequence for patterns, particularly at the end.\n\nThe sequence ends with: ..., 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nLet's look at the repetitions at the end of the sequence:\n*   Three occurrences of the number 36 (`36, 36, 36`)\n*   Followed by three occurrences of the number 124 (`124, 124, 124`)\n*   Followed by a single occurrence of the number 36 (`36`)\n*   Followed by a single occurrence of the number 124 (`124`)\n\nThis creates a pattern in the number of repetitions: a pair of numbers (36 and 124) is repeated three times each, and then the same pair is repeated one time each.\n\nOne possible interpretation is that the pattern of (A, B) pairs will continue. If the sequence of repetition counts is, for example, `(3,3), (1,1)`, a plausible next step would be the start of a new pattern. A reasonable assumption is that the pattern might restart with the number 36.\n\nBased on this analysis of the most recent numbers in the sequence, the next number is likely to be 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
