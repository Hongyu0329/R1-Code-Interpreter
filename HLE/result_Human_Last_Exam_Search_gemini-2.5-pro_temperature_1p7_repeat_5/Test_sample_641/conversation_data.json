    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4,q) is a known result in finite group theory. For an odd prime power q, PSU(4,q) has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. The sizes of these classes can be calculated using formulas derived from the group's structure.\n\nFor a given odd `q`, the number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes:\n*   The size of the first class of involutions is `q^2 * (q^2 + 1)`.\n*   The size of the second class of involutions is `(q^3 * (q^2 - 1)) / 2`.\n\nTherefore, the total number of involutions is given by the formula: `N = q^2 * (q^2 + 1) + (q^3 * (q^2 - 1)) / 2`.\n\nFor the specific case of PSU(4, 997), we substitute `q = 997` into this formula.\n\n1.  **Calculate the size of the first class:**\n    *   `997^2 * (997^2 + 1) = 994009 * (994009 + 1) = 994009 * 994010 = 988,044,734,090`\n\n2.  **Calculate the size of the second class:**\n    *   `(997^3 * (997^2 - 1)) / 2 = (991026973 * 994008) / 2 = 985088739377784 / 2 = 492,544,369,688,892`\n\n3.  **Sum the sizes of the two classes:**\n    *   `988,044,734,090 + 492,544,369,688,892 = 493,532,414,422,982`\n\nThus, the total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is 493,532,414,422,982.\n\n<<<493532414422982>>>"
