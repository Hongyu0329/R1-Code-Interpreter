    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community. It is often denoted as *S(q, ω)*, where *q* represents the momentum transfer (the Fourier variable for space) and *ω* represents the energy transfer (the Fourier variable for time).\n\nThe dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity in nuclear engineering and physics because it describes how a system of particles, such as the nuclei in a moderator material, scatters neutrons both in terms of the angle (related to momentum transfer) and the energy exchange. This information is essential for accurately modeling neutron transport and moderation in nuclear systems, which is a fundamental aspect of nuclear criticality safety analysis.\n\nIn the context of thermal neutron scattering, which is of paramount importance in the moderation process within nuclear reactors, the dynamic structure factor is directly related to the double-differential scattering cross-section. This cross-section provides the probability that a neutron of a certain energy will scatter into a particular direction with a specific final energy. Experimental data on inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe the dynamic structure factor of materials.\n\nWithin the nuclear data community, a dimensionless form of the dynamic structure factor, known as the **thermal scattering law**, *S(α, β)*, is often used. Here, α and β are dimensionless variables corresponding to momentum and energy transfer, respectively. This formulation is convenient for use in nuclear data libraries that are employed by neutron transport codes, such as MCNP, to perform criticality calculations. Therefore, while \"dynamic structure factor\" is the fundamental physical quantity, \"thermal scattering law\" is the practical implementation of this concept for reactor and criticality safety calculations.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
