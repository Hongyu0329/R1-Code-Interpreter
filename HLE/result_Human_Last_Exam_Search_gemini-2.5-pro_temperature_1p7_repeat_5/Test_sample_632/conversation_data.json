    "Until 1928, the fountain in the Piazza della Rotonda was enclosed by a distinctive set of colonnettes and fences. This architectural feature, which surrounded the basin of the fountain, was removed by the city administration, altering the immediate appearance and accessibility of the famous landmark.\n\nThe fountain itself, known as the Fontana del Pantheon, was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1575. Over the centuries, it underwent various modifications. One of the most significant was the addition of the Egyptian obelisk in 1711 under Pope Clement XI. The removal of the colonnettes and fences in 1928 was another key alteration to the fountain's design and the overall character of the piazza.\n\nWhile your inquiry specified the year 1950, historical records point to this significant change occurring in 1928. It is possible the memory of this event persisted, with the exact year becoming less precise over time. Earlier, in 1662, an outer balustrade and steps were also removed when the level of the square was lowered. Other notable changes to the piazza's architecture throughout its history include the demolition of medieval shops and sheds in the 15th century and the removal of twin bell towers from the Pantheon itself in the late 19th century.\n\n<<<the colonnettes and fences that surrounded the fountain>>>"
