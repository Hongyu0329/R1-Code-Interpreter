    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least four distinct colors: white, red, violet, and black. These primary colors can also have variations in their appearance.\n\nThe main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear white or colorless. Due to the presence of impurities or exposure to light, it often has a yellowish hue and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** As its name suggests, this allotrope is red. Its color can range from orange-red to a deep red or reddish-violet powder.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. It can also appear grey with a metallic luster.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is violet in color. It has also been described as having a red/purple form. Some sources note it can appear as yellowish-red translucent plates or have a steely blue luster.\n\nIn addition to these, there is mention of blue phosphorus, although detailed information on its observable color is less common in the provided search results. Another form, diphosphorus, exists as a gas.\n\nBased on the distinct and observable colors of the well-established solid allotropes, one can identify at least four main color categories: white (including colorless and yellow), red (including orange-red), black (including grey), and violet (including purple and blue hues).\n\n<<<4>>>"
