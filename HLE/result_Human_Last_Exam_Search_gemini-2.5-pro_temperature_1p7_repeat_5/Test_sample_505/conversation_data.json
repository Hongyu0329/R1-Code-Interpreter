    "In two patches of surface code, each with two holes, a maximum of 4 logical qubits can be encoded.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this is determined:\n\n*   **Encoding with Holes:** In the surface code, a standard patch of physical qubits without any defects typically encodes a single logical qubit. To encode multiple logical qubits on a single surface, one common method is to create \"holes\" or \"defects\" by disabling some of the stabilizer measurements.\n\n*   **One Qubit per Hole:** For a standard planar surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is directly related to the number of independent holes created. A surface code with two closed holes can encode two logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code containing two holes can encode at most 2 logical qubits.\n\n*   **Total for Two Patches:** Since each of the two patches has two holes, and each patch can consequently encode 2 logical qubits, the total maximum number of logical qubits is the sum from both patches: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nIt is worth noting that while creating a pair of holes is often discussed as a method to encode a single logical qubit, from the perspective of maximum encoding capacity in a straightforward configuration, each independent closed hole allows for the encoding of one logical qubit.\n\n<<<4>>>"
