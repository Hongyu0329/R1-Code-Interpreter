    "The two Nobel laureates connected to the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign were Paul Krugman and Merton Miller. While there is no evidence that they were featured in the commercials themselves, their association with the company during that period has been documented.\n\nPaul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, served on a paid advisory board for Enron in 1999. He has stated that he resigned from the board upon joining The New York Times due to the newspaper's conflict-of-interest rules. His involvement with the company has been a subject of scrutiny.\n\nMerton Miller, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990, was a known advocate for the deregulation of the derivatives market, a key area of Enron's business. He participated in a roundtable discussion in 1999 where he supported political efforts to weaken regulations on financial derivatives, which was beneficial to Enron. Miller passed away in June 2000.\n\nEnron's \"Ask Why\" slogan was part of a broader advertising campaign that began in 1999 to portray the company as an innovative and forward-thinking leader.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
