    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**, with a peak elevation of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet).\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in the ancient epic, playing significant roles as settings for divine intervention and as geographical landmarks. The search for the tallest among these, excluding the mythical home of the gods, Mount Olympus, reveals a close contest.\n\nThe mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and their respective heights are:\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** Located in central Greece, it is the highest among the historically mentioned mountains in the epic, standing at 2,457 meters. In ancient times, it was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.\n*   **Mount Ida in Crete:** This mountain, the highest on the island of Crete, has an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). According to mythology, it was the birthplace of Zeus.\n*   **Mount Ida in Turkey (Kaz Dağı):** Situated in modern-day Turkey near the site of ancient Troy, this Mount Ida has an elevation of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). It was from this mountain that the gods, particularly Zeus, were said to have watched the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Othrys:** A mountain range in central Greece, its highest peak reaches 1,726 meters (5,663 feet). In Greek mythology, it was the stronghold of the Titans.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, its highest summit is 1,624 meters (5,328 ft). It was known in mythology as the home of the Centaurs.\n\nWhile Mount Ida in Crete is nearly as tall as Mount Parnassus, the latter holds the distinction of being the highest of these historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
