    "According to analyses of the Terraria source code by the game's community, there is no theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. As the number of players approaches infinity, the boss's health increases without bound.\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu starts with a base health of 3,640 for a single player. The health then scales upwards with each additional player in the game.\n\nThe health scaling follows a specific, multi-tiered formula:\n*   **For two players**, the health is increased by 35% of the base single-player health.\n*   **From three to nine players**, the amount of health added for each new player increases. This means the third player adds a larger amount of health than the second, and the fourth adds more than the third, and so on.\n*   **For ten or more players**, the rate of health increase is somewhat reduced, but it continues to grow with every additional player.\n\nBecause the health bonus per player does not diminish to zero and instead trends towards a significant value, the total health of the Eye of Cthulhu will continue to rise indefinitely as more players are added. Therefore, with a theoretical infinite number of players, the health would also be infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
