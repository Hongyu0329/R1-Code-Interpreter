    "Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD) was the first Christian theologian to develop a specialized terminology to describe apparent changes in the laws of nature, a framework applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in the natural order at the Fall.\n\nAugustine's key insight was to argue that miracles are not violations of the natural order, but are events that happen \"contrary to what is *known* of nature\" (*contra quam est nota natura*). For Augustine, the will of God is the ultimate law of nature, so nothing that God wills can truly be \"unnatural.\"\n\nTo explain how seemingly impossible events could occur, he developed the concept of **seminal reasons** (*rationes seminales* or *causales*). Augustine proposed that God embedded these \"seeds\" of potentiality within creation from the very beginning. The regular, predictable course of nature unfolds according to the more obvious seminal reasons.\n\nA miracle, such as the virgin birth, occurs when God activates a hidden or \"latent\" seminal reason that has existed in creation since the beginning. This was not a suspension of nature, but the unfolding of a deeper, pre-ordained potentiality whose cause is hidden in God. This framework allows for events that appear to break natural laws while maintaining that God is not acting against the consistent order He himself created.\n\nThis same theological toolkit can be applied to the changes in natural laws following the Fall of Man. The introduction of decay, toil, and pain could be understood not as a violation of the original \"good\" nature, but as the activation of different, negative potentialities that were always possible within creation after being corrupted by sin.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
