The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a number but a set of defining rules. For a single Grassmann variable θ, these rules are ∫ dθ = 0 and ∫ dθ θ = 1. These rules, in conjunction with the property that Grassmann variables square to zero (θ² = 0), enforce the Pauli exclusion principle.
