The primary interaction site on the beta-1 subunit is the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. Hotspots for interaction are the hydrophobic residues that form this pocket, with specific leucine quartets being crucial for functional modulation. For gating modulation, key hotspots include residues at the interface of the SH3 and GK domains that maintain a specific structural configuration, surface-charged residues that allow for fine-tuning of electrostatic interactions, and residues within the variable N- and C-terminal regions and the HOOK domain that can be post-translationally modified.
