    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of maximal tori defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This number is in one-to-one correspondence with the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any simple algebraic group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is of the split form. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. In this case, the $F$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$. The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed by R. Carter in 1972.\n\nAccording to Carter's classification, the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
