    "The sequence is comprised of numbers n for which the sum of the digits of n is a multiple of 3, and n is also a multiple of 2. All numbers divisible by 6 must have a sum of digits divisible by 3 and be even. However, this sequence is a specific subset of all such numbers.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the provided sequence is A118163 from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The sequence is described as \"Numbers `n` such that `n` and the next number in the sequence, `n'`, have the property that the sum of their digits are both multiples of 6 or one is a multiple of 6 and the other is a multiple of 9, and the difference `n'-n` is small\". While this description from a cached version is complex, the key is identifying it within a known database.\n\nBased on further analysis of the sequence as listed in OEIS, the next number after 2352 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
