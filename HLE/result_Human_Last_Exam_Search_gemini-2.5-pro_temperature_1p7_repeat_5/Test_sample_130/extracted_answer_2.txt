As the local median function is applied iteratively to the pixel values of a binary black and white image, the edges of the image, which are the boundaries between the black and white regions, undergo a geometric evolution. This process has several key effects. Firstly, the edges become progressively smoother, with noise and small, jagged features being removed. Secondly, sharp corners are rounded off; convex corners are eroded while concave corners are filled in. This leads to the third major effect: the overall shapes of the black and white regions tend to become convex. Small, isolated regions of one color within a larger region of the other color will shrink and eventually disappear. This iterative process converges to a stable, fixed-point image. In this final state, the edges are smooth boundaries separating convex regions of black and white.
