    "Based on a detailed analysis of the molecular formula and the ¹³C NMR spectrum, the IUPAC name of the compound is 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** The formula indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either a double bond or a ring.\n*   **¹³C NMR Chemical Shifts:**\n    *   The signals at **145 ppm (s)** and **112 ppm (t)** are characteristic of carbons in a double bond. The `(s)` indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom bonded to four other atoms other than hydrogen, >C=) and the `(t)` indicates a methylene group (=CH₂), confirming the presence of a `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n    *   The remaining signals at **48 ppm (t)**, **27 ppm (d)**, **22 ppm (q)**, and **21 ppm (q)** correspond to aliphatic carbons: a CH₂ group, a CH group, and two non-equivalent CH₃ groups, respectively.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The molecule has seven carbon atoms, but only six distinct signals are observed in the NMR spectrum. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are in chemically identical environments and thus produce a single overlapping signal. The multiplicities of the signals (s, d, t, t, q, q) and the fragments derived from them (>C=CH₂, -CH₂-, -CH-, and three CH₃ groups) lead to a unique structure. The fragments can be assembled as an ethyl group and an isopropyl group attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` moiety. In this structure, the two methyl groups of the isopropyl substituent are chemically equivalent, which accounts for the observation of only six signals for a seven-carbon molecule.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** The derived structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-C(CH₂CH₃)=CH₂`. When naming this compound according to IUPAC rules, the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond is selected. This results in a butene backbone with an ethyl group on the second carbon and a methyl group on the third carbon. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
