The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ D[ψ̅]D[ψ] e⁻ˢᵘᵇ⁽ᴱ⁾, where the integral is a functional integral over anti-periodic Grassmann fields ψ(τ, **x**) and ψ̅(τ, **x**) (i.e., ψ(β, **x**) = -ψ(0, **x**)). The term Sₑ is the Euclidean action, defined as Sₑ = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̅(τ, **x**) (ħ∂/∂τ + H) ψ(τ, **x**), with β being the inverse temperature and H being the Hamiltonian operator.
