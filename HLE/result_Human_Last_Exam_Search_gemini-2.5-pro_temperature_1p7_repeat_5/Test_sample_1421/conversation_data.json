    "The formula for the fermionic partition function, denoted as Z, in the imaginary time representation utilizing Feynman’s path integral formalism is a cornerstone of quantum field theory at finite temperatures. It involves integration over anti-commuting fields known as Grassmann variables, reflecting the anti-symmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions.\n\nThe partition function Z is expressed as a functional integral over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields, ψ and its conjugate ψ̅, that satisfy specific boundary conditions. The general formula is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ̅]D[ψ] e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̅, ψ]</sup>**\n\nWhere:\n*   **∫ D[ψ̅]D[ψ]** represents the functional integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields ψ(τ, **x**) and ψ̅(τ, **x**).\n*   **e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub></sup>** is the Boltzmann weight, determined by the Euclidean action.\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̅, ψ]** is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system, formulated in imaginary time. It is defined as:\n    **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̅, ψ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ̅(τ, **x**) (ħ∂/∂τ + H) ψ(τ, **x**)**\n\nThe key components of this formalism are:\n\n*   **Imaginary Time (τ):** The formalism employs a Wick rotation, substituting real time *t* with imaginary time τ = i*t*. The integration in the action is performed over the interval [0, β], where β = 1/k<sub>B</sub>T, with T being the temperature and k<sub>B</sub> the Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Grassmann Variables (ψ, ψ̅):** To correctly describe fermions, which obey the Pauli exclusion principle, the fields are represented by anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables. This means that for any two such variables, θ₁ and θ₂, their product satisfies θ₁θ₂ = -θ₂θ₁.\n*   **Euclidean Action (S<sub>E</sub>):** This is the classical action of the system expressed in imaginary time. *H* represents the single-particle Hamiltonian operator, which includes kinetic and potential energy terms.\n*   **Anti-periodic Boundary Conditions:** A crucial feature for fermions is the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This means the fields must satisfy ψ(τ + β, **x**) = -ψ(τ, **x**) and ψ̅(τ + β, **x**) = -ψ̅(τ, **x**). These boundary conditions ensure that the trace operation is correctly performed in the quantum statistical mechanics framework and that the resulting theory adheres to Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\nFor a non-interacting system where the Hamiltonian has eigenstates with energies ε<sub>λ</sub>, the path integral can be evaluated exactly, yielding the partition function as a product over all single-particle states:\n\n**Z = Π<sub>λ</sub> (1 + e<sup>-βε<sub>λ</sub></sup>)**\n\nThis result is the well-known partition function for an ideal Fermi gas, demonstrating the power and correctness of the path integral formalism.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ D[ψ̅]D[ψ] e⁻ˢᵘᵇ⁽ᴱ⁾, where the integral is a functional integral over anti-periodic Grassmann fields ψ(τ, **x**) and ψ̅(τ, **x**) (i.e., ψ(β, **x**) = -ψ(0, **x**)). The term Sₑ is the Euclidean action, defined as Sₑ = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̅(τ, **x**) (ħ∂/∂τ + H) ψ(τ, **x**), with β being the inverse temperature and H being the Hamiltonian operator.>>>"
