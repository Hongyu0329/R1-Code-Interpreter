    "The island town that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing the town's name and is located more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island is **Hanga Roa** on **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**.\n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, over 2,000 kilometers away, thus satisfying the isolation criteria.\n\nThe island's capital and main settlement is Hanga Roa. The town is situated on the west coast, on a bay that is also named Hanga Roa, which means \"long bay\" in the Rapa Nui language. The island itself is of volcanic origin, formed by three extinct volcanoes. Hanga Roa is located in the lowlands between two of these volcanoes, Terevaka and Rano Kau, with the latter featuring a large and well-defined caldera.\n\nWhile Hanga Roa is not situated directly inside a contained caldera in the way some other volcanic towns are, the bay on which it lies is an indentation on the coast of a volcanic island, framed by the volcanic landscape.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa, Easter Island>>>"
