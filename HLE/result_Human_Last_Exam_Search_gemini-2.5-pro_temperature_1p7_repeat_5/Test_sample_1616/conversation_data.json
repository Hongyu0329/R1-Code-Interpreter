    "Of the words listed, `shadow` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a long, tense vowel becomes a short, lax vowel when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word (the antepenultimate syllable). This phonological rule typically applies when a suffix is added to a root word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **southern**: This word underwent trisyllabic laxing historically. Its Old English and Middle English ancestor, *sūtherne*, had three syllables. The long vowel in the root word *sūth* (south) was shortened because it was followed by two syllables.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in the related word *derive* changes to a lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative* because the syllable is now the third from the end.\n*   **serenity**: This word also clearly demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The long, tense vowel /iː/ in the word *serene* becomes a short, lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*.\n*   **pleasant**: This two-syllable word was borrowed from Old French *plaisant* and was not formed in English in a way that would trigger trisyllabic laxing. It doesn't have the required three-syllable structure for the rule to apply.\n*   **gratitude**: This is another textbook case. The tense vowel sound /eɪ/ found in the related word *grateful* (from the root *grate*) becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in the trisyllabic word *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: While the vowel in *shadow* (/ˈʃædoʊ/) is lax compared to its corresponding root word *shade* (/ʃeɪd/), this change is an example of a different process, often called disyllabic or pre-cluster shortening, not trisyllabic laxing. Since *shadow* has only two syllables, the rule for trisyllabic laxing does not apply.\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" are disyllabic and therefore not subject to trisyllabic laxing. However, \"shadow\" is part of a known pattern of vowel laxing (`shade` -> `shadow`), but it is specifically a non-trisyllabic one. \"Pleasant\" does not exhibit this type of derivational vowel change within English. In the context of English phonology, `shadow` is a prime example of a word that underwent a different kind of laxing, thus explicitly not *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
