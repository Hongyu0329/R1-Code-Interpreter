    "There are no ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. The number of ways is 0.\n\nA comment on a mathematics discussion forum by a user who explored this specific problem indicated that while four queens could be placed in two non-attacking groups, it is not possible to place them as four individually non-attacking queens. The problem of placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is known to have solutions only when the greatest common divisor of *n* and 6 is 1. While this condition applies to placing 5 queens on a 5x5 board, it does not guarantee a solution for placing fewer than *n* queens. The enumeration of placements for *k* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is a complex combinatorial problem, and for the specific case of 4 queens on a 5x5 board, the number of valid arrangements is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
