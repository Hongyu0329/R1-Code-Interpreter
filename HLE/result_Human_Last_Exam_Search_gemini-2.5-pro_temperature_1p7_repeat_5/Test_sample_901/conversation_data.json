    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The name of the product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: The use of potassium tert-butoxide, a strong and sterically bulky base, with a secondary alkyl halide favors a bimolecular elimination (E2) reaction pathway.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Requirement of E2 Reactions**: A critical requirement for an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring is that the hydrogen atom to be removed and the leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) must be in an *anti-periplanar* or *trans-diaxial* arrangement. This means that both the hydrogen and the bromine must be in axial positions, oriented 180Â° from each other.\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis of the Reactant**:\n    *   The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans* isomer.\n    *   For the E2 reaction to proceed, the bromine atom must be in an axial position. In the chair conformation where bromine is axial, the trans-oriented methyl group at the adjacent carbon must also be in an axial position to maintain the trans relationship.\n    *   This all-axial conformation is less stable than the conformation where both the bromine and methyl groups are equatorial. However, the molecule must adopt this less stable conformation for the elimination reaction to happen.\n\n4.  **Identification of Removable Protons**: With the bromine atom in an axial position on carbon-1, the base can only remove a beta-hydrogen that is also in an axial position on an adjacent carbon (carbon-2 or carbon-6).\n    *   **At carbon-2**: The methyl group occupies the axial position. Therefore, the hydrogen on carbon-2 is in an equatorial position and cannot be removed via an E2 mechanism because it is not anti-periplanar to the bromine. Consequently, the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene), known as the Zaitsev product, cannot be formed.\n    *   **At carbon-6**: This carbon has a hydrogen atom in the axial position which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n\n5.  **Product Formation**: The bulky potassium tert-butoxide base abstracts the axial hydrogen from carbon-6. Simultaneously, the carbon-hydrogen bond breaks, a double bond forms between carbon-1 and carbon-6, and the bromide ion leaves. This regioselectivity leads exclusively to the formation of the less substituted alkene, **3-methylcyclohexene**, which is known as the Hofmann product. This outcome is dictated by the strict stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction mechanism in cyclic systems.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
