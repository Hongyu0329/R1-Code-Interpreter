    "The question of which achiral and non-polar crystal classes possess the correct symmetry for optical activity is a nuanced one that delves into the precise definitions of these crystallographic properties.\n\nIn general, optical activity—the rotation of the plane of polarized light—is a hallmark of chiral structures. Chirality is defined by the absence of any improper rotation symmetry elements, such as a center of inversion or mirror planes. Crystals that lack a center of symmetry are termed non-centrosymmetric. While all chiral crystal classes are non-centrosymmetric, not all non-centrosymmetric classes are chiral.\n\nThe crucial factor for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be non-centrosymmetric. This requirement includes all 11 chiral crystal classes but also extends to a specific set of 10 achiral classes. The question, therefore, focuses on identifying which of these achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes are also non-polar.\n\nA polar crystal class is one that has a unique directional axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. An analysis of the non-centrosymmetric crystal classes reveals that certain achiral classes can indeed exhibit optical activity. Recent research confirms that four specific achiral (nonenantiomorphic) crystal classes are known to be optically active: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. Experiments have confirmed this phenomenon in crystals with these symmetries, such as silver thiogallate (-42m).\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for classes that are both **achiral and non-polar**. We must examine this set of optically active achiral classes for polarity:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are polar classes.\n*   **-4** and **-42m** are non-polar classes.\n\nLooking further into the properties of non-centrosymmetric classes, the following are identified as being achiral and non-polar: **-4**, **-42m**, **-6**, **-6m2 (also written as -62m)**, and **-43m**. These classes lack a center of symmetry, which permits optical activity, but possess other symmetry elements (like rotoinversion axes) that make them achiral. They are also non-polar, meaning they lack a unique polar axis.\n\nComparing this derived list with the provided answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are achiral but polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are all achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are achiral but polar.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: While these are achiral and non-polar, this list is not as complete as choice B.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral crystal classes.\n\nTherefore, the group that correctly identifies achiral and non-polar crystal classes with the appropriate symmetry for optical activity is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
