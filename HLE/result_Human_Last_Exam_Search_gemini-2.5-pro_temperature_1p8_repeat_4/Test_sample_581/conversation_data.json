    "Based on the available research, the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in the affine space of dimension 8 over the field of 3 elements, denoted AG(8,3), is 496. This value is documented in a 2018 paper which presents a table of the best-known lower and upper bounds for the size of maximal 1-caps in F<sup>n</sup><sub>3</sub> for dimensions up to n=10. For dimension n=8, the established lower bound is listed as 496.\n\nWhile there has been mention of a larger cap of size 541 in the projective space PG(8,3), this does not directly translate to a lower bound for the affine space AG(8,3) in the context of commonly cited records for the affine cap set problem, as evidenced by dedicated tables of bounds for the affine case. The research community focused on AG(n,3) continues to reference specific values for lower dimensions, and for n=8, the widely recognized lower bound remains 496.\n\nTherefore, among the given choices, 496 is the correct and best-established lower bound.\n\n<<<F>>>"
