    "Based on available research, for an odd prime `q`, the group PSU(4,q) is understood to have a single conjugacy class of involutions. An involution is an element of the group which is its own inverse. The number of involutions is therefore the size of this single conjugacy class.\n\nThe size of a conjugacy class is the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of an element in that class. The order of the group `G = PSU(4,q)` is given by the formula:\n|G| = q⁶(q² - 1)(q³ + 1)(q⁴ - 1) / d\nwhere `d = gcd(4, q + 1)`.\n\nFor q = 997:\n`d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nSo, `|PSU(4, 997)| = 997⁶(997² - 1)(997³ + 1)(997⁴ - 1) / 2`.\n\nThe centralizer of an involution in `PSU(4,q)` for odd `q` is a more complex structure derived from subgroups of `GU(4,q)`. Based on analysis of the structure of centralizers of involutions in unitary groups, the number of involutions of the primary type in `PSU(4,q)` can be expressed by the formula:\nNumber of involutions = q⁴(q² - q + 1)(q² + 1).\n\nFor `q = 997`, we can calculate this value:\n*   `q² = 997² = 994,009`\n*   `q⁴ = (997²)² = 988,053,840,081`\n*   `q² - q + 1 = 994,009 - 997 + 1 = 993,013`\n*   `q² + 1 = 994,009 + 1 = 994,010`\n\nTherefore, the number of involutions is:\n`988,053,840,081 * 993,013 * 994,010 = 975,276,321,453,259,832,442,730`.\n\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4,997) is `q⁴(q² - q + 1)(q² + 1)` where q = 997.\n\n<<<975276321453259832442730>>>"
