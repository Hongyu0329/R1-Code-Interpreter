    "A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane of a dynamical system that separates trajectories with different qualitative behaviors. Often, these are the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points, as these manifolds form boundaries between basins of attraction.\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points of the system by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$:\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t) = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d = 2d^2+2d = 2d(d+1)=0$, which gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(0,1)$ and $(-1,1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of these points by linearizing the system. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d -2u^2 + 3u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   At $(-1, 1)$: $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, this point is a saddle point.\n*   At $(0, 1)$: $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, this is an unstable node (a source).\n*   At $(0, 0)$: $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive.\n\nSeparatrices are often the invariant manifolds of saddle points. In this system, we have a saddle point at $(-1,1)$. We look for an invariant curve passing through this point. An invariant curve is a trajectory of the system. Let's test for a simple analytical solution of the form $d=f(u)$. By substituting potential solutions into the trajectory equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$, we can test for an exact solution.\n\nLet's test the curve $d(u) = -u^2$.\nThe derivative with respect to time is $d' = -2u u'$. We substitute this and $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n$-2u u' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3 + u^4$\nAnd we use the second equation, $u' = u^3-u^2$:\n$-2u(u^3-u^2) = 2u^4 -5u^4+3u^3 - u^3+u^4$\n$-2u^4+2u^3 = -2u^4+2u^3$\nThis equation is an identity, which means that $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution curve (an invariant manifold) for the system.\n\nLet's verify if this curve corresponds to one of the manifolds of the saddle point $(-1,1)$.\n*   The curve $d = -u^2$ passes through $(-1,1)$, since for $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$.\n*   The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$.\n*   The unstable manifold of the saddle $(-1,1)$ is tangent to the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_2=1$. The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope is $\\frac{du}{dd} = \\frac{1}{-2}$, which means $\\frac{dd}{du}=-2$.\n\nSince the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point and its slope at that point matches the slope of the unstable manifold, we conclude that the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$. Unstable manifolds of saddle points are key separatrices in phase space. This curve connects the saddle point $(-1,1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. For $u \\in (0,1)$, we have $u' = (u-1)u^2 < 0$, so the trajectory along the curve moves from $(-1,1)$ towards $(0,0)$.\n\nThis invariant curve $d = -u^2$ acts as a boundary. Trajectories starting on one side of this curve will follow a different long-term behavior than trajectories starting on the other side. Therefore, it is the separatrix of the system.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
