A pharmacist would advise Allison that her headache is a common side effect of her medications (Atorvastatin, Junel Fe, and Fluoxetine). The smell of seawater is an unusual symptom called phantosmia, which could be a rare medication side effect, related to a possible sinus infection from her recent cruise, or part of a migraine aura. The pharmacist would recommend she use Excedrin for her headache but be aware of the increased risk of bleeding due to its aspirin content in combination with her fluoxetine. It would be most important for Allison to schedule an appointment with her doctor to discuss these new symptoms to determine the underlying cause and the best course of action. She should not discontinue any of her prescribed medications without medical advice.
