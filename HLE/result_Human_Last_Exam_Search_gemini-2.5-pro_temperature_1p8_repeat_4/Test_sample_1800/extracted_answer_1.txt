The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is application-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a lower nickel content (e.g., around 7% molar Ni or 5-12.5 wt% Ni) is often optimal. For water splitting, a higher Ni content (e.g., Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 or 1:1) is favorable for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction, while a lower ratio (e.g., 1:2) is better for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.
