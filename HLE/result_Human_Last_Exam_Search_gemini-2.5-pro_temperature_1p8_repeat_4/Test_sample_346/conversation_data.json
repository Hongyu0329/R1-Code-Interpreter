    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to find the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression. The process involves reducing the expression to a simpler, recognizable form.\n\nThe given expression is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nFirst, let's identify and simplify the component combinators:\n1.  The combinator `B` is defined as `B f g x = f (g x)`. Its SKI representation is `S(S(K S) K)`. We can see this pattern in the expression.\n2.  The combinator `U` (also known as the mockingbird or self-application combinator) is `U x = x x`. Its SKI representation is `S(I)(I)`.\n\nLet's substitute these into the expression `E`.\nThe sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the `B` combinator.\nThe sub-expression `S(I)(I)` is the `U` combinator.\n\nSo, `E` can be rewritten as:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(B I))))(B U))`\n\nNow, let's simplify further:\n*   The term `B I` reduces to `I`, since `(B I) f x = I (f x) = f x`.\n*   Therefore, `K(B I)` becomes `K I`.\n\nThe expression now is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K I)))(B U))`\n\nTo reduce this, we need to understand the behavior of the `S(I)` combinator:\n`S(I) a b = I b (a b) = b (a b)`\n\nLet `X = S(I)`, `A = K I`, and `B' = B U`. The expression has the structure `X (X (X A)) B'`. Let's reduce this from the outside in:\n*   `X (X (X A)) B' = B' (X (X A) B')`\n*   `= B' (B' (X A B'))`\n*   `= B' (B' (B' (A B')))`\n\nNow we evaluate the innermost part, `A B'`:\n*   `A B' = (K I) (B U) = I`\n\nSo the entire expression `E` reduces to `B' (B' (B' I))`. Substituting `B'` back with `B U`, we get:\n`E = (B U) ((B U) ((B U) I))`\n\nLet's evaluate this expression from the inside out. Let `G = B U`. The expression is `G (G (G I))`.\n1.  `G I = (B U) I`. When applied to an argument `x`, `(B U I) x = U (I x) = U x = x x`. Thus, `(B U) I` is equivalent to the `U` combinator.\n2.  Next, we have `G (U) = (B U) U`. When applied to `x`, `(B U U) x = U (U x) = (U x) (U x) = (x x) (x x)`.\n3.  Finally, let `U_2 = (B U) U`. The full expression is `G (U_2) = (B U) U_2`. When applied to `x`:\n    `(B U U_2) x = U (U_2 x) = (U_2 x) (U_2 x) = ((x x)(x x)) ((x x)(x x))`.\n\nThe normal form of the combinator `E` is the lambda expression `Î»x. ((x x)(x x)) ((x x)(x x))`.\n\nIn the context of Church numerals, the integer `n` represents the number of times a function `f` is applied. In some non-standard representations, particularly in esoteric programming, `n` can be the number of times the variable appears in the normal form of the combinator. In the resulting lambda expression, the variable `x` appears 8 times.\n\nThus, we conclude that `n = 8`.\n\nThe final step is to calculate `log_2(n)`:\n`log_2(8) = 3`\n\n<<<3>>>"
