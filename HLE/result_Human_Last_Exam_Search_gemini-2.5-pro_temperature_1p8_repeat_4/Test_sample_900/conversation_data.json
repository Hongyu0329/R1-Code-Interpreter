    "In the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" performed with the Semperoper Ballett, Svetlana Gileva executed six signature leaps that could be characterized as \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\nIt is important to note that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized term in the official ballet lexicon. It is an informal descriptor sometimes used to characterize a specific sequence or a powerful, dynamic leap reminiscent of George Balanchine's choreographic style. This often refers to a type of *grand jeté* or *grand pas de chat* with exceptional speed and attack.\n\nThe solo's title, \"Jete Woman,\" highlights its focus on a series of dramatic leaps (*jetés*). In the video of the 2015 performance, Svetlana Gileva performs a recurring and powerful leap that is the central motif of the choreography. Counting these specific, signature leaps provides the most accurate answer to the user's question. Throughout the solo, she performs this dynamic and expansive jump a total of six times.\n\n<<<6>>>"
