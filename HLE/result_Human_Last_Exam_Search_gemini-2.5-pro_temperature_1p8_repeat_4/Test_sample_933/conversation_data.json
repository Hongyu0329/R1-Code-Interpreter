    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be achieved through various methods, with the most common being the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas at elevated temperatures.\n\nThe seminal synthesis of XeF4 involved heating a 1:5 molar ratio of xenon to fluorine in a nickel vessel to 400°C. This method is widely cited and considered effective. A patent for the process specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature. Some preparations have used temperatures as high as 600°C (873 K).\n\nHowever, other methods have been developed that operate at different temperatures. Flow methods, where xenon and fluorine are passed through a heated nickel tube, have been used at temperatures between 300-500°C. While reaction products for xenon fluorides can be observed at temperatures as low as 120°C, this does not guarantee an efficient process for XeF4.\n\nSignificantly, a Russian patent describes a method for producing XeF4 by initiating the combustion of xenon and fluorine with a current pulse that heats an initiator to 650-700°C. In this process, the reactor wall itself is maintained at a much lower temperature of 70-80°C. This method is reported to be highly efficient, yielding a product with a 97-98% concentration of XeF4.\n\nConversely, methods like using a glow discharge can produce a mixture of xenon fluorides at very low temperatures (0°C to -80°C), but this process is noted for its low productivity and difficulty in separating the desired XeF4 product.\n\nConsidering the requirement for an *efficient* production method, the process with the reactor walls heated to 70-80°C stands out as the coldest efficient synthesis described. Therefore, among the choices provided, 78°C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<D>>>"
