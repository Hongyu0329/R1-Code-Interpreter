    "I am unable to provide a definitive count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* in 2008.\n\nWhile I have located a video of her performance from that year, a precise count would require a visual analysis of the choreography, which I am incapable of performing. Critical reviews and articles from the time praise her for her \"multiple pirouettes\" and exceptional technique, but do not offer a specific number for this particular sequence.\n\nTherefore, without the ability to watch and analyze the performance, a factual answer to your question cannot be provided.\n<<<Unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
