    "In the context of the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is determined through the epsilon expansion. This expansion considers the deviation from four dimensions, ε = 4 - d, as a small parameter.\n\nThe analysis begins with the renormalization group (RG) beta function, which describes how the coupling constant changes with the energy scale. To the leading order in both the coupling and ε, the beta function for a properly normalized coupling u is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + Bu²\n\nwhere B is a constant that depends on the specifics of the theory, such as the number of field components. For the single-component scalar ϕ⁴ theory, the constant B is 3.\n\nThe fixed point of the theory, u*, represents a scale-invariant point where the coupling constant ceases to change with the energy scale. This is mathematically expressed by setting the beta function to zero:\n\nβ(u*) = 0\n\nThis leads to the equation:\n\n-εu* + 3(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: a trivial one at u* = 0, known as the Gaussian fixed point, and a non-trivial one which corresponds to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. By factoring out u*, we find the non-trivial solution:\n\nu* = ε / 3\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of ε.\n\n<<<u* = ε / 3>>>"
