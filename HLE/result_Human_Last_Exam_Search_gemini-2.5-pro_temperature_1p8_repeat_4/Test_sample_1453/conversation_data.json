    "Based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" interactions and packing efficiency in coiled-coil proteins, the oligomeric state of a sequence is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`).\n\n1.  **Identifying the Heptad Repeat:** First, we must determine the correct phasing of the heptad repeat for the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. Coiled-coils are characterized by a pattern of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) residues, typically HPPHPPP, where 'a' and 'd' are hydrophobic. Analyzing the sequence reveals a likely phasing of `efgabcdefg...` starting from `G-E-I`. This assignment places the most hydrophobic residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\n    *   **Sequence:**   G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **W** S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G\n    *   **Register:**   e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** ...\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Core 'a' and 'd' Positions:**\n    *   The residues at the **'a' positions** are: Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Tryptophan (W), and Alanine (A).\n    *   The residues at the **'d' positions** are all Leucine (L).\n\n3.  **Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles:** The size and shape of the amino acid side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions dictate the packing efficiency and thus the number of helices in the bundle.\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Often stabilized by a combination of a small residue at the 'a' position (like Alanine) and a larger one at the 'd' position (like Leucine), or vice versa. This asymmetric packing fits well in a two-helix interface. Landmark studies by Harbury et al. showed that a sequence with Isoleucine (beta-branched) at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' forms a dimer.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Typically requires symmetric packing, often achieved with Leucine at both the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Generally requires bulky residues to create a larger hydrophobic core. Combinations like Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd', or Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd', favor a four-helix bundle.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for the Given Sequence:** The sequence predominantly features Alanine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position. This combination of a small residue ('a') and a larger residue ('d') is a strong indicator of a dimeric structure. While one 'a' position contains a very bulky Tryptophan, this is an exception in the sequence, and a dimeric structure is most able to accommodate such an irregularity. The overall pattern strongly disfavors the symmetric packing required for trimers or tetramers. Therefore, the most probable oligomeric state is a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
