The equilibrium value of the mean energy for a photon gas is given by ⟨E⟩ = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴, and the equilibrium value of the entropy is S = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³. These results are derived from the Bose-Einstein distribution (with zero chemical potential), which is itself a consequence of maximizing the statistical entropy of the system under the constraint of fixed total energy, a procedure rigorously justified by large deviation theorems such as the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.
