    "The initial search results confirm that a \"Manhattan lattice\" is another term for the square lattice. The search also led to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A001411, which is titled \"Number of n-step self-avoiding walks on square lattice\". The problem asks for a(10), and the OEIS entry and other search results provide a list of the first few terms of this sequence. I can directly extract the value for n=10 from these lists. Therefore, I have sufficient information and do not need to perform additional searches.\n\na(10) is the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or square) lattice. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), sequence A001411, lists the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice.\n\nThe sequence begins:\na(1) = 4\na(2) = 12\na(3) = 36\na(4) = 100\na(5) = 284\na(6) = 780\na(7) = 2172\na(8) = 5916\na(9) = 16268\na(10) = 44100\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>> a(10) is the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or square) lattice. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists the sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice as A001411. For n=10, the value is 44,100.\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 44,100.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice is another name for the square grid. The number of such walks of a given length 'n' is a well-studied problem in combinatorics and physics.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. The initial terms of this sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
