    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G_0, describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of such systems.\n\nThe bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) in frequency-momentum space is given by the following expression:\n\n***\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\n***\n\nHere's a breakdown of the components in this expression:\n\n*   **ω**: Represents the frequency.\n*   **k**: Represents the momentum or wave vector of the particle.\n*   **ϵ_k**: This is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a particle with momentum k. It describes the energy of the particle in the absence of interactions.\n*   **iδ**: This is an infinitesimally small positive quantity. Its inclusion is a mathematical prescription, known as the \"iε prescription,\" which ensures the correct time-ordering of events in the path integral and that the particle propagates forward in time. In essence, it defines how to handle the pole at ω = ϵ_k in the complex frequency plane.\n\nThis form of the Green's function, also known as the propagator, has a pole at the energy of the single-particle state.\n\nThe relationship can also be seen through a spectral representation of the Green's function. For a general Green's function, the Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency (or energy) domain results in a spectral form:\n\n***\n\n**G(r, r'; E) = Σ_n [φ_n(r)φ_n*(r')] / [E - E_n]**\n\n***\n\nIn this expression:\n\n*   **E** is the energy.\n*   **E_n** are the energy eigenvalues of the system.\n*   **φ_n(r)** are the corresponding eigenfunctions.\n\nFor the bare Green's function G_0, which describes a non-interacting system, the energy eigenvalues E_n correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. This again demonstrates that the bare Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is that it is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) and the energy eigenvalue, with a small imaginary part to ensure causality.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), has an inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. In frequency-momentum space, this relationship is expressed as: **G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**, where ω is the frequency, k is the momentum, and iδ is an infinitesimal term to ensure correct causality. This means the Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues.>>>"
