In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), has an inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. In frequency-momentum space, this relationship is expressed as: **G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**, where ω is the frequency, k is the momentum, and iδ is an infinitesimal term to ensure correct causality. This means the Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues.
