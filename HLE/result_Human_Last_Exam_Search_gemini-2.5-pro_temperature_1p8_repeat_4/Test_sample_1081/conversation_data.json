    "A reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is necessarily split. This is because the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group, which implies there are no outer automorphisms for a split group of type $E_8$. Over a finite field, all inner forms of a simply connected or adjoint simple group are the split form. Since the number of maximal tori up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy is independent of the isogeny class, we can determine this number by considering the split group.\n\nFor a split reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius morphism acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy, are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a group of order $696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is known to be 112.\n\nThe classification of these conjugacy classes was described by R. Carter in 1972. The number of these classes can be derived from the structure and representation theory of the group.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n<<<112>>>"
