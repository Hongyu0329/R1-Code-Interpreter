    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), the total number of contracted Gaussian functions used is determined by summing the functions for each atom in the molecule.\n\nHere's the breakdown for each type of atom:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** In the 6-31G basis set, each carbon atom is described by 9 contracted Gaussian functions. This includes one function for the core (1s) orbital and two functions for each of the four valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom is described by 2 contracted Gaussian functions, as its single 1s valence orbital is split into two functions.\n\nToluene has 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n\n*   7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total = 63 + 16 = 79 functions**\n\n<<<79>>>"
