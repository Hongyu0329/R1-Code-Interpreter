    "Phosphorus can be observed in seven distinct colors across its various pure allotropes. These different forms of phosphorus have unique physical and chemical properties, with their color being one of the most prominent distinguishing features.\n\nThe observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\n*   **White:** Pure white phosphorus is a waxy, translucent solid.\n*   **Yellow:** Over time, or when exposed to light, white phosphorus can turn into a yellow variant.\n*   **Red:** This common allotrope has a red color, which can sometimes appear as a violet-red powder.\n*   **Scarlet:** This allotrope is an amorphous scarlet powder, distinguishing it from the more common red phosphorus.\n*   **Violet:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus or α-metallic phosphorus, this crystalline form has a distinct violet or red/purple color.\n*   **Black:** As the most thermodynamically stable allotrope, black phosphorus has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. It can also have an iron-grey luster.\n*   **Blue:** A more recently synthesized two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus is known as blue phosphorus.\n\nTherefore, a total of seven colors—white, yellow, red, scarlet, violet, black, and blue—can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n<<<7>>>"
