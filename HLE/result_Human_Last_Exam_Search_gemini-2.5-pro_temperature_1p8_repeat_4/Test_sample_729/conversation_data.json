    "I have found the following information. The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as Q128. It is a non-abelian group of order 128 = 2^7. The presentation of the generalized quaternion group of order 2^(k+1) is given by <a, x | x^2 = a^(2^(k-1)), a^(2^k) = 1, xax^(-1) = a^(-1)>. For Q128, k=6. So the presentation is <a, x | x^2 = a^32, a^64 = 1, xax^(-1) = a^(-1)>.\n\nA power subgroup H of a group G is a subgroup such that H = <g^m : g in G> for some non-negative integer m. I also found that every subgroup of a generalized quaternion group is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group.\n\nNow, I need to find the subgroups of Q128 and then check which of them are power subgroups. I have some information about the subgroups of generalized quaternion groups in general. Specifically, for Q_2n, the proper normal subgroups are the subgroups of <x> and two other subgroups of index 2 which are isomorphic to Q_2n-1. The subgroups of <x> are cyclic.\n\nI will proceed by listing the subgroups of Q128 and then determining which ones are power subgroups.\n\nI need to find a systematic way to list all subgroups of Q128 and a method to determine if a subgroup is a power subgroup.\n\nA key piece of information is that for a p-group, the number of subgroups of a given order is not straightforward to calculate without more specific information. However, for generalized quaternion groups, every subgroup is either cyclic or generalized quaternion.\n\nLet G = Q128. The order of G is 128 = 2^7.\nThe presentation is <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, yxy^-1 = x^-1>.\nThe subgroups of <x> are cyclic of orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. There is exactly one of each.\nOther subgroups are of the form <x^i, y> or <x^i y>. Let's analyze the structure.\nAccording to one of the search results, every subgroup of Q_2n is either cyclic or generalized quaternion. For Q128, n=7. The subgroups of Q128 are cyclic or isomorphic to Q_2k for k <= 6.\n\nLet's list the possible subgroups:\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups:** The subgroup <x> is a cyclic group of order 64. Its subgroups are cyclic of orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. There is exactly one of each.\n2.  **Generalized quaternion subgroups:** These subgroups must have an order of at least 8.\n    *   Subgroups isomorphic to Q8.\n    *   Subgroups isomorphic to Q16.\n    *   Subgroups isomorphic to Q32.\n    *   Subgroups isomorphic to Q64.\n\nI need more specific information about the number of each type of subgroup in Q128. After that I need to determine which of these are power subgroups.\n\nI will search for the lattice of subgroups of a generalized quaternion group and properties of power subgroups in these groups.\n\nThe next steps are:\n1. Find a detailed description of the subgroup lattice of the generalized quaternion group Q128. This will give me a complete list of all subgroups.\n2. For each subgroup, I need to determine if it is a power subgroup. A subgroup H is a power subgroup if H = G^m = {g^m | g in G} for some integer m. I will need to compute these power subgroups G^m for various m.\n\nI will now generate a search query to get the lattice of subgroups and information about power subgroups.From the search results, I've gathered crucial information about the generalized quaternion group of size 128, Q128. It has 70 subgroups in 18 conjugacy classes, with 10 of them being normal. The presentation of Q128 is <a, b | a^64 = 1, b^2 = a^32, bab^-1 = a^-1>.\n\nA key property of generalized quaternion groups (Q_2n) is that every subgroup is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group. For Q128, n=7. The subgroups are therefore cyclic or of the form Q_2k for k in {3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nThe structure of normal subgroups of Q_2n for n >= 4 consists of the subgroups of the cyclic subgroup <a> and two subgroups of index 2 isomorphic to Q_2n-1.\n\nI now need to determine the power subgroups. A subgroup H is a power subgroup of G if H = G^m = {g^m | g in G} for some non-negative integer m. To figure this out, I need to compute the sets G^m for Q128 for relevant values of m.\n\nThe elements of Q128 are of the form a^i and a^i*b for 0 <= i < 64.\nLet's analyze the powers of these elements.\n(a^i)^m = a^(im)\n(a^i*b)^2 = a^i*b*a^i*b = a^i * (b*a^i*b^-1) * b^2 = a^i * (a^-i) * a^32 = a^32.\n(a^i*b)^m ?\n(a^i*b)^3 = (a^i*b)^2 * (a^i*b) = a^32 * a^i*b = a^(32+i)*b.\n(a^i*b)^4 = ((a^i*b)^2)^2 = (a^32)^2 = a^64 = 1.\nSo, any element of the form a^i*b has order 4.\n\nLet's compute G^m for some values of m for Q_2n = <x, y | x^(2n-1)=1, y^2=x^(2n-2), yxy^-1=x^-1>. For Q128, n=7, so x corresponds to a and y to b. The order of a is 64, and elements outside <a> have order 4.\n\nG^0 = {1}, the trivial subgroup. This is always a power subgroup.\nG^1 = G = Q128. This is also always a power subgroup.\nG^2 = {g^2 | g in G}.\nIf g is in <a>, g=a^i, then g^2 = a^(2i). These form the subgroup <a^2>, a cyclic group of order 32.\nIf g is not in <a>, g=a^i*b, then g^2 = a^32.\nSo G^2 = <a^2> U {a^32} = <a^2> because a^32 is in <a^2>. Thus, G^2 is the cyclic subgroup of order 32, <a^2>. This is a power subgroup.\n\nG^3:\n(a^i)^3 = a^(3i). These form the subgroup <a^3> = <a> since gcd(3, 64)=1.\n(a^i*b)^3 = a^(32+i)*b. This gives 64 elements of the form a^k*b.\nSo G^3 = <a> U {a^k*b} = G. Q128 is a power subgroup.\n\nG^4:\n(a^i)^4 = a^(4i). These form the subgroup <a^4>, a cyclic group of order 16.\n(a^i*b)^4 = 1.\nSo G^4 = <a^4> U {1} = <a^4>. This is the cyclic subgroup of order 16. This is a power subgroup.\n\nG^m where m is odd:\nIf m is odd, gcd(m, 64) = 1 or not. Let's assume m is any integer.\n(a^i)^m = a^(im)\n(a^i*b)^m depends on m mod 4.\nIf m is odd, say m=2k+1, (a^i*b)^m = (a^i*b)^(2k) * (a^i*b) = (a^32)^k * (a^i*b) = a^(32k) * a^i*b = a^(32k+i)*b.\nSo if m is odd, G^m will contain elements of the form a^j*b and will be the entire group Q128 if gcd(m, 64)=1, or will it? Let's be more careful.\nLet m be an odd integer.\nG^m = {g^m | g in G}\n= {(a^i)^m} U {(a^i*b)^m}\n= {a^(im)} U {a^(i+32k)b if m=2k+1}\nLet's check G^m for odd m more carefully.\nIf m is odd, then i -> im is a bijection on Z_64 if gcd(m, 64) = 1. So {a^(im)} will be <a>.\nAlso, i -> i + 32k is a bijection on Z_64. So {a^(i+32k)b} is the set of all elements outside <a>.\nSo if m is odd and gcd(m, 64)=1, G^m = G.\nWhat if gcd(m, 64) != 1? For instance, m=3 has gcd(3,64)=1, so G^3=G.\nm=5, gcd(5,64)=1, G^5=G. All odd m not divisible by any power of 2 will result in G^m=G since they will have an inverse mod 64. No, gcd(m, 64)=1 is what is needed.\nSo for any odd m, gcd(m, 64) will be 1, so i -> im will be a permutation of Z_64. This is not true. gcd(3, 64)=1, gcd(5,64)=1, but gcd(2,64) !=1.\nLet's consider m = 2^k * l where l is odd.\nG^(2k):\n(a^i)^(2k) = a^(i*2^k) -> <a^(2^k)>\n(a^i*b)^(2k) = (a^32)^k\nIf k is even, (a^32)^k = a^(32k) = (a^64)^(k/2) = 1.\nIf k is odd, (a^32)^k = a^(32k) = a^32 * a^(32(k-1)) = a^32.\nThe order of a^i*b is 4. So m only matters mod 4.\nLet's re-evaluate G^m.\n\nThe set of element orders in Q128 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (for elements in <a>) and 4 (for elements not in <a>).\n\nG^m:\n- If g is in <a>, |g| = 64/gcd(i, 64) where g=a^i. g^m = a^(im).\n- If g is not in <a>, |g|=4. g^m is 1 if 4|m, g^2=a^32 if m is 2 mod 4, g if m is 1 mod 4, and g^3 if m is 3 mod 4.\nLet's check the G^m sets.\n- G^0 = {1} (cyclic of order 1)\n- G^1 = Q128\n- G^2 = <a^2> (cyclic of order 32)\n- G^3 = G^1 = Q128\n- G^4 = <a^4> U {1} = <a^4> (cyclic of order 16)\n- G^5 = G\n- G^6 = G^2\n- G^8 = <a^8> U {1} = <a^8> (cyclic of order 8)\n- G^16 = <a^16> (cyclic of order 4)\n- G^32 = <a^32> (cyclic of order 2)\n- G^64 = {1}\n\nLet's look at m that are not powers of 2. Say m=6 = 2*3.\nG^6 = {g^6 | g in G}.\n(a^i)^6 = a^(6i). {a^(6i)} is <a^gcd(6,64)> = <a^2>.\n(a^i*b)^6 = ((a^i*b)^2)^3 = (a^32)^3 = a^96 = a^32.\nSo G^6 = <a^2> U {a^32} = <a^2>. Same as G^2.\nIn general, if m=2k, G^m = {g^(2k)} = {(g^2)^k}.\ng^2 is either a^(2i) or a^32.\nSo G^(2k) = {a^(2ik)} U {a^(32k)}.\nThis will be a subgroup of <a>. Specifically, it will be <a^(2k)> U {a^(32k)}.\nIf k is even, a^(32k) = 1. G^(2k)=<a^(2k)>.\nIf k is odd, a^(32k) = a^32. G^(2k)=<a^(2k)> U {a^32}. Since 2k is a multiple of 2 but not a multiple of 64 (unless k is a multiple of 32), a^32 will be in <a^(2k)>. Let's see. 32 = 2k * l for some integer l? 16 = k*l. This is true if k is a divisor of 16.\nSo if k is a divisor of 16 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16), then a^32 is in <a^(2k)>.\nm=2k.\nG^m = G^(2k) = <a^gcd(2k, 64)>. Let's verify.\n(a^i)^m = a^(im). This gives <a^gcd(m, 64)>.\n(a^i*b)^m = (a^32)^(m/2).\nIf m/2 is even, this is 1. If m/2 is odd, this is a^32.\nIf m is a multiple of 4, m/2 is even, so (a^i*b)^m=1. Then G^m = <a^gcd(m,64)>.\nm=4, G^4=<a^4>. Correct.\nm=8, G^8=<a^8>. Correct.\nm=12, G^12 = <a^12> U {1} = <a^gcd(12, 64)> = <a^4>. So <a^4> is also a power subgroup, obtained from m=4 and m=12, etc.\nm=16, G^16=<a^16>.\nm=20, G^20=<a^20> U {1} = <a^gcd(20,64)> = <a^4>.\nm=24, G^24=<a^24> U {a^32} because 24/2=12 is even? No, 24/2=12. (a^i*b)^24 = (a^32)^12 = 1. So G^24=<a^gcd(24,64)>=<a^8>. So <a^8> is a power subgroup.\nm=28, G^28 = <a^28> = <a^4>.\nm=32, G^32=<a^32>.\nm=64, G^64=<a^64> = {1}.\n\nIf m is not a multiple of 4, but is even (m = 2 mod 4). m = 2, 6, 10, 14, ...\nm=2, G^2 = <a^2> U {a^32} = <a^2>. Correct.\nm=6, G^6 = <a^6> U {a^32} = <a^gcd(6,64)> U {a^32} = <a^2> U {a^32} = <a^2>.\nm=10, G^10 = <a^10> U {a^32} = <a^gcd(10,64)> U {a^32} = <a^2> U {a^32} = <a^2>.\nm=18, G^18 = <a^18> U {a^32} = <a^2> U {a^32} = <a^2>.\nIn general, if m = 2 * (odd), G^m = <a^gcd(m, 64)> U {a^32}. gcd(m, 64)=2. So G^m=<a^2> U {a^32} = <a^2>.\n\nWhat about m is odd?\nG^m = {a^(im)} U {(a^ib)^m}.\nIf m is odd, (a^ib)^m = a^j b for some j. So you get all the elements outside <a>.\nAlso {a^(im)} will be <a> if gcd(m, 64) = 1. All odd numbers m have gcd(m,64)=1. Not true. Oh, 64=2^6. So any odd number is coprime to 64. Yes, this is true.\nSo, for any odd m, {a^(im)} generates <a>, and {(a^ib)^m} generates all elements outside <a>.\nSo G^m = Q128 for all odd m.\n\nSo the power subgroups are:\n1.  {1} (from m=64, or any multiple of 64)\n2.  <a^32> (cyclic, order 2) (from m=32)\n3.  <a^16> (cyclic, order 4) (from m=16)\n4.  <a^8> (cyclic, order 8) (from m=8)\n5.  <a^4> (cyclic, order 16) (from m=4)\n6.  <a^2> (cyclic, order 32) (from m=2)\n7.  <a> (cyclic, order 64). I don't think <a> is a power subgroup. Let's see. For H = <a> to be a power subgroup, there must be an m such that G^m = <a>.\nLet's check G^m. If m is even, G^m is a proper subgroup of <a> or {1}.\nIf m is odd, G^m = G = Q128.\nSo <a>, the cyclic subgroup of order 64, is NOT a power subgroup.\n8.  Q128 (the whole group) (from m=1, 3, 5, ...)\n\nLet me re-check my G^m calculations.\nLet G = Q_2n = <x,y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, y^2 = x^(2^(n-2)), yxy^-1 = x^-1>\nFor Q128, n=7. x=a, y=b.\nElements are a^k and a^k y for k in {0, ..., 63}.\nLet m be an integer.\nG^m = {g^m | g in G} = {(a^k)^m} U {(a^k y)^m}.\n(a^k)^m = a^(km). This gives the subgroup <a^gcd(m, 64)>.\n(a^k y)^2 = a^(32). So (a^k y)^(2j) = a^(32j).\nAnd (a^k y)^(2j+1) = a^(32j) (a^k y).\nIf m is odd, say m=2j+1, (a^k y)^m = a^(32j) a^k y = a^(k+32j) y. As k ranges over {0, ..., 63}, so does k+32j if j is fixed. So {(a^k y)^m} is the set of all elements outside <a>.\nSo for m odd, G^m = <a^gcd(m, 64)> U {elements outside <a>}. Since m is odd, gcd(m, 64)=1. So <a^gcd(m, 64)> = <a>.\nThus, for m odd, G^m = <a> U {elements outside <a>} = G. So Q128 is a power subgroup.\n\nIf m is even, say m=2j.\nG^m = <a^gcd(m, 64)> U {(a^k y)^m} = <a^gcd(2j, 64)> U {a^(32j)}.\na^(32j) = a^(16m). We need to check if a^(16m) is in <a^gcd(2j, 64)>.\nThe generator of this subgroup is a^d where d=gcd(2j, 64). We need to check if 16m is a multiple of d.\nd divides 2j=m, so m=dq for some q. We need to check if 16(dq) is a multiple of d. This is always true.\nSo {a^(32j)} is always a subset of <a^gcd(m, 64)>.\nSo for m even, G^m = <a^gcd(m, 64)>.\n\nLet's list the power subgroups based on this corrected calculation for even m.\nm=2, d=gcd(2,64)=2. G^2 = <a^2> (cyclic of order 32).\nm=4, d=gcd(4,64)=4. G^4 = <a^4> (cyclic of order 16).\nm=6, d=gcd(6,64)=2. G^6 = <a^2>.\nm=8, d=gcd(8,64)=8. G^8 = <a^8> (cyclic of order 8).\nm=10, d=gcd(10,64)=2. G^10 = <a^2>.\nm=12, d=gcd(12,64)=4. G^12 = <a^4>.\nm=14, d=gcd(14,64)=2. G^14 = <a^2>.\nm=16, d=gcd(16,64)=16. G^16 = <a^16> (cyclic of order 4).\nm=32, d=gcd(32,64)=32. G^32 = <a^32> (cyclic of order 2).\nm=64, d=gcd(64,64)=64. G^64 = <a^64> = {1} (trivial subgroup).\n\nThe set of power subgroups are:\n{Q128, <a^2>, <a^4>, <a^8>, <a^16>, <a^32>, {1}}.\nThese are 7 distinct subgroups.\n\nAre there any other power subgroups?\nLet m be any integer.\nIf m is odd, G^m = Q128.\nIf m is even, G^m = <a^d> where d=gcd(m, 2^(n-1)). For Q128, n=7, so d=gcd(m, 64).\nThe possible values for d are the divisors of 64, which are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nBut m must be even, so d=gcd(m, 64) must be a multiple of gcd(2, 64)=2, so d cannot be 1.\nSo the possible values for d are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nd=2: G^2 = <a^2>\nd=4: G^4 = <a^4>\nd=8: G^8 = <a^8>\nd=16: G^16 = <a^16>\nd=32: G^32 = <a^32>\nd=64: G^64 = <a^64> = {1}.\n\nSo the list of power subgroups is:\n1. Q128 (for any odd m)\n2. <a^2> (cyclic of order 32, from m=2)\n3. <a^4> (cyclic of order 16, from m=4)\n4. <a^8> (cyclic of order 8, from m=8)\n5. <a^16> (cyclic of order 4, from m=16)\n6. <a^32> (cyclic of order 2, from m=32)\n7. {1} (trivial, from m=64)\n\nThese are 7 subgroups.\n\nI need to be very confident about this. Let me double check the reasoning for G^m = <a^gcd(m,64)> for even m.\nLet m=2k.\nG^m = {(a^i)^m} U {(a^i*b)^m}.\n{(a^i)^m} for i=0..63 is the subgroup <a^gcd(m,64)>.\n(a^i*b)^m = (a^i*b)^(2k) = ((a^i*b)^2)^k = (a^32)^k = a^(32k).\nNote that m=2k, so 32k = 16m.\nSo G^m = <a^gcd(m,64)> U {a^(16m)}.\nWe need to check if a^(16m) is in <a^gcd(m,64)>.\nLet d=gcd(m,64). We need to check if 16m is a multiple of d.\nSince d divides m, m = dq for some integer q. So we need to check if 16dq is a multiple of d, which is always true.\nSo for any even m, G^m = <a^gcd(m,64)>.\n\nThe possible values of d = gcd(m, 64) where m is even are the even divisors of 64.\nDivisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nEven divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nThis gives the following power subgroups:\n1. <a^2> (cyclic of order 32)\n2. <a^4> (cyclic of order 16)\n3. <a^8> (cyclic of order 8)\n4. <a^16> (cyclic of order 4)\n5. <a^32> (cyclic of order 2)\n6. <a^64> = {1} (trivial)\n\nNow, what about m being odd?\nG^m = {(a^i)^m} U {(a^i*b)^m}.\nSince m is odd, gcd(m,64)=1. So {(a^i)^m} generates all of <a>.\n(a^i*b)^m = a^j*b for some j, so you get all elements outside of <a>.\nSo for any odd m, G^m = G = Q128.\n\nSo the list of distinct power subgroups is:\n{1}, <a^32>, <a^16>, <a^8>, <a^4>, <a^2>, Q128.\n\nThis is a total of 7 power subgroups.\nThe subgroups are:\n1. The trivial subgroup {1}.\n2. The cyclic subgroup of order 2, <a^32>.\n3. The cyclic subgroup of order 4, <a^16>.\n4. The cyclic subgroup of order 8, <a^8>.\n5. The cyclic subgroup of order 16, <a^4>.\n6. The cyclic subgroup of order 32, <a^2>.\n7. The entire group Q128.\n\nThe list seems correct and the derivation is consistent. The key was to correctly calculate G^m. I am now confident in this result.\nFinal count is 7.There are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q128).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the power subgroups:\nThe generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, has the presentation  <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, yxy^-1 = x^-1>. The elements of Q128 are of the form x^i and x^i*y for 0 ≤ i < 64.\n\nA power subgroup is a subgroup H of a group G such that H = {g^m | g ∈ G} for some non-negative integer m, denoted as G^m.\n\nThe power subgroups of Q128 are:\n*   **The trivial subgroup {1}:** This is obtained when m is a multiple of 64 (e.g., m=64). For any element g in Q128, its order divides 64, so g^64 = 1.\n*   **The cyclic subgroup of order 2, <x^32>:** This is obtained for m=32.\n*   **The cyclic subgroup of order 4, <x^16>:** This is obtained for m=16.\n*   **The cyclic subgroup of order 8, <x^8>:** This is obtained for m=8.\n*   **The cyclic subgroup of order 16, <x^4>:** This is obtained for m=4.\n*   **The cyclic subgroup of order 32, <x^2>:** This is obtained for m=2.\n*   **The entire group Q128:** This is obtained for any odd integer m. For any odd m, the set {g^m | g ∈ Q128} includes all elements of Q128.\n\nThese are the 7 distinct power subgroups of Q128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
