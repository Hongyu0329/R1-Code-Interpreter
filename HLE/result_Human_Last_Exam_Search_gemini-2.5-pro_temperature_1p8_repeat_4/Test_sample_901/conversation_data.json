    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThis outcome is determined by the specific requirements of the E2 elimination reaction mechanism, which is favored by the strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide. The key aspects of this reaction are:\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The use of potassium tert-butoxide, a strong and bulky base, promotes a bimolecular elimination (E2) reaction.\n*   **Stereochemical Requirement:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the hydrogen to be eliminated and the leaving group (the bromine atom) must be in an anti-periplanar, or trans-diaxial, position. This means both groups must be in axial positions on adjacent carbons, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *trans* isomer. It exists in two primary chair conformations:\n    1.  A more stable conformation where the bulky bromine and methyl groups are in equatorial positions. E2 elimination cannot occur from this conformation because the bromine is not axial.\n    2.  A less stable conformation where both the bromine and methyl groups are in axial positions. Although this conformation is less favored, the molecule must adopt it for the reaction to proceed.\n*   **Product Determination:** In the reactive (diaxial) conformation, the bromine is axial. To find the proton that can be eliminated, we look at the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6):\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is axial, meaning the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination cannot occur to form a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has an axial hydrogen which is perfectly oriented in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) position relative to the axial bromine on C1.\n\nTherefore, the base can only remove the axial hydrogen from C6. This leads exclusively to the formation of a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 6, resulting in the product **3-methylcyclohexene**. While potassium tert-butoxide typically favors the less substituted (Hofmann) product due to its bulk, in this case, the rigid stereochemical demands of the E2 reaction on the cyclohexane ring are the decisive factor that dictates the formation of only one product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
