    "The Beatles song that starts its verse with a distinctive chord jump from the tonic to a complex chord that can be perceived as a \"minor fifth\" is **\"Michelle\"**.\n\nThe song is in the key of F, and the verse begins with a clear F major chord (the tonic) on the word \"Michelle\". On the very next phrase, \"ma belle\", the harmony shifts unexpectedly to a B♭7♯9 chord.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this matches your description:\n\n*   **Tonic Start:** The verse begins on the tonic F major chord.\n*   **The \"Jump\":** The immediate move to the B♭7♯9 is a surprising and harmonically rich change. Paul McCartney himself described this as a \"great ham-fisted jazz chord\". This sudden shift can be described as a \"jump\".\n*   **The \"Minor Fifth\" Perception:** The B♭7♯9 chord is complex, but it contains a D♭, which is the minor third of B♭. This gives the chord a distinct minor quality. While B♭ is the fourth degree of F (the subdominant), a listener might misremember it as the \"fifth\" and focus on the chord's minor feel, leading to the description \"minor fifth chord\". The clash between the major third (D) and the minor third/sharp ninth (D♭) in the melody and harmony creates a unique tension.\n\nThe introduction to \"Michelle\" is also notable, as it starts in F minor and features a descending chromatic bassline before the verse begins on F major. This interplay between the major and minor tonalities is a key feature of the song.\n\nWhile other Beatles songs feature interesting uses of minor chords, such as the minor subdominant (iv) in \"I'll Follow the Sun\", the striking and immediate leap from a simple tonic to a complex, minor-sounding chord in the opening of the verse makes \"Michelle\" the most likely answer to your question.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
