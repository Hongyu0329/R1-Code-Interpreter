    "During World War II, the Belgian refugee who was falsely believed to be a German spy by counterintelligence in the UK, due to the concealment of his true profession, was in fact the head of the Belgian counter-espionage service.\n\nThis case was investigated by the renowned Dutch counter-intelligence officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Oreste Pinto, who was working with MI5. The refugee initially claimed to be a humble hotel waiter. Pinto's suspicions were aroused, leading to a thorough interrogation. Ultimately, the man's true identity as a high-ranking intelligence official was revealed. He had concealed his profession for security reasons, fearing that if his true role was known and he was captured by the Germans, the consequences would be severe for both himself and his network.\n\nThis incident is one of the many fascinating cases documented in Oreste Pinto's memoirs, including his book *Spycatcher*. The name \"Andre Vernault,\" as mentioned in the query, does not appear to be publicly associated with this specific case and may be an inaccuracy in the recounting of the event.\n\n<<<head of the Belgian counter-espionage service>>>"
