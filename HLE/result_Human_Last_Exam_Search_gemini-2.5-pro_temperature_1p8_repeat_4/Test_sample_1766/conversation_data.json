    "<<<### For a p-electron Undergoing Spin-Orbit Coupling, Two Sets of Total Angular Momentum Eigenvalues Are Possible\n\nIn the quantum mechanical model of an atom, a p-electron subject to spin-orbit coupling can exist in states defined by coupled total angular momentum. The common eigenvalues for the operators $J^2$ (the square of the total angular momentum) and $J_z$ (the z-component of the total angular momentum) are determined by the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, `j`.\n\nA p-electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l = 1`. As an electron, its intrinsic spin angular momentum quantum number is `s = 1/2`. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum, **L**, and the spin angular momentum, **S**.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number `j` are determined by the coupling of `l` and `s`, ranging from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n*   `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n*   `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n\nTherefore, the two possible values for `j` are 1/2 and 3/2. These two values of `j` define two distinct energy levels, often referred to as a \"doublet\" state, due to the spin-orbit interaction.\n\nThe common eigenvalues are found for the states defined by these `j` values:\n\n#### Case 1: Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number j = 3/2\n*   **Eigenvalue of $J^2$:** The eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by $ħ^2j(j+1)$.\n    *   For `j = 3/2`, the eigenvalue is $ħ^2 * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**$.\n*   **Eigenvalues of $J_z$:** The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by $ħm_j$, where `m_j` ranges in integer steps from `-j` to `+j`.\n    *   For `j = 3/2`, the possible values for `m_j` are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n    *   The corresponding $J_z$ eigenvalues are **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ**.\n\n#### Case 2: Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number j = 1/2\n*   **Eigenvalue of $J^2$:**\n    *   For `j = 1/2`, the eigenvalue is $ħ^2 * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**$.\n*   **Eigenvalues of $J_z$:**\n    *   For `j = 1/2`, the possible values for `m_j` are -1/2 and 1/2.\n    *   The corresponding $J_z$ eigenvalues are **(-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ**.\n\nIn summary, a particle in a state with a specific `j` value will have a single, well-defined value for the total angular momentum squared ($J^2$) and one of several possible values for the z-component of the total angular momentum ($J_z$).>>>"
