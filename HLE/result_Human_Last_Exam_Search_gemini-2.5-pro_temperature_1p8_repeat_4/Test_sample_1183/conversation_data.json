    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **D3h**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the analysis of the molecule's structure as encoded in the SMILES string. The string describes a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three ethynyl (-C≡CH) substituents. The connectivity of the fused aromatic rings and the placement of the substituents indicate a high degree of symmetry.\n\nSpecifically, the structure possesses the following key symmetry elements characteristic of the D3h point group:\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n*   Three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂) in the plane of the molecule.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ).\n*   A three-fold improper rotation axis (S₃).\n\nThe D3h symmetry group is common for planar molecules with a threefold rotational symmetry, such as certain symmetrically substituted benzene derivatives and other aromatic compounds. The order of the D3h point group is 12, meaning there are 12 distinct symmetry operations that leave the molecule unchanged.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
