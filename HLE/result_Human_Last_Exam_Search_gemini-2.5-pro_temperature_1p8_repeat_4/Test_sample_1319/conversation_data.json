    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Ida, located on the island of Crete. It stands at an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet).\n\nThe *Iliad* makes mention of several other significant mountains, each with its own place in Greek mythology and the epic's narrative. While Mount Olympus is the highest peak in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet) and famed as the home of the gods, a number of other mountains feature in the story.\n\nHere are some of the other notable mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and their respective heights:\n\n*   **Mount Kyllini (Cyllene):** Located on the Peloponnese peninsula, this mountain reaches a height of 2,376 meters (7,795 feet).\n*   **Mount Ossa:** Situated in Thessaly, between Pelion and Olympus, it has an elevation of 1,978 meters (6,490 feet).\n*   **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Also known as Kaz Dağı, this mountain near the ancient city of Troy has a height of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). From its summit, the gods were said to have watched the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in southeastern Thessaly, its highest peak is 1,651 meters (5,417 feet).\n*   **Mount Neriton:** While its exact location is debated among scholars, it is often identified with Mount Ainos on the island of Kefalonia, which has an elevation of 1,628 meters.\n*   **Mount Titanus:** Mentioned by Homer as being near the ancient city of Asterium in Thessaly, its precise height is not documented.\n*   **Mount Placus:** Described as a foothill of the Turkish Mount Ida, it is therefore lower than 1,774 meters.\n\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
