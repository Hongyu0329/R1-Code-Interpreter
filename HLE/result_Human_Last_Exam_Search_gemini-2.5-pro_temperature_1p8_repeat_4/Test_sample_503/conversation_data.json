    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category Δ, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between two totally ordered sets.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Structure\n\n*   **Objects:** The objects in the category Δ are the finite ordinals `[n] = {0, 1, ..., n}`. In this problem, the objects are `[23]` and `[37]`.\n*   **1-Morphisms:** The 1-morphisms are the standard order-preserving maps between these sets. For an internal adjunction between `[23]` and `[37]`, we have a pair of order-preserving maps, `L: [23] → [37]` and `R: [37] → [23]`.\n*   **2-Morphisms:** The category is \"locally posetal,\" meaning for any two parallel 1-morphisms `f, g: [m] → [n]`, there is a 2-morphism `f ⇒ g` if and only if `f(i) ≤ g(i)` for all `i` in `[m]`.\n*   **Internal Adjunction:** An internal adjunction between `[23]` and `[37]` consists of the pair of maps (L, R) that satisfy two conditions:\n    1.  The *unit* condition: `id_[23] ≤ R ∘ L`. This means for all `i` in `[23]`, `i ≤ R(L(i))`.\n    2.  The *counit* condition: `L ∘ R ≤ id_[37]`. This means for all `j` in `[37]`, `L(R(j)) ≤ j`.\n\nThis set of conditions precisely defines a **Galois connection** between the posets `[23]` and `[37]`.\n\n### 2. Counting the Adjunctions\n\nThe number of Galois connections between two posets is equal to the number of supremum-preserving maps from the first to the second, or equivalently, the number of infimum-preserving maps from the second to the first. Let's analyze these two equivalent counting methods.\n\n#### Method 1: Counting Supremum-Preserving Maps\n\nA map `L: [n] → [m]` is supremum-preserving if and only if it is order-preserving and maps the least element to the least element.\n*   The least element of `[n]` is 0. Its supremum is itself.\n*   For `L: [23] → [37]` to be supremum-preserving, it must be order-preserving and satisfy `L(0) = 0`.\n\nWe need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences `L(0), L(1), ..., L(23)` such that `0 ≤ L(i) ≤ 37` for all `i`, with the added condition that `L(0) = 0`. This simplifies to finding the number of non-decreasing sequences `L(1), ..., L(23)` where each element is chosen from `{0, 1, ..., 37}`.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 numbers (for `L(1)` through `L(23)`) from a set of 38 possible values (`{0, ..., 37}`) with replacement, where the order is determined by the non-decreasing constraint. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n\nNumber = ( (k + r - 1) choose r )\n\nwhere `r = 23` (the number of items to choose) and `k = 38` (the number of options to choose from).\n\nNumber = ( (38 + 23 - 1) choose 23 ) = ( (60) choose 23 )\n\n#### Method 2: Counting Infimum-Preserving Maps\n\nAs a verification, we can count the number of infimum-preserving maps `R: [37] → [23]`. Such a map must be order-preserving and map the greatest element to the greatest element.\n*   The greatest element of `[37]` is 37, and for `[23]` it is 23.\n*   Therefore, an infimum-preserving map `R` must satisfy `R(37) = 23`.\n\nWe need to count non-decreasing sequences `R(0), ..., R(37)` where `0 ≤ R(j) ≤ 23` and `R(37) = 23`. This requires us to determine the values `R(0), ..., R(36)`, which must form a non-decreasing sequence with values chosen from `{0, ..., 23}`.\n\nHere, we are choosing 37 numbers (for `R(0)` to `R(36)`) from a set of 24 possible values (`{0, ..., 23}`).\n\nNumber = ( (k + r - 1) choose r )\n\nwhere `r = 37` and `k = 24`.\n\nNumber = ( (24 + 37 - 1) choose 37 ) = ( (60) choose 37 )\n\nUsing the identity `(n choose k) = (n choose n-k)`, we see that `(60 choose 37) = (60 choose 60-37) = (60 choose 23)`. Both methods yield the same result.\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is `(60 choose 23)`, which evaluates to:\n(60! / (23! * (60-23)!)) = (60! / (23! * 37!)) = 34,333,333,342,360,200.\n\n<<<34333333342360200>>>"
