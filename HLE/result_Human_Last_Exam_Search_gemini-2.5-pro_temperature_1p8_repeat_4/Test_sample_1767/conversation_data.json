    "### The Chern Number of a Laterally Connected Chern Insulator Junction is 2\n\nWhen two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they form a single composite system. The Chern number of this resulting junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, resulting in a total Chern number of 2.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological material characterized by a non-zero integer known as the Chern number. This number is a topological invariant, meaning it remains constant under continuous deformations of the system, and it dictates the number of robust, one-dimensional conducting edge states at the boundary of the material.\n\nWhen two such systems are brought into close contact, as in the case of a lateral junction with a negligible tunneling barrier, their electronic wavefunctions can overlap, and they behave as a unified topological system. Theoretical studies and experimental observations have shown that in such composite structures, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its constituent parts. For example, a stack of 'n' layers of a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1 will exhibit a total Chern number of 'n'.\n\nThis additivity principle is a fundamental consequence of the underlying mathematical framework of topology in condensed matter physics. The Chern number is mathematically defined as the integral of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. For a composite system where the individual components are weakly coupled, the total Berry curvature can be considered the sum of the Berry curvatures of the individual systems, leading to an additive Chern number. The negligible tunneling barrier ensures that the electrons can move between the two insulators, allowing the formation of a single topological state characterized by the combined Chern number.\n\nTherefore, for the described junction of two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 each, the resulting Chern number is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
