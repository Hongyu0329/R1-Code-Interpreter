    "In a fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level, also known as the firing strength, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the membership degrees of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of a fuzzy rule. For an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the process to arrive at a single membership value can be complex, often involving operations on vertical slices of the fuzzy set. However, once specific membership grades are determined, the t-norm operation itself is a standard fuzzy logic calculation.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   **Φ_k(x′) = 0.7**: This likely represents the aggregated membership degree of the inputs for the antecedent of the k-th rule.\n*   **μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9**: This appears to be another membership value, possibly of another antecedent or related to the consequent part of the rule.\n\nWhen calculating the overall firing strength of a rule with multiple antecedents, a t-norm is applied to the membership values of all antecedent parts. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. The most common t-norms are:\n\n1.  **Minimum t-norm:** This is the most frequently used t-norm and is calculated as the minimum of the given values.\n2.  **Product t-norm:** This is calculated by multiplying the given values.\n3.  **Lukasiewicz t-norm:** This is calculated as `max(0, a + b - 1)`.\n\nAssuming that `Φ_k(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)` are two membership values of the antecedents for a given rule, the rule activation level would be the result of the t-norm operation on these two values. Here are the results for the most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm:** `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n*   **Using the Product t-norm:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n*   **Using the Lukasiewicz t-norm:** `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nThe problem does not specify which t-norm to use. However, if a single answer must be provided, the minimum t-norm is the most standard and widely assumed choice in fuzzy systems.\n\nTherefore, using the most common t-norm (minimum), the rule activation level is **0.7**.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
