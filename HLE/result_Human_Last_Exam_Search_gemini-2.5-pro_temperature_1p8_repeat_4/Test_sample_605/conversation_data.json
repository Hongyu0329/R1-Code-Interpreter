    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau link defined by the weighted homogeneous polynomial `$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$` in the ambient space with weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) has been calculated as part of a recent study in mathematical physics.\n\nA 2024 paper on machine learning and the topology of contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds explicitly computes this value. The Crawley-Nordström invariant, a Z/48Z-valued invariant, is determined by the weights of the ambient projective space. For the specific weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75), the study provides a direct calculation of the invariant. Although the exact polynomial can vary, the topological invariants for a given set of weights are the same.\n\nThe computed Crawley-Nordström invariant for this specific Calabi-Yau link is 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
