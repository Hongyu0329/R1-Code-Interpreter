    "For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model with *n* replicas is the superspace SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassman variables, which are the bosonic variables, parametrize the bosonic sector of this manifold. The number of these variables is the dimension of this bosonic sector. For the case of two replicas (*n*=2), the relevant superspace is SpO(4, R|4)/U(2|2).\n\nTo find the dimension of the bosonic sector, we calculate the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic parts of the numerator and the denominator supergroups.\n\n### Bosonic Subgroup of the Numerator: SpO(4, R|4)\nThe bosonic subgroup of the supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is Sp(2n, R) × SO(2n). With *n*=2, the bosonic subgroup of SpO(4, R|4) is Sp(4, R) × SO(4).\n\n*   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2k, R) is given by the formula k(2k+1). For Sp(4, R), where k=2, the dimension is 2(2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the special orthogonal group SO(k) is given by k(k-1)/2. For SO(4), the dimension is 4(4-1)/2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total dimension of the bosonic part of SpO(4, R|4) is 10 + 6 = 16.\n\n### Bosonic Subgroup of the Denominator: U(2|2)\nThe bosonic subgroup of the unitary supergroup U(n|n) is U(n) × U(n). For *n*=2, this is U(2) × U(2).\n\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(k) is k². For U(2), the dimension is 2² = 4.\n*   Thus, the total dimension of the bosonic subgroup of U(2|2) is dim(U(2)) + dim(U(2)) = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n### Number of Non-Grassman Variables\nThe number of non-Grassman variables that parametrize the bosonic sector of the sigma-model is the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic parts of the numerator and the denominator:\n\nDimension = (Dimension of bosonic part of SpO(4, R|4)) - (Dimension of bosonic part of U(2|2))\nDimension = 16 - 8 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
