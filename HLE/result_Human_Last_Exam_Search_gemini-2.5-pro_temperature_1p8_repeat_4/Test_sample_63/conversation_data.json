    "In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Kurt Vonnegut noted that the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer looked like a porcupine in all his pictures. Born in 1788, Schopenhauer was a philosopher known for his pessimistic views and his metaphysical doctrine of the will.\n\nWhile there is no commonly known two-word nickname for Schopenhauer that starts with the same letter, a fitting description based on Vonnegut's observation would be:\n\n<<<Spiky Schopenhauer>>>"
