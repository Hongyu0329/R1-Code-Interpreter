    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF involves a series of substitution reactions where the halogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced by phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of aryl halides in this type of reaction, known as a Grignard cross-coupling, is dependent on the halogen. The general order of reactivity is I > Br > Cl > F, which corresponds to the carbon-halogen bond strength (C-I is the weakest). This means the iodine atom will react first, followed by the two bromine atoms.\n\nThe step-by-step process is as follows:\n1.  **First Substitution:** The most reactive site is the carbon-iodine bond. One equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide will react with 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene to replace the iodine atom with a phenyl group, forming 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Second and Third Substitutions:** The reaction conditions specify \"excess\" phenyl magnesium bromide and \"refluxing,\" indicating that the reaction is driven to completion. The less reactive bromine atoms will then be substituted by phenyl groups. Two more equivalents of phenyl magnesium bromide will react to replace the two bromine atoms, resulting in the final product.\n\nThe overall reaction can be summarized as the replacement of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups. This forms a benzene ring with three adjacent phenyl substituents.\n\nThe final product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. Therefore, the IUPAC name of the product is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
