    "Based on the information gathered, the Oscar-nominated film that features a character sealing his fate in a manner closely resembling the described scene is **Michael Clayton**.\n\nThe 2007 film, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, tells the story of Arthur Edens (played by Tom Wilkinson, who received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his role), a brilliant but mentally unstable lawyer. After having a manic episode while representing a chemical company in a class-action lawsuit, Edens becomes a liability to his powerful law firm.\n\nWhile a direct quote of \"Thank you\" upon boarding a bus that seals his fate is not explicitly confirmed in the search results, a presentation on the film contains a slide that reads \"Arthur Edens: I am Shiva, the god of death. THANK YOU\". This, combined with scenes of his erratic behavior in public spaces, including wandering through Times Square where buses are present, strongly suggests this is the film the user is referencing. Arthur's increasingly unpredictable actions, driven by a moral awakening, ultimately lead to his murder, which is staged to look like a suicide. His decision to stop taking his medication and expose the guilt of his firm's client sets in motion the tragic events that seal his fate.\n\nIt is possible the specific detail of saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is a misremembered element of his public breakdown. However, the core elements of an Oscar-nominated film and a character whose fate is sealed due to his public defiance align with the events in *Michael Clayton*.\n\n<<<Michael Clayton>>>"
