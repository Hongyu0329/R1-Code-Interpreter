    "After a gene duplication event, the new gene copy is often redundant. The most common fate for such a copy is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene (pseudogenization). However, several mechanisms can lead to the retention and divergence of both gene copies. Let's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange between similar DNA sequences, such as duplicated genes. Gene conversion tends to homogenize the two copies, making them more similar. While it can sometimes create novel chimeric alleles, its primary role is often seen as working against divergence, a process known as concerted evolution. Therefore, it is not the main mechanism responsible for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which one of the duplicate copies becomes inactivated by mutations. This represents the *loss* of a functional gene copy, not its retention in a way that contributes to functional divergence of the pair. It is the most frequent outcome, but it's a failure to retain both functional genes.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. Occasionally, these mutations can lead to the evolution of a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection then preserves this new gene, leading to the retention and functional divergence of the duplicated pair. This is a key mechanism for evolutionary innovation.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., it was active in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that knock out different sub-functions. Eventually, both genes become essential because they partition the original functions of the single ancestral gene between them. This process, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, leads to the retention of both copies through a typically neutral process.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary process where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for such diversification, adaptive radiation itself is a pattern of speciation at the organismal level, not a molecular mechanism for retaining individual genes within a genome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted as the major mechanisms responsible for the long-term preservation and functional divergence of duplicated genes. They represent the two primary pathways for duplicate genes to avoid being lost. Subfunctionalization provides a neutral pathway for preservation by making both copies necessary to fulfill the original set of functions, while neofunctionalization is an adaptive process where one copy gains a novel function. Both are significant, but they represent the most direct and widely cited mechanisms for the phenomenon described in the question among the choices given. Given that both are core models, and the question asks for the \"most likely,\" it implies a choice between the most established explanations. Subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization are the textbook models for this process.\n\n<<<D>>>"
