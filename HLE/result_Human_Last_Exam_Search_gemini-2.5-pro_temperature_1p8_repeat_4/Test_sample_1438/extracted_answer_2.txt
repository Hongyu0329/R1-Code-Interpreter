The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a single numerical value but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. For a single Grassmann variable θ, the integration measure dθ is defined by the relations: ∫ dθ = 0 and ∫ θ dθ = 1. This set of rules ensures that the integration has the correct properties to be consistent with the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables (θiθj = -θjθi and θi² = 0), which is the mathematical formulation of the Pauli exclusion principle within the path integral formalism.
