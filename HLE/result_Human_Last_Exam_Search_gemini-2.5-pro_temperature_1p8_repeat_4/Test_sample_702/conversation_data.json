    "The connectivity of the specified map is determined by analyzing a canonical composition of maps derived from the fundamental properties of loop spaces, suspensions, and smash products.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Spaces and the Map\nFirst, we identify the topological spaces involved:\n*   **Loop space `ΩS^n`**: The space of loops on the n-sphere. The connectivity of `ΩS^n` is `(n-2)`. Thus, `ΩS^4` is 2-connected and `ΩS^6` is 4-connected.\n*   **Suspension `ΣX`**: The suspension of a space X.\n*   **Smash product `X ∧ Y`**: A quotient of the product space `X × Y`. We use the property that `S^m ∧ S^n` is homotopy equivalent to `S^(m+n)`. Therefore, the target space `Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)` is homotopy equivalent to `ΩS^{10}`.\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of a map `f: Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)`. While the description \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" is ambiguous, we can interpret this as the most natural map constructed from the canonical maps associated with the functors involved. This canonical map can be seen as a composition of three standard maps in homotopy theory.\n\n### 2. Construction of the Canonical Map\nThe map `f` can be constructed as the following composition:\n`f: Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) \\xrightarrow{h} ΣΩS^4 ∧ ΣΩS^6 \\xrightarrow{\\varepsilon_{S^4} \\wedge \\varepsilon_{S^6}} S^4 ∧ S^6 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} ΩΣ(S^4 ∧ S^6)`\n\nLet's break down each component:\n1.  **Map `h`**: This is the natural map `h: Σ(A ∧ B) → ΣA ∧ ΣB`, where `A=ΩS^4` and `B=ΩS^6`. The connectivity of this map is determined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber, which is `Σ(A*B)` (the suspension of the join of A and B). The connectivity of the join is `conn(A) + conn(B) + 1`.\n2.  **Map `ε_{S^4} ∧ ε_{S^6}`**: This is the smash product of the counit maps of the (Σ, Ω) adjunction, `ε_X: ΣΩX → X`, which are also called evaluation maps.\n3.  **Map `α`**: This is the unit map of the (Σ, Ω) adjunction, `α_Y: Y → ΩΣY`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Connectivity of Each Component\nA map is defined as `k`-connected if it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups `π_i` for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to its homotopy fiber being `(k-1)`-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of `h`**:\n    *   `ΩS^4` is 2-connected and `ΩS^6` is 4-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of the fiber `Σ(ΩS^4 * ΩS^6)` is `conn(ΩS^4) + conn(ΩS^6) + 1 + 1 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8`.\n    *   Therefore, the map `h` is **9-connected**.\n\n*   **Connectivity of `ε_{S^4} ∧ ε_{S^6}`**:\n    *   The fiber of `ε_{S^n}: ΣΩS^n → S^n` is `ΩS^{2n-1}`.\n    *   For `ε_{S^4}`, the fiber `ΩS^7` is `(7-2)=5`-connected, so `ε_{S^4}` is **6-connected**.\n    *   For `ε_{S^6}`, the fiber `ΩS^{11}` is `(11-2)=9`-connected, so `ε_{S^6}` is **10-connected**.\n    *   The connectivity of the smash product of these maps is `conn(ε_{S^4}) + conn(ε_{S^6}) + 1 = 6 + 10 + 1 = 17`. The composed map is therefore **17-connected**.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the composition `E = (ε_{S^4} ∧ ε_{S^6}) ∘ h`**:\n    *   The connectivity of a composition of maps is the minimum of their individual connectivities.\n    *   `conn(E) = min(conn(h), conn(ε_{S^4} ∧ ε_{S^6})) = min(9, 17) = 9`.\n    *   So, we have a 9-connected map `E: Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) → S^4 ∧ S^6 ≃ S^{10}`.\n\n*   **Connectivity of `α`**:\n    *   The final map in the sequence is `α: S^{10} → ΩΣS^{10} ≃ ΩS^{11}`.\n    *   The induced map on homotopy groups is `π_k(S^{10}) → π_k(ΩS^{11}) ≅ π_{k+1}(S^{11})`.\n    *   By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, this is an isomorphism for `k < 2(10) - 1 = 19` and a surjection for `k=19`.\n    *   Thus, the map `α` is **19-connected**.\n\n### 4. Final Result\nThe connectivity of the total map `f = α ∘ E` is the minimum of the connectivities of `E` and `α`.\n\nConnectivity(f) = min(Connectivity(E), Connectivity(α)) = min(9, 19) = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
