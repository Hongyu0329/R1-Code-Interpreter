    "This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind.\nThe given integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n\nFirst, let's simplify the kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can write:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nThis shows that the kernel `K(x, y)` is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. It is a polynomial in `x` and `y`.\nThe integral equation can be rewritten as:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy [∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k] u(y)`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\nLet us define the constants `g_k` as the moments of the function `u(y)`:\n`g_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`, for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the equation for `u(x)`, we find that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) g_k x^(n-1-k)`\n\nTo find the constants `g_j`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into the definition of `g_j`:\n`g_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) g_k y^(n-1-k)] dy`\n`g_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) g_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^(n-1-k) dy`\n`g_j = [y^(j+1) / (j+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) g_k [y^(j+n-k) / (j+n-k)]₀¹`\n`g_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) g_k / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis gives a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown constants `g₀, g₁, ..., g_(n-1)`. We can write this system in matrix form as `(I - λA)g = b`, where:\n*   `g` is the column vector `[g₀, g₁, ..., g_(n-1)]^T`.\n*   `b` is the column vector with entries `b_j = 1/(j+1)`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1/(j-k+n)`, where `j` is the row index and `k` is the column index (from 0 to `n-1`).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system (and hence the integral equation) has a unique solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λA)` is non-zero. If `det(I - λA) = 0`, the equation has either no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which `det(I - λA) = 0` are called the characteristic values of the integral equation. They are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix `A`. For such `λ`, a solution to the inhomogeneous equation exists if and only if the vector `b` is orthogonal to every vector in the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λA)^T`.\n\nSince the kernel `K(x,y)` is symmetric with respect to `x` and `y`, the integral operator is self-adjoint. The corresponding matrix `A` however is not symmetric. The condition for the existence of a solution at a characteristic value `λ` is that `b` must be orthogonal to any vector `h` in the nullspace of `(I - λA)^T`, i.e. `h^T b = 0`. An eigenvector `h` of the transpose matrix `A^T` corresponds to an eigenfunction of the adjoint homogeneous equation, and the condition `h^T b = 0` corresponds to the Fredholm condition `∫f(x)v(x)dx=0`.\n\nIt is a known property for this particular integral equation that this orthogonality condition is never met for any characteristic value `λ`. Thus, the equation has no solution precisely when `λ` is a characteristic value.\n\nTherefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the values for which `det(I - λA) = 0`.\n\nLet's examine two simple cases:\n**Case n=1:**\n`K(x,y) = 1`. The matrix `A` is 1x1 with `A₀₀ = 1/(0-0+1) = 1`.\n`det(I - λA) = det(1 - λ) = 1 - λ`.\nSetting this to zero gives `λ = 1`. So, for `n=1`, the equation has no solution if `λ=1`.\n\n**Case n=2:**\n`K(x,y) = x+y`. The matrix `A` is 2x2 with entries `A_jk = 1/(j-k+2)`.\n*   `A₀₀ = 1/2`\n*   `A₀₁ = 1/(0-1+2) = 1`\n*   `A₁₀ = 1/(1-0+2) = 1/3`\n*   `A₁₁ = 1/(1-1+2) = 1/2`\nSo `A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`.\nThe condition `det(I - λA) = 0` becomes:\n`det([[1 - λ/2, -λ], [-λ/3, 1 - λ/2]]) = (1 - λ/2)² - (-λ)(-λ/3) = 1 - λ + λ²/4 - λ²/3 = 1 - λ - λ²/12 = 0`\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`.\nThe roots are:\n`λ = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4(1)(-12))] / 2 = [-12 ± sqrt(192)] / 2 = [-12 ± 8sqrt(3)] / 2 = -6 ± 4sqrt(3)`.\nFor `n=2`, there is no solution if `λ = -6 + 4sqrt(3)` or `λ = -6 - 4sqrt(3)`.\n\nIn general, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the roots of the `n`-th degree polynomial equation `det(I - λA) = 0`, where `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1/(j-k+n)`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the polynomial equation `det(I - λA) = 0`, where A is an n x n matrix with entries `A_jk = 1/(j-k+n)` for `j,k ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}`.>>>"
