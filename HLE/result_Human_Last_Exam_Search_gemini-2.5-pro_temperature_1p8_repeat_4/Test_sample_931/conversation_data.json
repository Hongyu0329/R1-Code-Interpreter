Fungus:** There is no scientific record of adult snakeflies feeding on fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** The same New Zealand study noted snakeflies feeding on the *drupes* (fruits) of the Karamū tree, but not the leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are known predators of aphids, and the New Zealand study specifically recorded them preying on aphids found on the Tōtara tree.\n\nBoth Nectar (A) and Totara Aphids (E) are documented food sources for adult snakeflies.\n\n<<<F>>>"
