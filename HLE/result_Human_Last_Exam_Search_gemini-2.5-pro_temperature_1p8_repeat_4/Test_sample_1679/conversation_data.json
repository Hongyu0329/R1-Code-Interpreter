    "An American in Paris, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film to hold that honor to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.\n\nThe film, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, culminates in a 17-minute ballet sequence that portrays a dream-like vision of Paris. This extended scene was designed to evoke the style of French Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy and features a stylized, two-dimensional representation of the Place de la Concorde, which includes the iconic Luxor Obelisk. A model of the Place de la Concorde's fountain was also created and used for planning the elaborate choreography and camera work of this final ballet.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners, such as *Gigi* (1958), were also filmed in Paris and featured the Place de la Concorde, *An American in Paris* predates them. A review of Best Picture winners from the preceding decade, including *The Song of Bernadette* (1943), *Going My Way* (1944), *The Lost Weekend* (1945), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), *Gentleman's Agreement* (1947), *Hamlet* (1948), *All the King's Men* (1949), and *All About Eve* (1950), reveals that their filming locations were primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom, with no evidence of scenes depicting either the Luxor Obelisk in Paris or its counterpart in Luxor, Egypt.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
