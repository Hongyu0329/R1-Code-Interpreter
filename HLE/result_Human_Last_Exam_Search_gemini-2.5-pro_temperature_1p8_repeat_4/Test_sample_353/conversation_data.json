    "The A($\\alpha$)-stability angle of a Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) method is a measure of its stability for solving stiff ordinary differential equations. For the BDFk methods with k > 2, the region of absolute stability is not the entire left-half of the complex plane, meaning they are not A-stable. However, their stability region does contain an angular sector defined by $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$, and the largest such angle $\\alpha$ is the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle.\n\nFor the BDF4 scheme, this angle has been a subject of study, with numerical calculations providing close approximations. Notably, exact analytical expressions for these angles have been derived. The process involves parameterizing the boundary of the stability region and finding the angle of the tangent to this boundary from the origin.\n\nRecent work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and further simplified by Gander and Wanner, provides the exact value for the A($\\alpha$) stability angle for BDF methods. For BDF4, the value of the cosine of this angle is given by:\n\n$\\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{17\\sqrt{2033} - 155}{1152}$\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ can therefore be expressed exactly in radians using the arccosine function. The tangent of the angle $\\alpha$ has also been derived. Given that $\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\sec^2(\\alpha) - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(\\alpha)} - 1$, we can find an exact expression for $\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\nFor BDF4, the exact value for $\\tan(\\alpha)$ is:\n\n$\\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sqrt{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}}{6\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\arctan()$ is:\n\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}}{6\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$\n\nNumerically, this corresponds to an angle of approximately 73.35Â°.\n\n<<<$ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}}{6\\sqrt{3}}\\right) $>>>"
