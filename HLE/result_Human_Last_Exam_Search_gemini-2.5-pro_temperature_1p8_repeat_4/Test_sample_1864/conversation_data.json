    "The previous searches have provided a solid foundation on general flow cytometry controls and have introduced the use of beads, including streptavidin beads, primarily in the context of compensation and cell capture. The key takeaway is that beads can be used as surrogates for cells in creating single-stain compensation controls, which is particularly useful when dealing with rare cell populations or low antigen expression. However, some critical information is still missing to provide a comprehensive answer tailored to the user's specific experiment.\n\nSpecifically, I need to understand:\n1.  How to create an appropriate \"unstained\" or \"beads alone\" control. Streptavidin beads themselves might have some level of autofluorescence which needs to be accounted for. It's important to clarify if running the beads alone, without any fluorochromes, is the correct negative control.\n2.  How to practically prepare single-stain controls using streptavidin beads for each of the five fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750). The search results mention using antibody-capture beads for compensation, but the user's experiment involves streptavidin beads which bind to biotinylated antibodies. The process of creating single-stain controls in this specific context needs to be clearly outlined.\n3.  Whether a viability dye is necessary when sorting based on bead-bound targets, as opposed to direct cell staining. The searches emphasize the importance of viability dyes to exclude dead cells which can non-specifically bind antibodies. It's unclear if this is still a critical control when the target is captured on a bead.\n4.  Whether FMO (Fluorescence Minus One) controls are still necessary when using beads for sorting. FMO controls are crucial for setting gates in multicolor experiments, especially with overlapping spectra. It needs to be confirmed if this principle applies directly to a bead-based sorting experiment.\n5.  If isotype controls are relevant in a streptavidin-bead system. Isotype controls are used to assess non-specific antibody binding. In a system where the primary antibody is biotinylated and binds to streptavidin, the nature of non-specific binding might be different, and the utility of a traditional isotype control needs to be evaluated.\n\nTo address these missing pieces of information, I will update the plan.The executed step has provided crucial information regarding controls for flow cytometry when using streptavidin beads, particularly in the context of a multi-color experiment. The search results have clarified the use of unstained controls (beads alone to check for autofluorescence), the necessity and preparation of single-stain compensation controls (using antibody-capture beads as a valid approach), the continued importance of a viability dye, the requirement for FMO controls for accurate gating, and the role of isotype controls in a biotin-streptavidin system. I now have a comprehensive understanding of the different types of controls and their specific implementation in this experimental setup. Therefore, I can proceed to synthesize this information and provide a final answer without needing further searches.\nI have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\nFor a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, a comprehensive set of controls is essential for accurate data interpretation and successful sorting. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare, which amounts to a minimum of 13 control samples, with the potential for more depending on the specifics of your experiment.\n\n### Essential Controls for Your Experiment:\n\nA minimum of **13 controls** are essential for proper setup and analysis of your five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment with streptavidin beads. These controls ensure accurate compensation for spectral overlap, correct gating of positive populations, and assessment of background and non-specific binding.\n\nHere is a detailed list of the necessary controls:\n\n**1. Unstained Controls (2 Samples):**\n\n*   **Unstained Cells:** This sample contains only your cells, without any antibodies or streptavidin beads. It is crucial for assessing the natural autofluorescence of your cells and setting the initial gates to distinguish cells from debris.\n*   **Streptavidin Beads Alone:** It is important to run a sample of just the streptavidin beads to determine their intrinsic autofluorescence. This helps in distinguishing true signal from any background fluorescence contributed by the beads themselves.\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 Samples):**\n\nFor a five-color experiment, you will need a single-stain control for each fluorochrome in your panel to correctly calculate compensation for spectral overlap between the channels. In your case, this involves:\n\n*   **AF350 Compensation Control:** This can be prepared using compensation beads that bind the AF350-conjugated antibody.\n*   **GFP Compensation Control:** For GFP, which is expressed by the cells, you will use a sample of your cells that are positive for GFP expression.\n*   **PE Compensation Control:** Prepared using compensation beads and a PE-conjugated antibody.\n*   **AF647 Compensation Control:** Prepared using compensation beads and an AF647-conjugated antibody.\n*   **AF750 Compensation Control:** Prepared using compensation beads and an AF750-conjugated antibody.\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 Samples):**\n\nFMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for dim or rare populations, by revealing the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the channel of interest. You should prepare an FMO control for each of the five fluorochromes in your panel:\n\n*   **FMO-AF350:** Cells stained with all fluorochromes except for the one detected in the AF350 channel.\n*   **FMO-GFP:** Cells stained with all fluorochromes except for GFP.\n*   **FMO-PE:** Cells stained with all fluorochromes except for PE.\n*   **FMO-AF647:** Cells stained with all fluorochromes except for AF647.\n*   **FMO-AF750:** Cells stained with all fluorochromes except for AF750.\n\n**4. Viability Dye Control (1 Sample):**\n\n*   A viability dye is essential to exclude dead cells from your analysis, as dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. You should have a sample of your cells stained only with the viability dye to set the gate for live cells.\n\n**Optional but Recommended Controls:**\n\n*   **Isotype Controls:** While their use is debated, isotype controls can be valuable for assessing the non-specific binding of your primary antibodies. If you choose to use them, you would need an isotype control for each of your primary antibodies conjugated to a fluorochrome, which would add to your total number of controls.\n*   **Biological Controls:** These include positive and negative control cell lines or samples that are known to express or not express the markers of interest. These controls validate that your staining protocol is working as expected.\n\nBy preparing these essential controls, you will be well-equipped to perform a robust and reliable five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads.\n\n<<<13>>>"
