    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 99. The BCH formula, which expresses the solution Z for e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y, has a number of terms at each order that is well-defined.\n\nThe number of independent commutators of a certain order, and thus the number of non-zero coefficients, can be determined. For order *n*, this is given by the Witt formula, which relates to the number of basic Lie brackets. A sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), A005489, directly corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients of order *n* in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. For n=10, the value listed is 99.\n\nThis value is derived from the mathematical structure of free Lie algebras. While the explicit formula and its derivation are complex, involving concepts such as Lyndon words and the MÃ¶bius function, the result for order 10 is firmly established in mathematical literature.\n\nIt is worth noting that different bases can be used for the expansion, which could theoretically change the number of non-vanishing coefficients. However, standard formulations consistently lead to this number.\n\n<<<99>>>"
