    "While various theologians have discussed miracles and their relation to the laws of nature, it was the medieval theologian **Thomas Aquinas** (c. 1225–1274) who first developed a specialized, systematic terminology to describe events that occur outside the normal course of nature. This framework is applicable to understanding both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential changes in natural laws at the time of the Fall.\n\nAquinas defined a miracle as an event brought about by divine power that is apart from the order commonly observed in nature. He meticulously categorized miracles into three ranks, providing a nuanced vocabulary to describe alterations to the natural order:\n*   **First Rank:** Acts that God performs which nature is entirely incapable of, such as the sun moving backward in the sky or a virgin conceiving. The virgin birth of Jesus clearly falls into this category.\n*   **Second Rank:** Acts that God performs which nature could theoretically do, but not in that specific sequence or manner. An example would be a person who was lame from birth suddenly walking.\n*   **Third Rank:** Acts that God performs which nature could also accomplish, but in the miraculous instance are done without the operation of natural principles, such as an instantaneous recovery from a fever that could have healed naturally over time.\n\nThis Thomistic framework allows for a detailed description of how God can act outside of the established laws of nature, which Aquinas understood as the predictable, God-ordained functioning of creation. While Augustine of Hippo, a major influence on Aquinas, wrote about the virgin birth being \"contrary to nature\", he tended to define miracles more broadly as unusual events that defy our accustomed view of nature's course rather than developing the kind of systematic, ranked terminology that Aquinas later formulated.\n\nIn Aquinas's theological system, the \"laws of nature\" are part of the \"eternal law\" which is God's wisdom. The Fall of humanity, for Aquinas, resulted in a wounding of human nature, introducing disorder into human inclinations and relationship with God. While he did not frame the consequences of the Fall as a \"change in the laws of nature\" in the same way as a first-rank miracle, his structured understanding of natural law provided the theological vocabulary to describe how human nature, originally in harmony with God's law, came to be in a state of disharmony and subject to suffering and death—a state different from its original constitution. Thus, his terminology for divine action and his understanding of natural law provided a comprehensive framework applicable to both the unique miracle of the virgin birth and the altered state of nature after the Fall.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
