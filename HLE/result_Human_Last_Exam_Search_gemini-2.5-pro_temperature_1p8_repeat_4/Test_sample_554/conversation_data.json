    "A hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\" would be a nanocar molecule where all hydrogen atoms attached to its carbon framework have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The exact number of fluorine atoms would depend on the specific structure of the nanocar in question, as different nanocar designs have different numbers of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor a prominent example, a well-characterized nanocar synthesized at Rice University has the molecular formula C430H274O12. This nanocar features a complex chassis with long decyloxy side chains, which enhance its solubility. In a perfluorinated version of this molecule, each of the 274 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with a fluorine atom. Therefore, this particular perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is important to note that other nanocar structures exist. For instance, a simpler, computationally studied \"flexible nanocar\" has the formula C310H34. If this nanocar were to be perfluorinated, it would contain 34 fluorine atoms. The wheels of these nanocars are often C60 fullerene molecules, which are composed entirely of carbon and have no hydrogen atoms, so they are not subject to this type of fluorination.\n\n<<<274>>>"
