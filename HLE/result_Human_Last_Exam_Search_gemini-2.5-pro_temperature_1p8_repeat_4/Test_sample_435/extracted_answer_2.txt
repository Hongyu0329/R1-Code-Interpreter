Given the body of evidence, the prediction is that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit a more robust and sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of CAR T cells into a potent, less exhausted, and memory-rich phenotype, leading to enhanced effector functions, including cytokine secretion.
