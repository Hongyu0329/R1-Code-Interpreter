    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of the neutron noise in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as G(r, t), describes the correlation of particle (in this case, neutron) densities at different positions and times. Its double Fourier transform with respect to both space (r) and time (t) yields the dynamic structure factor, S(Q, Ï‰), a concept widely used in condensed matter physics to describe the results of scattering experiments.\n\nIn the field of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, the analysis of fluctuations in the neutron population is referred to as \"neutron noise\" analysis. This analysis provides crucial information about the reactor's kinetic parameters. The correlation between neutron detections, which is fundamentally described by the pair correlation function, can be measured using several techniques, including the Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha methods.\n\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the neutron noise represents the frequency content of these fluctuations. It is mathematically equivalent to the double Fourier transform of the time-dependent pair correlation function. Analysis of the PSD is a standard technique in zero-power reactor noise analysis, alongside methods like Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha, to determine key reactor parameters such as the prompt neutron decay constant.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the neutron noise>>>"
