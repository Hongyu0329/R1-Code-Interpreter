The key residues on the beta-1 subunit for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are located within the guanylate kinase (GK) domain and form a hydrophobic binding pocket. While specific residue numbers for the human beta-1 in complex with Cav2.3 are best determined by analyzing the PDB structure 7YG5, mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of conserved hydrophobic residues in this pocket. For gating modulation, the entire GK domain is critical, as its binding to the alpha-1 subunit's AID is the primary mechanism for this regulation. Specific surface-charged residues outside the main binding pocket also contribute to the fine-tuning of gating.
