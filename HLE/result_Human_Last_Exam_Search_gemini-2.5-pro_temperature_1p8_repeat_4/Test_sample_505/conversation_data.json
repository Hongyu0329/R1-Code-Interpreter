    "In a surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the topology of the surface, specifically by creating holes or defects. For a planar surface code, a simple rule is that each hole with a closed boundary can encode one logical qubit.\n\nThe user's question specifies two separate patches of surface code, with each patch having two holes. Following the principle that one hole encodes one logical qubit, each patch would encode:\n\n2 holes/patch * 1 logical qubit/hole = 2 logical qubits per patch.\n\nSince there are two such patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch:\n\n2 logical qubits/patch * 2 patches = 4 logical qubits.\n\nIt's worth noting that while creating a pair of holes is a common method to define a single logical qubit for operational convenience, a single patch with 'n' holes can theoretically encode 'n' logical qubits. Therefore, two patches with two holes each can encode a total of four logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
