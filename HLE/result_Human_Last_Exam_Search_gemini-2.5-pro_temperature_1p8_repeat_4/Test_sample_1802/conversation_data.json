    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix into another qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and Kraus Operators:**\n    A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{i,j} U_{i,j} \\rho U_{i,j}^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_{i,j}\\}$ is a probability distribution (i.e., $p_{i,j} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{i,j} p_{i,j} = 1$), and $\\{U_{i,j}\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (also known as Weyl operators). These operators form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n    The Kraus operators for this channel can be written as $A_{i,j} = \\sqrt{p_{i,j}} U_{i,j}$. Let's use a single index $\\alpha$ to represent the pair $(i,j)$, so the Kraus operators are $\\{A_\\alpha = \\sqrt{p_\\alpha} U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2}$.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:**\n    For a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_\\alpha\\}$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ describes the information that leaks to the environment. The rank of the complementary channel is defined as the dimension of the linear space spanned by the operators $\\{A_\\beta^\\dagger A_\\alpha\\}$ for all pairs of indices $\\alpha, \\beta$.\n    Rank$(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{A_\\beta^\\dagger A_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha,\\beta})$.\n\n3.  **Maximizing the Rank:**\n    To find the maximal possible rank, we can choose the Pauli channel's parameters, the probabilities $\\{p_\\alpha\\}$, to maximize this dimension. Let's consider a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero ($p_\\alpha > 0$ for all $\\alpha=1, \\dots, d^2$). A prime example of such a channel is the depolarizing channel with a depolarization probability $p$ where $0 < p < 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Maximal Rank:**\n    With $p_\\alpha > 0$ for all $\\alpha$, the operators spanning the complementary channel's output space are $\\{ \\sqrt{p_\\beta p_\\alpha} U_\\beta^\\dagger U_\\alpha \\}$. Since all the scalar coefficients $\\sqrt{p_\\beta p_\\alpha}$ are non-zero, the dimension of the span of these operators is the same as the dimension of the span of $\\{U_\\beta^\\dagger U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha,\\beta}$.\n    $\\text{Rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{U_\\beta^\\dagger U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha,\\beta})$.\n\n    The set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ forms a basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. One of these operators is the identity operator, let's call it $U_0 = I$.\n\n    Now consider the subset of products where we fix one of the operators to be the identity, for example, $\\{U_0^\\dagger U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2}$. This set is simply $\\{I^\\dagger U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^{d^2}$.\n    This subset of operators, the generalized Pauli operators themselves, is a basis for the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. The dimension of the span of this subset is therefore $d^2$.\n\n    Since a subset of the set $\\{U_\\beta^\\dagger U_\\alpha\\}$ already spans the entire $d \\times d$ matrix space, the span of the full set must also be the entire space. The dimension of the space of $d \\times d$ matrices is $d^2$.\n\n    Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$. This upper bound is achievable for any Pauli channel that is a mixture of all $d^2$ generalized Pauli errors with non-zero probabilities.\n\nÂ«<$d^2$>>>"
