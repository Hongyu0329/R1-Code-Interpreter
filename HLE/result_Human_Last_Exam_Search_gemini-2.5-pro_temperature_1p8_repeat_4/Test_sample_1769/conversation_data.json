    "### Without Viking Influence, \"Sister\" Would Likely Be \"Suster\" or \"Swester\" in Modern English\n\nHad the Norse never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely be \"suster\" or \"swester,\" rather than \"sister.\" This is based on the linguistic evolution of the original Old English words for the concept, free from the influence of Old Norse.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a direct descendant of the Old English word \"sweostor,\" which also had dialectical variations such as \"swuster\" and the Northumbrian \"soester.\" All of these terms ultimately originate from the Proto-Germanic `*swestr-`, making them cognates with other Germanic words for sister, such as the German \"Schwester\" and the Dutch \"zuster\".\n\nThe form of the modern word \"sister,\" particularly its \"i\" vowel, is attributed to the influence of the Old Norse word \"systir\". Old Norse was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers, and due to the linguistic similarities between Old English and Old Norse, many words were either exchanged or influenced each other. The word \"sister\" is a prime example of this linguistic blending.\n\nWithout this Norse influence, \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\" would have followed the natural sound changes that occurred as Old English evolved into Middle and then Modern English.\n\nThe Old English \"sweostor,\" pronounced roughly as /ˈswe͜os.tor/, would have seen its \"eo\" diphthong change. In Middle English, the \"eo\" sound typically became \"e\". This is evident in other words from the period, such as \"freond\" which became \"friend.\" Following this pattern, \"sweostor\" would likely have evolved into \"swester\" in Middle English, which could have carried into the modern day.\n\nThe alternative Old English form, \"swuster,\" would have undergone a different evolution. The \"u\" sound in Old English often shifted to \"o\" or remained as \"u\" in Middle English, as seen in the word \"suster\" which was a common Middle English form. Examples of similar vowel shifts include Old English \"cuman\" becoming \"come\". Therefore, \"swuster\" would have likely evolved into \"suster\" or even \"soster\".\n\nEvidence from Middle English texts shows a variety of spellings for sister, including \"suster,\" \"soster,\" and \"swuster,\" before the \"i\" form, influenced by the Old Norse \"systir,\" became dominant. These forms reflect the natural linguistic drift of the original Old English words.\n\nThus, in a timeline without Norse contact, English speakers today would almost certainly be referring to their female siblings as \"suster\" or \"swester.\"\n\n<<<suster or swester>>>"
