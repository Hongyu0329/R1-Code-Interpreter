    "Answering your question requires clarifying the terms and the context in which they are used. The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ suggests the maximum norm, or sup-norm, of a function, while the covolume $V$ in the context of a squarefree natural number $N$ typically relates to the geometry of modular curves. The relevant setting to connect these concepts is the theory of automorphic forms, specifically Hecke-Maass cusp forms for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$.\n\nHere, we interpret $k_{k,\\infty}$ as the sup-norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$. The covolume $V$ is the volume of the modular curve $X_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane.\n\n### Covolume for Squarefree Level N\n\nFor a squarefree natural number $N$, the covolume (or volume) of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ is given by the exact formula:\n\n$V = \\text{vol}(X_0(N)) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$\n\nwhere the product is over the prime divisors of $N$. From this formula, we can see that the covolume $V$ is directly related to $N$. Since for any prime $p$, $1 < 1 + 1/p \\le 3/2$, we have that $N$ is a lower bound for $V$ (up to a constant factor), and $V$ is roughly proportional to $N$.\n\n### Sup-Norm Bounds\n\nThe problem of finding an upper bound for the sup-norm of Hecke-Maass cusp forms is a significant area of research in number theory. For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and with a fixed Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the best-known upper bound in terms of the level $N$ was established by N. Templier. This result states:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$\n\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$. The notation $\\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon}$ means that the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the choice of $\\epsilon$. Specifically, for a squarefree integer, the bound is $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}\\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon}$.\n\n### The Upper Bound in Relation to Covolume\n\nSince the covolume $V$ is of the order of $N$, we can express the upper bound for the sup-norm in terms of $V$. Given that $N < \\frac{3}{\\pi} V$, the bound can be written as:\n\n$k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$\n\nThis inequality provides the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for squarefree natural numbers $N$ in the context of Hecke-Maass newforms.\n\n<<<An upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for a squarefree natural number $N$ is given by the relation $k_{k,\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$, where $\\lambda$ is the Laplacian eigenvalue of the associated Maass form and $\\epsilon$ is any positive number.>>>"
