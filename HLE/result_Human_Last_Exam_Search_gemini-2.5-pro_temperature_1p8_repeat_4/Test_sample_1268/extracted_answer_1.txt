An upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for a squarefree natural number $N$ is given by the relation $k_{k,\infty} \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} V^{1/3 + \epsilon}$, where $\lambda$ is the Laplacian eigenvalue of the associated Maass form and $\epsilon$ is any positive number.
