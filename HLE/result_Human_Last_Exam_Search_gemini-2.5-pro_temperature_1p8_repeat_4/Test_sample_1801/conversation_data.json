    "Two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why\":\n\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in the commercials were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann**, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969, and economist **Amartya Sen**, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was part of Enron's broader effort to portray itself as an innovative and forward-thinking company. The commercials featured a series of disjointed images and the tagline \"Ask Why.\" One of the commercials included brief appearances by both Gell-Mann and Sen. Several sources confirm Murray Gell-Mann's participation in the advertising campaign. While direct video confirmation of Amartya Sen's appearance is less common in the search results, he is identified as the other Nobel laureate in the commercial alongside Gell-Mann.\n\nIt is worth noting that another Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman, had a connection with Enron, serving on its advisory board in 1999 for which he was paid. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Krugman appeared in the \"Ask Why\" commercials.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
