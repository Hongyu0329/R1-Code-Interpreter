    "A significant distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. While both techniques emphasize a bend from the waist, the approach to hip alignment reflects the broader principles of each method.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a square and stable torso and hips. This principle of a strong, aligned core is fundamental to the technique and would be maintained during a cambré derrière to ensure control and stability throughout the movement. The backbend is initiated from an upward lift of the torso, with the hips remaining squarely placed.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is characterized by a more dynamic and open aesthetic, which includes the use of an open hip, particularly notable in arabesques. In Balanchine's style, the hip is often considered an extension of the leg to create the illusion of a higher or more dramatic line. This philosophy allows for a greater range of movement in the torso and can result in a deeper or more fluid backbend in a cambré derrière, as the hips are not strictly required to remain square. One source describes the Balanchine style as having a \"notable arabesque with an open hip that faces the audience, rather than forming positions around a square and symmetrical torso\".\n\nOther differences exist between the two methods, such as the speed of movement, with Balanchine often favoring faster, more athletic execution, and distinct stylistic elements in arm and head placement. However, the foundational difference in the use of the hips during movements to the back is a key distinguishing feature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
