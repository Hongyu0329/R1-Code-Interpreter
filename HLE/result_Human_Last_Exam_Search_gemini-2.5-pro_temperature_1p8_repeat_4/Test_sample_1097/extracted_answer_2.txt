The set M is the Banach space of continuous functions on the interval that vanish at the endpoints x=0 and x=1, endowed with the supremum norm. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

**M = {u ∈ C() | u(0) = u(1) = 0}**

This set, equipped with the metric d(u, v) = supₓ |u(x) - v(x)|, forms a complete metric space, which is a necessary condition for the application of the Banach fixed-point theorem.
