    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are other lobes within the same functional group, known as the palliovisceral lobe complex. This complex is located in the posterior part of the subesophageal mass, which controls various motor and visceral functions.\n\nThe lobes situated posteriorly adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe include:\n*   **Posterior Chromatophore Lobes**: These lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) and papillae (skin texture) on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass. Their location in the posterior subesophageal mass places them near the palliovisceral lobe.\n*   **Fin Lobes**: These control the movement of the fins.\n*   **Vasomotor Lobes (Dorsal and Ventral)**: These lobes are also part of the same complex.\n*   **Lateral Ventral Palliovisceral Lobes**: Another component of the palliovisceral complex.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements and the ejection of ink. The entire palliovisceral lobe complex is a key part of the lower motor control system for locomotion. The entire brain is encased posteriorly by rigid cartilage.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, fin lobes, vasomotor lobes, and lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes.>>>"
