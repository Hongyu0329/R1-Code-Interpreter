    "The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction:** The reaction is a Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde ((CH₃)₃CCHO) and an ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane (Ph₃P=CHCH₂-Ar, where Ar = 2-chlorophenyl). The reaction correctly yields an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The alkene is formed by replacing the carbonyl oxygen with the ylide's carbanion group.\n\n2.  **Product Structure:** The resulting alkene structure is (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl).\n\n3.  **Product IUPAC Name:** The IUPAC name for this structure is `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`. I have verified this through my own analysis and confirmed that similar compound structures exist.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The ylide `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-Ar` has an alkyl-type group on the carbanionic carbon and is therefore considered an \"unstabilized\" or \"non-stabilized\" ylide. For reactions involving unstabilized ylides with aldehydes, the major product is generally the (Z)-alkene (cis-isomer). This stereoselectivity arises from kinetic control during the irreversible formation of the oxaphosphetane intermediate. Under typical, salt-free conditions, the (Z)-isomer is favored. Therefore, the major product is `(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n\nThe final product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is primarily **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Chemical Structure:**\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** (CH₃)₃C-CHO\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Ylide):** Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)\n*   **Reaction:** (CH₃)₃C-CHO + Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl) → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl) + Ph₃PO\n\nThe product is an alkene.\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Wittig reagent used is an unstabilized ylide. Unstabilized ylides typically react with aldehydes under standard conditions to form the (Z)-alkene as the major product.\n\nTherefore, the principal product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nFinal check: The reactants are correct. The Wittig reaction mechanism is correctly applied. The product structure is correct. The IUPAC name is correct. The stereochemical outcome is correctly predicted based on the nature of the ylide.\n\nI'm ready for the final answer.\nThe reaction of pivalaldehyde with (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is a Wittig reaction.\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃CCHO.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is an ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-C₆H₄Cl, where the chloro group is at the 2-position of the phenyl ring. This is classified as an unstabilized ylide because the carbon of the P=C bond is attached to an alkyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction product:**\n    *   In a Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group is exchanged with the carbanionic part of the ylide, forming an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃PO) as a byproduct.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the product is formed by joining the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon to the ylide's carbanion with a double bond.\n    *   Product structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\n3.  **Name the product:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain.\n    *   Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number results in the name: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n4.  **Determine the stereochemistry:**\n    *   Wittig reactions with unstabilized ylides reacting with aldehydes predominantly yield the (Z)-alkene (or cis-alkene), especially under salt-free conditions which are typical unless specified otherwise. This outcome is due to a kinetically controlled reaction pathway.\n    *   For the product 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, the Z-isomer has the higher priority groups on the same side of the double bond. The high-priority groups are the tert-butyl group `(-C(CH₃)₃)` and the `(-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄))` group.\n    *   Therefore, the major product formed is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
