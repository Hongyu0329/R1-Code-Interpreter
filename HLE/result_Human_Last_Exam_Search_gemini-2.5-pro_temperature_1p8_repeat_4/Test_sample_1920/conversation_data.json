    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d = 53599$.\n$53599 = 53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n$7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n$589 \\div 19 = 31$\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (it is square-free), a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the prime factors $p_i$ of $d$. The prime factors are $p_1=7$, $p_2=13$, $p_3=19$, and $p_4=31$.\n\n### 2. Primitive characters modulo a prime\nA character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial. The trivial character is the one that maps all integers not divisible by $p$ to 1, and it has order 1. Thus, for each $i$, the character $\\chi_i$ must have an order $o_i > 1$.\n\n### 3. Order of the composite character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n### 4. Conditions on the orders of component characters\nThe order $o_i$ of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide $\\phi(p_i)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n- For $p_1=7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n- For $p_2=13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n- For $p_3=19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$.\n- For $p_4=31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$ implies that each order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each character $\\chi_i$ must be primitive, its order must be greater than 1. Therefore, the possible orders for each component character $\\chi_i$ are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 5. Counting the number of characters for each valid order\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p)$. If $k$ divides $\\phi(p)$, the number of characters of order $k$ is given by $\\phi(k)$.\nFor all our primes $p_i$, $\\phi(p_i)$ is a multiple of 6. Thus, for each $p_i$, there exist characters of orders 2, 3, and 6.\n- Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n- Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n- Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four prime components, there are $1+2+2=5$ possible characters whose orders are in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 6. Combining the component characters\nWe need to form tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nLet's first count the total number of ways to choose one character for each prime factor, with its order being in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. For each of the 4 components, there are 5 such character choices. So, the total number of combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis total includes combinations where the lcm of the orders is not 6. Since all orders are divisors of 6, the lcm will also be a divisor of 6. The unwanted cases are those where the lcm is 2 or 3.\n\n- The lcm is 2 if and only if all orders $o_i$ are 2.\nFor each component, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So, there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ combination where the lcm is 2.\n\n- The lcm is 3 if and only if all orders $o_i$ are 3.\nFor each component, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ combinations where the lcm is 3.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d$ and order 6 is the total number of combinations minus the unwanted ones.\nNumber of characters = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with lcm=2) - (Combinations with lcm=3)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
