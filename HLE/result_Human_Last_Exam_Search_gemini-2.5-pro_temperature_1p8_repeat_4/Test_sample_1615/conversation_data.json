    "The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any such graph.\n\nLet $n = 12345$ be the number of vertices in graph $G$.\n\n1.  **Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$. A coloring can always be achieved by assigning a unique color to each vertex. So, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345$.\n\n2.  **Condition for $\\chi(G) = n$:** A graph $G$ with $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of $n$ if and only if it is the complete graph $K_n$. In a complete graph, every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each.\n\n3.  **Applying the Problem's Constraint:** The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$. Based on the principle above, this implies that its chromatic number must be strictly less than 12345. Therefore, we must have $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\n4.  **Achievability of the Maximum:** The final step is to determine if a chromatic number of 12344 is actually achievable for a graph that satisfies the given conditions. We can demonstrate this with a constructive example.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ formed by the disjoint union of two components:\n*   A complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$.\n*   A single, isolated vertex, $K_1$.\n\nThis graph $G$ has a total of $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. Since the graph is not connected, it is certainly not the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n\nThe chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n*   The chromatic number of the complete graph $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n*   The chromatic number of the isolated vertex $K_1$ is 1.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of our constructed graph $G$ is $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, and we have constructed a valid graph for which the chromatic number is exactly 12344, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
