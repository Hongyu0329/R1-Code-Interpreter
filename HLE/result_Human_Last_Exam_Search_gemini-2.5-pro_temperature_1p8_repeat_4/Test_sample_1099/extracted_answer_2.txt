To simulate the correlations from a set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state, the minimal resources required by a local hidden variable model are, on average, two bits of classical communication. Alternatively, for the more restricted case of projective measurements, one non-signaling PR-box is sufficient without communication. For the general case of POVMs, PR-boxes alone are insufficient.
