    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept in mathematics, specifically in the field of fixed-point theory. For three functions, F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, a triplet (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n\n*   x = F(x, y, z)\n*   y = G(y, x, y)\n*   z = H(z, y, x)\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under certain conditions on the metric spaces (X, d₁), (Y, d₂), and (Z, d₃), and on the functions F, G, and H themselves. These conditions are typically established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### Conditions on the Metric Spaces\n\n1.  **Completeness**: The metric spaces (X, d₁), (Y, d₂), and (Z, d₃) must be complete. This means that every Cauchy sequence of points in each space must converge to a point within that same space.\n2.  **Partial Order**: The sets X, Y, and Z are endowed with partial orders, denoted by ≼. A partially ordered set is a set equipped with a binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.\n\n### Conditions on the Functions\n\n1.  **Monotonicity**: The functions F, G, and H are required to have a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order. This property dictates how the functions behave when their arguments are ordered. For instance, F might be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n\n2.  **Continuity or Regularity**: The functions F, G, and H are either continuous or satisfy a regularity condition. If the functions are not continuous, an alternative condition is often imposed on the space, such as being regular. A partially ordered metric space is considered regular if for any non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} that converges to x, it follows that xₙ ≼ x for all n.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions F, G, and H must jointly satisfy a contractive condition. This is the most crucial condition, and it ensures that successive applications of the functions bring points closer together, eventually leading to a fixed point. A typical contractive condition takes the form:\n\n    d₁(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d₂(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d₃(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k [d₁(x, u) + d₂(y, v) + d₃(z, w)]\n\n    for all x, u in X, y, v in Y, and z, w in Z for which x ≽ u, y ≼ v, and z ≽ w. Here, k is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1. This condition essentially states that the mapping from (X × Y × Z, d) to itself, where d is the sum of the individual metrics, is a contraction mapping.\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial triple of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfies the following inequalities:\n\n    *   x₀ ≼ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ≽ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    *   z₀ ≼ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nThis initial point serves as the starting point for an iterative sequence that will converge to the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nUnder these conditions, it can be proven that there exists at least one FGH-tripled fixed point. To ensure the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition is typically required: for any two triples (x, y, z) and (x', y', z') in X × Y × Z, there exists a third triple (u, v, w) that is comparable to both.\n\nThe concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the tripled fixed point, where F=G=H, and an extension of the FG-coupled fixed point. These theoretical results have applications in various areas, including the study of the existence and uniqueness of solutions for systems of integral and differential equations.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is a triplet (x, y, z) such that x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x). The conditions for the existence of such a point are primarily established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve properties of the spaces and the functions.\n\n**Conditions on the spaces (X, Y, Z):**\n\n1.  **(Completeness):** The metric spaces (X, d₁), (Y, d₂), and (Z, d₃) must be complete.\n2.  **(Partial Order):** The sets X, Y, and Z are endowed with a partial order relation (denoted by ≼).\n\n**Conditions on the functions (F, G, H):**\n\n1.  **(Mixed Monotone Property):** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. For example, F may be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second with respect to the partial order.\n2.  **(Contractive Condition):** The functions must satisfy a contractive condition. A common form of this condition is:\n    d₁(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d₂(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d₃(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k [d₁(x, u) + d₂(y, v) + d₃(z, w)]\n    for all x ≽ u in X, y ≼ v in Y, and z ≽ w in Z, where 0 ≤ k < 1 is a constant. This essentially means the mapping defined by F, G, and H is a contraction on the product space.\n3.  **(Continuity or Regularity):** The functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous, or the partially ordered metric space must be regular (meaning for any non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} converging to x, we have xn ≼ x for all n).\n4.  **(Existence of an initial point):** There must exist an initial set of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z such that:\n    x₀ ≼ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    y₀ ≽ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    z₀ ≼ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nIf these conditions are met, then there exists an FGH-tripled fixed point. For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition is generally needed, which states that for any two points in the product space, there is a third point that is comparable to both. These concepts are extensions of tripled and coupled fixed point theorems and find applications in solving systems of integral and differential equations.>>>"
