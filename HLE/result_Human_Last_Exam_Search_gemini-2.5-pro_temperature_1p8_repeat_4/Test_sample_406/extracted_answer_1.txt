An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is a triplet (x, y, z) such that x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x). The conditions for the existence of such a point are primarily established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve properties of the spaces and the functions.

**Conditions on the spaces (X, Y, Z):**

1.  **(Completeness):** The metric spaces (X, d₁), (Y, d₂), and (Z, d₃) must be complete.
2.  **(Partial Order):** The sets X, Y, and Z are endowed with a partial order relation (denoted by ≼).

**Conditions on the functions (F, G, H):**

1.  **(Mixed Monotone Property):** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. For example, F may be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second with respect to the partial order.
2.  **(Contractive Condition):** The functions must satisfy a contractive condition. A common form of this condition is:
    d₁(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d₂(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d₃(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k [d₁(x, u) + d₂(y, v) + d₃(z, w)]
    for all x ≽ u in X, y ≼ v in Y, and z ≽ w in Z, where 0 ≤ k < 1 is a constant. This essentially means the mapping defined by F, G, and H is a contraction on the product space.
3.  **(Continuity or Regularity):** The functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous, or the partially ordered metric space must be regular (meaning for any non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} converging to x, we have xn ≼ x for all n).
4.  **(Existence of an initial point):** There must exist an initial set of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z such that:
    x₀ ≼ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)
    y₀ ≽ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)
    z₀ ≼ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)

If these conditions are met, then there exists an FGH-tripled fixed point. For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition is generally needed, which states that for any two points in the product space, there is a third point that is comparable to both. These concepts are extensions of tripled and coupled fixed point theorems and find applications in solving systems of integral and differential equations.
