    "The term \"power subgroup\" is not standard in group theory literature. It can be interpreted in a few ways, but the most likely meaning in this context is a **cyclic subgroup**, which is a subgroup generated by the powers of a single element. Based on this interpretation, we can calculate the number of such subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD₅₁₂, is a group of order 2⁹. It has the following presentation:\nSD₅₁₂ = < r, s | r²⁵⁶ = s² = 1, srs = r¹²⁷ >\n\nTo find the number of cyclic subgroups, we must find all the distinct subgroups generated by a single element of the group. We can categorize the elements of SD₅₁₂ into two types: those that are powers of `r`, and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups within <r>**:\n    The subgroup <r> is a cyclic group of order 256 (which is 2⁸). The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group is equal to the number of divisors of its order. The number of divisors of 2⁸ is 8 + 1 = 9. These subgroups are <r>, <r²>, <r⁴>, <r⁸>, <r¹⁶>, <r³²>, <r⁶⁴>, <r¹²⁸>, and the trivial subgroup {e}. These 9 subgroups have orders 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside <r>**:\n    The other 256 elements of the group have the form rⁱs for 0 ≤ i ≤ 255. We need to determine the orders of these elements to find the cyclic subgroups they generate. The square of such an element is (rⁱs)² = rⁱ(srⁱs) = rⁱ(r¹²⁷ⁱ) = r¹²⁸ⁱ.\n\n    *   **Elements of order 2**: If `i` is an even number (i = 2k), then (r²ᵏs)² = r¹²⁸(²ᵏ) = r²⁵⁶ᵏ = e. So, these elements have an order of 2. There are 128 even numbers for `i` between 0 and 255, giving 128 elements of order 2. Each of these elements generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2. This gives **128 subgroups of order 2**.\n\n    *   **Elements of order 4**: If `i` is an odd number (i = 2k+1), then (rⁱs)² = r¹²⁸ⁱ = r¹²⁸ (since i is odd). This means (rⁱs)⁴ = (r¹²⁸)² = r²⁵⁶ = e. Thus, these elements have an order of 4. There are 128 odd numbers for `i` between 0 and 255, resulting in 128 elements of order 4.\n        A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators. The two generators of the subgroup <rⁱs> are rⁱs and (rⁱs)³ = r¹²⁸(rⁱs) = r¹²⁸⁺ⁱs. Therefore, the elements rⁱs and r¹²⁸⁺ⁱs generate the same cyclic subgroup. Since there are 128 such elements of order 4, they form 128 / 2 = **64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4**.\n\nNow, we sum up the number of distinct cyclic subgroups:\n*   **Order 1**: 1 (the trivial subgroup)\n*   **Order 2**: 1 (from <r>, which is <r¹²⁸>) + 128 (from elements of the form r²ᵏs) = 129 subgroups.\n*   **Order 4**: 1 (from <r>, which is <r⁶⁴>) + 64 (from elements of the form r²ᵏ⁺¹s) = 65 subgroups.\n*   **Higher power-of-2 orders (8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256)**: These can only be found within the cyclic subgroup <r>. There is exactly one of each of these orders, making a total of 6 subgroups.\n\nThe total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of these counts:\n1 (order 1) + 129 (order 2) + 65 (order 4) + 6 (orders ≥ 8) = 201.\n\nA known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in a semidihedral group SD₂ⁿ is 3 * 2ⁿ⁻³ + n for n ≥ 4. For the semidihedral group of size 512, n = 9. Applying the formula:\n3 * 2⁹⁻³ + 9 = 3 * 2⁶ + 9 = 3 * 64 + 9 = 192 + 9 = 201.\nThis confirms the detailed calculation.\n\n<<<201>>>"
