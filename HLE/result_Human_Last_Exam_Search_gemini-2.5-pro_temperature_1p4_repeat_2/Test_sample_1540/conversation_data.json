    "To solve this problem with the most memory-efficient C program, we should avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously if possible. The standard input stream (`stdin`) is read sequentially. This means we must read the first string entirely before we can start reading the second one. Therefore, the most efficient approach is to store the first string in a buffer and then read the second string character by character, performing the comparison on the fly.\n\nThis method avoids allocating a buffer for the second string, saving approximately 101 bytes of memory compared to the straightforward approach of reading both strings into separate buffers.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient.\n *\n * Input:\n * The first line contains the first string.\n * The second line contains the second string.\n * Both strings have the same length, from 1 to 100 characters.\n *\n * Output:\n * -1 if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n *  1 if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n *  0 if the strings are equal.\n *\n * Memory-Efficiency Strategy:\n * To minimize memory usage, the program reads the first string into a buffer `s1`.\n * Then, it reads the second string one character at a time using getchar()\n * and compares it immediately with the corresponding character in `s1`.\n * This avoids the need to allocate a second buffer for the second string.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // Buffer for the first string.\n    // Maximum length is 100, plus 1 for the null terminator ('\\0').\n    // Memory: 101 * sizeof(char) = 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer by scanf.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Index for the first string. 'char' is sufficient as length <= 100.\n    // Memory: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // Variable to hold characters from the second string.\n    // Must be 'int' to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) value.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes (on typical systems).\n    int c2;\n\n    // Read the second string character by character until a newline or EOF is found.\n    while ((c2 = getchar()) != EOF && c2 != '\\n') {\n        // Convert both characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        char lower_s1 = tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]);\n        char lower_c2 = tolower((unsigned char)c2);\n\n        // If a difference is found, print the result and exit.\n        if (lower_s1 < lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (lower_s1 > lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        \n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this problem is the sum of the sizes of the variables declared within the `main` function:\n*   `char s1[101]`: 101 bytes\n*   `char i`: 1 byte\n*   `int c2`: 4 bytes (assuming a standard 32-bit or 64-bit architecture where an integer is 4 bytes)\n*   `char lower_s1`, `char lower_c2`: These are temporary variables within the loop's scope. They use 1 byte each. So, 2 bytes.\n\nTotal memory m = 101 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = **108 bytes**.\n\n*Correction*: A slightly more optimized version of the code would not store the result of `tolower` in separate variables, but this is a compiler optimization. Let's count the variables declared.\n\nLet's refine the count to only declared variables at the function scope:\n*   `char s1[101]`: 101 bytes\n*   `char i`: 1 byte\n*   `int c2`: 4 bytes\n\nTotal = 101 + 1 + 4 = 106. The variables `lower_s1` and `lower_c2` are scoped inside the loop and are an implementation detail that a compiler might optimize into registers. The fundamental variables needed are the buffer, the index, and the character variable.\n\nLet's stick with the most rigorous count including all declared variables.\n`m` = 101 (for `s1`) + 1 (for `i`) + 4 (for `c2`) + 1 (for `lower_s1`) + 1 (for `lower_c2`) = 108 bytes. Let's provide the leaner code and its associated memory which is 106.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    char s1[101]; // 101 bytes\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    getchar(); // Consume newline\n\n    char i = 0; // 1 byte\n    int c2;     // 4 bytes\n\n    while ((c2 = getchar()) != EOF && c2 != '\\n') {\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) != tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)c2) ? -1 : 1);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this version, the memory for declared variables is:\nm = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(c2)\nm = 101 + 1 + 4 = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
