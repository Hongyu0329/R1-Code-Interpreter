    "The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, are the Rhine, the Rhône, and the Po, which is identified with the mythical Eridanus. These rivers are all actual waterways in Europe, and their considerable lengths distinguish them from the other rivers, both real and mythical, that are referenced in the epic narrative.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Rhine River**, which flows for approximately 1,230 kilometers (about 765 miles). In the Aeneid, the Rhine is mentioned as a boundary of the Roman world. The Roman historian Tacitus, as well as the poet Virgil, acknowledged the Rhine as a significant river dividing Gaul and Germania.\n\nThe second longest is the **Rhône River**, with a length of 812 kilometers (about 505 miles). The Rhône, a major river in France and Switzerland, also figures in Virgil's depiction of the known world.\n\nThe third longest river is the **Po River**, which is often identified with the mythological **Eridanus River** mentioned in the Aeneid. The Po is Italy's longest river, stretching for 652 kilometers (about 405 miles). In the Aeneid, the Eridanus is described as a river in the underworld of Elysium.\n\nOther rivers are mentioned in the Aeneid, but are notably shorter or are purely mythological. The **Tiber River**, for instance, is central to the narrative as the site where Rome is destined to be founded, but it is shorter than the other three, with a length of about 406 kilometers (252 miles). The **Acheron River** is both a real river in Greece, measuring 52 kilometers, and a significant river in the epic's underworld. The remaining rivers of the underworld that appear in the Aeneid—the Styx, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Lethe—are mythological and thus do not have measurable lengths.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Rhine, the Rhône, and the Po (Eridanus).>>>"
