Let $f_m$ be the number of sets $T$ for given positive integers $n$ and $m$. The value of $f_m$ can be determined by the following recursive formula:
The base cases are:
*   $f_0 = 1$
*   $f_1 = 0$

For $m \ge 2$, the recursive step is:
$$ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right) $$
