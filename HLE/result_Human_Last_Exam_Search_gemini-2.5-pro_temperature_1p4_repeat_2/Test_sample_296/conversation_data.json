    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nAny subgroup of index 4 in a group G corresponds to a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_4, where the image of the homomorphism is a transitive subgroup of S_4. Since the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2), any of its homomorphic images must also be a 2-group. The transitive 2-subgroups of S_4 are the Klein four-group (V_4), which has order 4, and the dihedral group of order 8 (D_8).\n\nIt can be shown that the Grigorchuk group does not have any quotient group isomorphic to D_8. Therefore, any subgroup of index 4 must arise from a homomorphism to V_4.\n\nA homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group to the abelian group V_4 must factor through the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, i.e., (C_2)^3.\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 4 is therefore the number of surjective homomorphisms from (C_2)^3 to V_4 (which is isomorphic to (C_2)^2). In the language of vector spaces over the field with two elements, this is the number of surjective linear maps from a 3-dimensional space to a 2-dimensional space. The number of such maps is given by the formula for the number of 2-dimensional subspaces in a 3-dimensional space over the field with 2 elements, which is:\n\n(2^3 - 1)(2^3 - 2) / ((2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 2)) = (7 * 6) / (3 * 2) = 42 / 6 = 7.\n\nEach of these surjective homomorphisms has a distinct kernel of index 4. Thus, there are exactly 7 subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, and all of them are normal subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
