    "There are 46 true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the valid true expressions, categorized by their structure:\n\n### Expressions without Parentheses (30 expressions)\n\n1.  **Three Literals and Two Operators (`L op L op L`): 18 expressions**\n    *   Expressions with only `&`: `T&T&T` (1)\n    *   Expressions with only `|`: There are 7 true combinations (`T|T|T`, `T|T|F`, `T|F|T`, `F|T|T`, `T|F|F`, `F|T|F`, `F|F|T`).\n    *   Mixed operators (`A&B|C` or `A|B&C`): Due to `&` having higher precedence, these are parsed as `(A&B)|C` and `A|(B&C)`. Each structure results in 5 true combinations. (10 total)\n\n2.  **Triple Negation (`!!!L op L` or `L op !!!L`): 8 expressions**\n    *   `!!!A|B`: 3 expressions (`!!!T|T`, `!!!F|T`, `!!!F|F`)\n    *   `A|!!!B`: 3 expressions (`T|!!!T`, `T|!!!F`, `F|!!!F`)\n    *   `!!!A&B`: 1 expression (`!!!F&T`)\n    *   `A&!!!B`: 1 expression (`T&!!!F`)\n\n3.  **Double Single Negation (`!L op !L`): 4 expressions**\n    *   `!A|!B`: 3 expressions (`!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`)\n    *   `!A&!B`: 1 expression (`!F&!F`)\n\n### Expressions with Parentheses (16 expressions)\n\n1.  **Expressions of the form `(A)` where A has length 3: 6 expressions**\n    *   `(L op L)`: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` (4)\n    *   `(!!L)`: `(!!T)` (1)\n    *   `((L))`: `((T))` (1)\n\n2.  **Expressions of the form `!(A)` where A has length 3: 6 expressions**\n    *   `!(L&L)`: `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)` (3)\n    *   `!(L|L)`: `!(F|F)` (1)\n    *   `!(!!L)`: `!(!!F)` (1)\n    *   `!((L))`: `!((F))` (1)\n\n3.  **Expressions of the form `!!(A)` where A has length 1: 1 expression**\n    *   `!!(T)` (1)\n\n4.  **Expressions where parentheses change the order of operations: 3 expressions**\n    *   `(L|L)&L`: `(T|T)&T`, `(T|F)&T`, `(F|T)&T` (3)\n\nAdding all these cases together: 30 + 16 = 46.\n\n<<<46>>>"
