    "A standard chessboard has 64 squares in an 8x8 grid. The edge squares are those that form the perimeter of the board. The number of edge squares on a standard 8x8 board is 28. This can be calculated by summing the squares on the top and bottom rows (8 + 8 = 16) and adding the squares on the far-left and far-right columns, excluding the corners already counted (6 + 6 = 12), for a total of 28.\n\nThe problem states that the aim of the game was to place as many bishops as possible on these edge squares. In chess problems, \"as many as possible\" implies placing the maximum number of non-attacking pieces. Bishops attack along diagonals of the same color. To find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, we can analyze the light and dark squares separately.\n\nThere are 14 light-colored and 14 dark-colored squares on the perimeter. For the 14 light squares, many of them lie on the same diagonals. For instance, the squares a2 and b1 are on the same diagonal, as are a4 and d1, a6 and f1, a8 and h1, and so on. Due to these attacking lines, you can only place one bishop on each of these shared diagonals. A detailed analysis shows that the 14 light squares are on 7 distinct diagonals. Therefore, a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed on the light-colored edge squares.\n\nSimilarly, the 14 dark-colored edge squares also fall along 7 distinct diagonals (e.g., a1 and h8, b8 and h2). This also allows for a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops on the dark squares.\n\nCombining both colors, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a chessboard is 7 (from the light squares) + 7 (from the dark squares), which equals 14 bishops. The problem on a full 8x8 board confirms that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops is 14.\n\nWith 28 total edge squares and having successfully placed the maximum possible number of 14 non-attacking bishops, the number of edge squares without a bishop is the difference:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (maximum bishops) = 14 squares.\n\n<<<14>>>"
