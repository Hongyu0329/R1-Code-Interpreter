    "### Deriving Equilibrium Properties of Photon Gas using Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) can be determined using the principles of large deviation theory (LDT). This approach provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for statistical mechanics, where equilibrium states are seen as the most probable outcomes, and non-equilibrium states are viewed as \"large deviations\" from this norm. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems are central to this framework.\n\n#### Conceptual Framework: LDT in Statistical Mechanics\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the macroscopic properties of a system emerge from the collective behavior of its microscopic constituents. For a photon gas, the microstate is defined by the number of photons occupying each possible energy level. The macrostate is defined by the overall distribution of photons across these energy levels.\n\nLarge deviation theory formalizes the idea that for a large number of particles, the system is overwhelmingly likely to be found in the macrostate that corresponds to the greatest number of microstates. Any other macrostate is an exponentially rare event, a \"large deviation.\" The probability of observing such a rare event is quantified by a \"rate function,\" which, in the context of statistical mechanics, is directly related to entropy.\n\n#### Application of the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem to Find the Equilibrium Distribution and Entropy\n\n1.  **Empirical Distribution**: Consider a system of *N* photons distributed among discrete energy levels {ε₀, ε₁, ε₂, ...}. We can describe the macroscopic state of the system by the fraction of photons *pᵢ* that occupy the *i*-th energy level. The set of these fractions, {*pᵢ*}, represents the empirical distribution of photons over the energy states.\n\n2.  **Sanov's Theorem and Entropy**: The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem states that the probability of an empirical distribution {*pᵢ*} deviating from a true underlying distribution {*qᵢ*} is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy.\n\n    In the context of a Bose gas, we consider the distribution of *N* indistinguishable particles into states. The probability *P*({*pᵢ*}) of observing a specific distribution {*pᵢ*} is related to the number of ways (multiplicity) that distribution can be realized. For bosons, the rate function *I*({*pᵢ*}), which governs this probability, is equivalent to the negative of the system's entropy, *S*.\n    *P*({*pᵢ*}) ≈ exp(-*N* *I*({*pᵢ*})) = exp(*S*/k​B​)\n\n    The equilibrium state is the most probable distribution, which corresponds to minimizing the rate function *I* or, equivalently, maximizing the entropy *S*.\n\n3.  **Maximizing Entropy**: The entropy for a Bose gas, in terms of the average occupation number *nᵢ* of state *i* (with degeneracy *gᵢ*), is given by:\n    *S* = k​B​ ∑ᵢ [*gᵢ* ( (1+*nᵢ*)ln(1+*nᵢ*) - *nᵢ*ln(*nᵢ*) )]\n\n    To find the equilibrium distribution, we maximize this entropy subject to two constraints:\n    a. The total number of particles is *N* (Σ *nᵢ* *gᵢ* = *N*).\n    b. The total energy is *U* (Σ *nᵢ* *gᵢ* εᵢ = *U*).\n\n    For a photon gas, the number of photons is not conserved because they can be emitted and absorbed by the walls of their container. Therefore, only the total energy constraint applies. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize *S* with a fixed total energy *U*, we find the equilibrium occupation number *n*(ε), which is the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (with chemical potential µ=0):\n\n    **n(ε) = 1 / (exp(βε) - 1)**\n\n    where β = 1/(k​B​T) is the Lagrange multiplier related to the inverse temperature.\n\n#### Application of the Cramér-Chernoff Theorem to the Mean Energy\n\n1.  **Energy as a Sum of Random Variables**: The total energy *U* of the photon gas is the sum of the energies of all individual photons: *U* = Σ *Nᵢ* εᵢ. The Cramér-Chernoff theorem provides the probability of the sample mean of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables deviating from the true mean. In this context, it can be applied to understand the fluctuations in the total energy.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy**: The equilibrium value of the mean energy is found by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by the number of photons in that state, governed by the Bose-Einstein distribution. To do this, we must also consider the density of states *g(ε)*, which for photons in a 3D cavity of volume *V* is:\n    *g(ε)dε* = (8π*V* / (h³c³)) *ε² dε*\n\n    The mean energy *U* is then the integral of energy multiplied by the number of states and the occupation number per state:\n    *U* = ∫₀^∞ ε *n(ε)* *g(ε)* dε\n\n    Substituting the expressions for *n(ε)* and *g(ε)* gives:\n    *U* = (8π*V* / (h³c³)) ∫₀^∞ (ε³ / (exp(βε) - 1)) dε\n\n3.  **Final Value of Mean Energy**: Solving this integral leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of a photon gas:\n\n    **U = (8π⁵k​B​⁴ / (15h³c³)) *V*T⁴**\n\n    This is the equilibrium mean energy for a gas of photons.\n\n#### Equilibrium Value of Entropy\n\nWith the equilibrium distribution and mean energy determined, we can now find the equilibrium value of the entropy. By substituting the Bose-Einstein distribution back into the entropy formula and performing the integration over all energy states, we obtain:\n\n**S = (32π⁵k​B​⁴ / (45h³c³)) *V*T³**\n\nThis result can also be expressed in terms of the mean energy *U*:\n\n**S = (4/3) * U/T**\n\nIn conclusion, applying the large deviation theorems of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff allows for the derivation of the fundamental equilibrium properties of a photon gas. The equilibrium state is the Bose-Einstein distribution, which maximizes the system's entropy. From this distribution, the well-known expressions for the mean energy (Stefan-Boltzmann law) and the thermodynamic entropy of blackbody radiation are recovered.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\nU = (8π⁵k​B​⁴ / (15h³c³)) *V*T⁴\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nS = (32π⁵k​B​⁴ / (45h³c³)) *V*T³\n>>>"
