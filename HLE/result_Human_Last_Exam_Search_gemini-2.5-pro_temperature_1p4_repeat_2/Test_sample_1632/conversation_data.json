    "### The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not intersect itself. The Manhattan lattice is equivalent to the square lattice in this context. While there is no simple formula to calculate the number of self-avoiding walks of a given length, these values have been computed and tabulated.\n\nFor an n-step self-avoiding walk, let a(n) be the number of possible walks. The values for small n are well-established:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284.\n\nFor a 10-step walk, the computed value is 44,100. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences under the identifier A001411.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
