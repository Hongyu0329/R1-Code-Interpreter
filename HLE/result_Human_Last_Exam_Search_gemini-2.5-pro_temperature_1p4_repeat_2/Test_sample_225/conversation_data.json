    "The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt) can be determined by a known formula when 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers. In this case, a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFirst, it is important to confirm that the greatest common divisor of 'a' and 'b' is 1. The numbers 9 and 5 are indeed coprime.\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points of such a Lissajous curve is given by:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nSubstituting the given values of a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula, we get:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nTherefore, the curve consisting of all points (cos(9t), sin(5t)) has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
