For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\phi$ of squarefree level $N$, a significant hybrid upper bound for its maximum norm $\| \phi \|_\infty$ in terms of its Laplace eigenvalue $\lambda$ and the covolume $V$ is given by $\|\phi\|_\infty \ll_{\epsilon} \lambda^{5/24 + \epsilon} V^{1/3 + \epsilon}$.
