    "When considering an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $\\phi$ for a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number, the upper bound for its maximum norm, often denoted as $\\| \\phi \\|_\\infty$, is studied in what is known as the sup-norm problem. This problem seeks to bound the \"peak\" value of the form in terms of its intrinsic parameters: the Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the level $N$, which is directly related to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding quotient space.\n\nThe notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ in the query is interpreted as the sup-norm $\\| \\phi \\|_\\infty$. For a squarefree level $N$, the covolume $V$ of the space $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ is approximately proportional to $N$. Specifically, $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N}(1 + \\frac{1}{p})$, where the product term has a slow logarithmic growth. Therefore, bounds in terms of $N$ are roughly equivalent to bounds in terms of $V$, with the same exponent up to an arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$.\n\nA key result in this area, which provides a \"hybrid\" bound that is uniform in both the eigenvalue and the level, was established for squarefree levels. For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ with Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and squarefree level $N$, a significant upper bound is given by:\n\n$\\| \\phi \\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon} N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$\n\nGiven the relationship between the covolume $V$ and the level $N$, this bound can be expressed in terms of the covolume as:\n\n$\\| \\phi \\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon} V^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$\n\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$. This result was a notable improvement over the \"trivial\" local bound of $\\lambda^{1/4}N^{1/2}$ and represents a fundamental result in the analytic theory of automorphic forms.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in the level aspect alone (where the dependency on $\\lambda$ is treated as fixed), even stronger bounds have been achieved. For instance, it has been shown that for any Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform of square-free level $N$:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon} \\|f\\|_2$\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized form, this implies the sup-norm can decrease as the level (and thus covolume) increases.\n\nThe research on the sup-norm problem is an active area, with ongoing efforts to improve these exponents and generalize the results to non-squarefree levels and other settings. The works of Blomer, Harcos, Maga, Milićević, and Templier have been pivotal in establishing these bounds.\n\n<<<For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ of squarefree level $N$, a significant hybrid upper bound for its maximum norm $\\| \\phi \\|_\\infty$ in terms of its Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the covolume $V$ is given by $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon} V^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$.>>>"
