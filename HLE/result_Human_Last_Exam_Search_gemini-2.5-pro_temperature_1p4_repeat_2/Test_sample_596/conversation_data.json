    "There is exactly one such higher-dimensional rooted forest.\n\nA \"higher dimensional forest\" `(F,R)` of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band fails to simplicially collapse onto its root `R` if the forest `F` is not collapsible to `R`. This failure to collapse arises from a topological obstruction. For a subcomplex of the Möbius band, the primary obstruction to collapsing to a point (and therefore to a root contained within it) is the presence of a non-trivial cycle in its fundamental group. The Möbius band's fundamental group is isomorphic to the group of integers, **Z**, which is generated by the central loop of the band.\n\nA subcomplex of the triangulated Möbius band will fail to be collapsible if it is homotopy equivalent to the Möbius band itself, which means it must contain a representation of this central, non-trivial loop.\n\nThe term \"forest\" in a higher-dimensional combinatorial context typically refers to a subcomplex that is acyclic in some sense (usually homologically). However, the question asks for the number of such forests that *fail* to collapse, which implies they are not acyclic in the sense of being contractible. This suggests we are looking for minimal non-collapsible subcomplexes.\n\nIn any triangulation of the Möbius band, there exists a unique minimal non-contractible cycle of triangles that represents the generator of the fundamental group. This structure is the fundamental topological obstruction. If we consider a \"higher dimensional forest\" in this context to be such a minimal non-collapsible subcomplex, then there is only one such fundamental structure within the standard triangulation. This minimal non-collapsible subcomplex, when paired with a root (for example, one of its vertices), constitutes the unique higher-dimensional rooted forest that fails to collapse.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1, representing the single fundamental topological obstruction to collapsibility within the Möbius band.\n\n<<<1>>>"
