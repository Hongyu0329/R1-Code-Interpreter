    "The most common and efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gases. This direct synthesis is typically carried out in a nickel container at a temperature of approximately 400°C. The reaction is exothermic, releasing 251 kJ/mol.\n\nThe process involves reacting xenon and fluorine, usually in a 1:5 molar ratio, at 6 atmospheres of pressure to yield XeF4. While a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C can be used, 400°C is the most frequently cited optimal temperature for an efficient reaction. Other synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge at very low temperatures (-80°C to 0°C), but this method is noted for having low productivity and resulting in a mixture of different xenon fluorides, making it inefficient for producing pure XeF4. Another method involves initiating a combustion reaction with a pulse of heat at 650-700°C, with the reactor walls then heated to 70-80°C. However, the standard thermal synthesis remains the benchmark for efficient production.\n\nTherefore, the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can still be produced efficiently through its most common synthesis method is 400°C.\n\n<<<B>>>"
