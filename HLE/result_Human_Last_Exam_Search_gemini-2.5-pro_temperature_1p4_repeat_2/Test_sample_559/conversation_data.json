    "The analysis of the provided system of differential equations reveals that the concept of a separatrix is central to understanding its dynamics. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. These are typically associated with the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points of the system by setting both derivatives, $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$, to zero.\n\nThe equation $u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t) = 0$ yields solutions at $u = 0$ and $u = 1$.\n\n*   For $u = 0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d = 0$. Thus, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   For $u = 1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, which has solutions $d = 0$ and $d = -1$. This gives two more equilibrium points: $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of these points by linearizing the system and examining the Jacobian matrix at each point.\n\n*   The point $(0, 1)$ is found to be an unstable node (a source), meaning trajectories move away from it.\n*   The point $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point, which is crucial for finding the separatrix. A saddle point has associated stable and unstable manifolds that act as separatrices.\n*   The point $(0, 0)$ is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point, and its stability analysis is more complex.\n\nA key step is to search for invariant manifolds, which are curves that are themselves trajectories of the system. By testing a simple polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$, we can verify that the parabola given by the equation **$d = -u^2$** is an exact solution curve for the system.\n\nTo confirm this, we can substitute $d = -u^2$ into the first differential equation:\nThe left-hand side becomes:\n$d'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u'(t) = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nThe right-hand side becomes:\n$2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince both sides are equal, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold.\n\nThis curve passes through the equilibrium points $(-1, 1)$ and $(0, 0)$. Furthermore, by analyzing the tangent of this curve at the saddle point $(-1, 1)$, it can be shown that it aligns with the direction of the unstable manifold of this point. The unstable manifold of a saddle point, which consists of trajectories leaving the point, is a separatrix.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point at $(-1, 1)$ and acts as a separatrix for the system in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$). It divides the phase plane into regions with qualitatively distinct dynamics.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
