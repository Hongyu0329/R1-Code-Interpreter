    "There are exactly 14 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. This classification was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2009 paper, \"Small maximal sum-free sets\".\n\nA product-free set within a group G is a subset S where the product of any two elements in S (including the square of an element) is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G.\n\nThe 14 finite groups are:\n\n**Abelian Groups (8 groups):**\n*   The Klein four-group, C₂ × C₂.\n*   Cyclic group of order 5, C₅.\n*   Cyclic group of order 6, C₆.\n*   Cyclic group of order 7, C₇.\n*   Cyclic group of order 8, C₈.\n*   Cyclic group of order 9, C₉.\n*   Cyclic group of order 10, C₁₀.\n*   Cyclic group of order 12, C₁₂.\n\n**Non-Abelian Groups (6 groups):**\n*   Dihedral group of order 6, D₆ (also known as the symmetric group S₃).\n*   Dihedral group of order 8, D₈.\n*   Dihedral group of order 10, D₁₀.\n*   Dihedral group of order 12, D₁₂.\n*   Quaternion group of order 8, Q₈.\n*   Dicyclic group of order 12, Q₁₂ (sometimes referred to as the generalized quaternion group Q₁₂).\n\nThe classification is exhaustive and considers all cases, including whether the product-free set of size 2 generates the entire group or a proper normal subgroup.\n\n<<<14>>>"
