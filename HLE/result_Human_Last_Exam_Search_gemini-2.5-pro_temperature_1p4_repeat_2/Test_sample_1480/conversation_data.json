    "In a fuzzy inference system, the rule activation level, also known as the firing strength, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the membership values of the antecedents of a rule. In this specific case, the firing strength of the k-th rule's antecedent is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership value of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nThe activation level of the rule is the result of the t-norm operation between the firing strength of the antecedent (`Phi_k(x′)`) and the membership of the consequent (`μG_k_j(y_j)`). A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. Common t-norms include the minimum and the product.\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not provided, the most common one, the minimum t-norm, is typically used. The calculation is as follows:\n\n*   **Using the minimum t-norm:**\n    Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\n    Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\nAlternatively, if the product t-norm were to be used:\n\n*   **Using the product t-norm:**\n    Activation Level = Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)\n    Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nAlthough the problem mentions an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the inputs provided are crisp numbers. This suggests the calculation is for a specific point or a defuzzified value within the more complex type-3 structure. Based on standard fuzzy logic principles, the rule activation level is calculated by combining the antecedent firing strength with the consequent membership value using a t-norm. Assuming the most common t-norm (minimum) is implied, the activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
