    "An interacting scalar field theory, most commonly represented by a φ⁴ interaction, involves vertices where four field lines meet. The number of loops in a connected Feynman diagram is determined by the formula L = I - V + 1, where L is the number of loops, I is the number of internal propagators (lines), and V is the number of vertices.\n\nFor a two-loop diagram (L=2), this equation becomes 2 = I - V + 1, which simplifies to I = V + 1.\n\nThe relationship between the number of vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E) for a φ⁴ theory is given by the equation 4V = 2I + E, as each vertex has four lines, and each internal line connects two vertices while each external line connects to one.\n\nTo find the minimum number of vertices, we can consider diagrams with the fewest possible external lines. A vacuum polarization diagram, for instance, has no external lines (E=0). In this case, the relation becomes 4V = 2I.\n\nSubstituting I = V + 1 into this equation gives:\n4V = 2(V + 1)\n4V = 2V + 2\n2V = 2\nV = 1\n\nThis result indicates that a two-loop diagram with a single vertex is possible. Let's verify this. If V=1, then I = 1 + 1 = 2. Plugging this into the loop formula gives L = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2. This corresponds to a \"figure-eight\" vacuum bubble diagram, which is a valid two-loop diagram. Since a diagram must have at least one vertex, this is the minimum possible number.\n\nAnother common two-loop diagram is the \"sunset\" diagram, which is a correction to the propagator and has two external lines (E=2). For this diagram:\n4V = 2I + 2\nI = 2V - 1\nSubstituting this into the loop formula for L=2:\n2 = (2V - 1) - V + 1\n2 = V\nSo, the sunset diagram has two vertices.\n\nSince a two-loop diagram with one vertex exists, the minimum number of vertices required is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
