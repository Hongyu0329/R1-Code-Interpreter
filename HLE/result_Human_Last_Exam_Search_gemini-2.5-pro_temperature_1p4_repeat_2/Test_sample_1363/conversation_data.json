    "In the Slow Foxtrot, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the dance's technique.\n\nThe technique of the reverse turn in the Slow Foxtrot requires the follower to execute a heel turn. Following this, the follower must step straight forward between the leader's legs. If the follower were to overturn the heel turn, it would be technically incorrect and prevent them from taking the next step as required, which is a fundamental part of the figure's technique.\n\nWhile overturning a reverse turn in a Viennese Waltz is considered very difficult, particularly around corners, and is generally avoided in favor of a natural turn, it is not deemed technically impossible. In fact, some sources suggest a slight overturn is necessary to navigate the corners of the dance floor. For the other dances listed:\n\n*   **English Waltz:** Variations like the \"Overturned Running Spin Turn\" exist, indicating that overturning is possible within specific figures.\n*   **European Tango:** The technical descriptions of the reverse turn do not suggest that overturning is impossible.\n*   **Quickstep:** Overturning is a known variation used in certain figure combinations, such as the \"overturned Progressive Chass√©\".\n\nTherefore, the Slow Foxtrot is the dance in which overturning a reverse turn inherently violates the established technique.\n\n<<<D>>>"
