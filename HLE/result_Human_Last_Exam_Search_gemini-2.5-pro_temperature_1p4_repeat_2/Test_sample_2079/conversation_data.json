    "While the exact name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461 is not readily available in the provided search results, historical context suggests that the town was governed by a judge (iudex) and a town council, who were elected annually.\n\nSeveral sources point to the comprehensive work by Mária Fedorčáková, \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" (The Administration of the Town of Bardejov in the Middle Ages (1320–1526)), as containing detailed lists of the town's officials, including judges. A review of this book confirms that its appendices include lists of judges and members of the town council up to the 1520s. This publication is the most likely source for identifying the specific individual who held the position of judge in 1461.\n\nDuring the 15th century, Bártfa was a significant free royal town with a well-developed administration. The town council and the judge were responsible for the town's legal and administrative affairs. The position of judge was an elected one, and the outer council, comprised of elders, was responsible for this annual election.\n\nA notable figure in Bardejov's history, Valentinus Eck (Ecchius), is mentioned as having served as a schoolmaster and later as the city's judge. However, the precise years he held the judicial office are not specified in the available resources and it is unclear if his tenure as judge aligns with the year 1461.\n\nTo definitively ascertain the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461, one would need to consult the appendices of Mária Fedorčáková's aforementioned book or other specific archival records from the town of Bardejov for that year.\n\n<<<Based on the available information, the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided search results. The most likely source to contain this information is the book \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by Mária Fedorčáková, which includes a list of judges from that period. Without direct access to this book's appendices, the specific name of the judge for the year 1461 cannot be provided at this time.>>>"
