    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Determine the value of S**\n\nThe variable *S* is defined as SNYWR, which stands for the \"Sum of the Numbers in the Year of Your Response.\" The current year is 2025, so:\n*S* = 2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9.\nTherefore, the length of side BC is 9.\n\n**2. Understand the condition for two possible triangles**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of integer values of side AC for which there are two possible values for side AB. We are given two sides (BC and AC) and a non-included angle (∠B), which is the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case. This scenario is known as the ambiguous case in trigonometry.\n\nFor an acute angle B (which 30° is), two distinct triangles can be formed if and only if the side opposite the angle (AC) is longer than the triangle's altitude from vertex C, but shorter than the other given side (BC).\n\n**3. Calculate the altitude**\n\nLet *h* be the altitude from vertex C to the line containing side AB. The formula for this altitude is:\n*h* = BC * sin(B)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n*h* = 9 * sin(30°)\nSince sin(30°) = 0.5,\n*h* = 9 * 0.5 = 4.5\n\n**4. Establish the inequality for AC**\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles is:\n*h* < AC < BC\n\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n4.5 < AC < 9\n\n**5. Find the number of integer values for AC**\n\nWe need to find the number of integers that AC can be, according to the inequality `4.5 < AC < 9`. The integers that satisfy this condition are:\n5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nCounting these values, we find there are 4 possible integer values for AC.\n\n<<<4>>>"
