    "To find the solution to the equation, the Roman numerals must first be converted into modern Arabic numbers.\n\nFirst, let's identify the value of each Roman numeral in the equation:\n*   **VIII** is 8.\n*   **CCC** is 300.\n*   **MMDCCLXXXVII** is 2787.\n\nWith these values, the equation can be rewritten using modern numbers as:\n8 / 300 - 2787\n\nFollowing the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), the division is performed before the subtraction.\n\n1.  **Divide 8 by 300:**\n    8 ÷ 300 = 0.02666... (the 6 is a repeating decimal)\n\n2.  **Subtract 2787 from the result:**\n    0.02666... - 2787 = -2786.97333...\n\nThe exact answer as a fraction is -209023/75. In decimal form, the solution is a repeating decimal.\n\nThe solution to the equation is approximately -2786.973.\n\n<<<-2786.9733333333>>>"
