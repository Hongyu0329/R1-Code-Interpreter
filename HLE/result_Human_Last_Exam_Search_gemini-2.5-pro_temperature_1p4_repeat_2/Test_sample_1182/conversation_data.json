    "The number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers is 1.\n\nThe reasoning is based on the analysis of the stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves, which relates the structure of the reduction to the 2-adic properties of the roots of the defining polynomial. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Genus of the Curve**: The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, since it is defined by an equation of the form $y^2 = f(x)$ where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5.\n\n2.  **Branch Points and their Valuations**: The behavior of the curve's reduction is determined by the branch points, which are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x$ and the point at infinity. The polynomial can be factored as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\n    *   One root is $r_1 = 0$.\n    *   By analyzing the Newton polygon of the quartic factor, one can determine the 2-adic valuations of the other four roots. It turns out there is one root, $r_2$, with a 2-adic valuation $v_2(r_2) = 3$, and three roots, $r_3, r_4, r_5$, each with a 2-adic valuation of -1.\n\n3.  **Clustering of Branch Points**: The branch points of the curve partition into clusters based on their 2-adic distances. In this case, the valuations strongly suggest a partition into two clusters:\n    *   **Cluster 1 ($S_1$)**: This cluster contains the roots with large positive valuations and the point at infinity. This includes the roots $r_1=0$, $r_2$, and the point at infinity, making a total of 3 branch points.\n    *   **Cluster 2 ($S_2$)**: This cluster contains the roots with negative valuation, which are $r_3, r_4, r_5$, totaling 3 branch points.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Stable Reduction**: The stable reduction of the curve consists of several irreducible components connected at double points (nodes). The number of components and their genera are determined by the root clusters.\n    *   The number of components in the stable reduction corresponds to the number of clusters, which is 2.\n    *   The genus of each component is determined by the number of branch points in the corresponding cluster. For a cluster $S_i$, the genus of the component $C_i$ is $g_i = \\lfloor (\\#S_i - 1)/2 \\rfloor$.\n    *   For the first component $C_1$, corresponding to $S_1$, the genus is $g_1 = \\lfloor (3-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. This component is an elliptic curve.\n    *   For the second component $C_2$, corresponding to $S_2$, the genus is $g_2 = \\lfloor (3-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. This component is also an elliptic curve.\n\n5.  **Number of Double Points**: The total genus of a stable curve is related to the genera of its components and the number of double points ($\\delta$) by the formula: $g = \\sum g_i + \\delta - N + 1$, where $N$ is the number of components.\n    *   Substituting the known values: $2 = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 2 + 1$.\n    *   $2 = 1 + 1 + \\delta - 1$.\n    *   This implies $\\delta = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve consists of two elliptic curves intersecting at a single double point.\n\n<<<1>>>"
