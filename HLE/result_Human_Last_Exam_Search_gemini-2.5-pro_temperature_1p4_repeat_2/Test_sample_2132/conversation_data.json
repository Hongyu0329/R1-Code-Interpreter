    "### Product of Favorskii Rearrangement Identified as Ethyl Cyclopentanecarboxylate\n\nThe Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, when conducted using a base such as sodium ethoxide, results in the formation of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. This reaction is a characteristic example of a ring contraction in cyclic α-halo ketones.\n\nThe mechanism involves the initial deprotonation at the α'-carbon to form an enolate. This intermediate then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, creating a cyclopropanone intermediate. The cyclopropanone is subsequently attacked by the alkoxide nucleophile (ethoxide in this case), leading to the opening of the three-membered ring to form a more stable carbanion, which ultimately yields the final ester product, ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\n### Böttcher Molecular Complexity: A Measure of Structural Information\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity (C_m) is a quantitative index that assesses the complexity of a molecule based on information theory. It is calculated by summing the information content of the chemical microenvironment of every atom within the molecule.\n\nSeveral key molecular features are factored into the calculation:\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The presence of chiral centers is considered.\n*   **Bonding:** Unsaturated bonds contribute to the complexity score.\n*   **Branching and Connectivity:** The degree of branching and the connectivity of atoms are analyzed.\n*   **Symmetry:** Molecular symmetry is taken into account.\n*   **Heteroatoms:** The diversity of elements other than carbon and hydrogen is included.\n\nDue to the intricate nature of the calculation, which requires specialized software or web-based tools that analyze each atom's unique microenvironment, a numerical Böttcher complexity score for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate cannot be manually calculated here.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a numerical answer for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity as it requires specialized computational tools. The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.>>>"
