    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ transforms a qudit density matrix, an operator on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$, into another density matrix. Its general form is given by:\n\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\rho$ is the input qudit density matrix.\n*   $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is the set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n*   $\\{p_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel $\\Lambda$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that is \"leaked\" to the environment during the quantum evolution. A key property is that the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the number of linearly independent Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$. This is also known as the Choi rank of the channel.\n\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of $\\Lambda$, we need to find the maximum possible number of linearly independent Kraus operators $A_k$. The set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ is linearly independent because it forms a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nThe linear independence of the Kraus operators $\\{A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k\\}$ therefore depends on the coefficients $\\sqrt{p_k}$. The set $\\{A_k\\}$ will be linearly independent if and only if the coefficients $\\sqrt{p_k}$ are non-zero for linearly independent $U_k$. To maximize the number of linearly independent Kraus operators, we can choose a Pauli channel where all the probabilities $p_k$ are strictly greater than zero.\n\nFor instance, we can consider the qudit depolarizing channel, a specific type of Pauli channel where $p_k = \\frac{1}{d^2}$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. In this case, all $d^2$ Kraus operators $A_k = \\frac{1}{d} U_k$ are non-zero multiples of the linearly independent Pauli operators. Consequently, the set of these $d^2$ Kraus operators is linearly independent.\n\nSince there are $d^2$ linearly independent Kraus operators, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$. The maximum number of linearly independent operators in the space of $d \\times d$ matrices is $d^2$, which means the rank cannot exceed this value.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a qudit of dimension $d$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
