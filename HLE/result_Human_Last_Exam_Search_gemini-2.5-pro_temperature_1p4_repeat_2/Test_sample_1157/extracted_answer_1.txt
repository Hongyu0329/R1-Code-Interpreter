The appropriate management involves a phased approach starting with medical consultation to control her diabetes, followed by management of the sockets of the lost teeth. The teeth cannot be replanted due to the 28-hour delay. Definitive treatment would ideally be a cast metal framework removable partial denture, using the left central incisor and left second premolar as abutment teeth. The key cells involved are those responsible for socket healing (platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, Gli1+ cells) and those in the periodontal ligament of the abutment teeth that withstand the prosthetic forces (fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, cementoblasts).
