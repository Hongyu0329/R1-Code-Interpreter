Based on the provided XRD data, it is not possible to definitively determine the chemical phase, unit cell structure, and lattice constants. The pattern exhibits multiple strong peaks that do not correspond to a single, common inorganic compound from the initial database searches. The peak at approximately 33.0° suggests the presence of Cerium Oxide (CeO2), which has a face-centered cubic structure. However, the most intense peaks at roughly 36.0° and 39.2° belong to another phase or phases. Therefore, the material is likely a composite or a mixture of different chemical phases. For a conclusive analysis, further investigation using a comprehensive powder diffraction database and refinement software is required.
