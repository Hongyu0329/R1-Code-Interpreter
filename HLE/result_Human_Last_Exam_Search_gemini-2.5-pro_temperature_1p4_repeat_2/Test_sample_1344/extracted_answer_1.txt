A single-site catalyst system composed of a Zirconium (Zr) or Hafnium (Hf) metal center, stabilized by robust bidentate ligands such as phosphanylphenoxides, and supported on sulfated alumina (AlS). This combination creates a highly electrophilic cationic active site capable of both olefin polymerization in the presence of monomers and polyolefin hydrogenolysis to short alkanes when exposed to a polymer feedstock and hydrogen gas.
