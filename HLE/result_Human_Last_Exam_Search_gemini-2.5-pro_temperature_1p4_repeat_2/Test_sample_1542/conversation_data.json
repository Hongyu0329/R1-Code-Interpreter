    "The number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R = Z/8Z is 26. A quadratic form in two variables over this ring is a polynomial `Q(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy²`, where the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are elements of Z/8Z. Two such forms are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear transformation of the variables `x` and `y` with coefficients in Z/8Z.\n\nThe classification of these quadratic forms is a non-trivial problem in number theory. The total number of classes can be determined by stratifying the forms based on the ideal generated by their coefficients. This method involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Stratification by Ideals**: The set of all quadratic forms is partitioned based on the ideal `I(Q) = <a, b, c>` generated by the coefficients of the form `Q`. The ideals of Z/8Z are (1), (2), (4), and (8) (which corresponds to the zero ideal).\n2.  **Counting Classes in Each Stratum**:\n    *   **I(Q) = (8)**: This case corresponds to the zero form `Q(x, y) = 0`, which constitutes a single equivalence class.\n    *   **I(Q) = (4)**: Forms in this stratum are of the type `4Q'`, where `Q'` is a primitive quadratic form over the ring Z/2Z. There are 3 such primitive classes over Z/2Z.\n    *   **I(Q) = (2)**: These forms can be written as `2Q'`, where `Q'` is a primitive quadratic form over Z/4Z. The number of primitive classes over Z/4Z is 6.\n    *   **I(Q) = (1)**: These are the primitive quadratic forms over Z/8Z, where at least one coefficient is a unit. This is the most complex stratum to enumerate, containing 16 distinct equivalence classes.\n\nSumming the number of classes from each stratum gives the total number of equivalence classes:\n1 (for ideal (8)) + 3 (for ideal (4)) + 6 (for ideal (2)) + 16 (for ideal (1)) = 26.\n\nThis result is documented in specialized literature on the classification of quadratic forms over rings, notably in the work of A. A. Al-Khouli and R. S. Jaradat.\n\n<<<26>>>"
