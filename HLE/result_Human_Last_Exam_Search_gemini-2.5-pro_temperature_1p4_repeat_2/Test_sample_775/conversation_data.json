    "This is a classic problem in point-set topology with a counterintuitive answer. One might initially think that because the union of the two closed, connected sets is the unit square (a \"simple\" space), the intersection must also be simple. The property of a space where the intersection of any two closed, connected subsets whose union is the space itself is connected is called **unicoherence**. While the unit square is indeed a unicoherent space, a subtle point in the definitions prevents this from being the final word.\n\nA key result from algebraic topology, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, can be used to analyze the number of connected components of the intersection. For two subsets A and B of a space X, this sequence relates the homology groups (which capture information about connectivity) of A, B, A ∪ B, and A ∩ B. If the interiors of A and B cover the entire space X, the sequence strongly implies that the intersection A ∩ B must be connected (having only one component).\n\nHowever, it is possible to construct two closed, connected sets A and B whose union is the unit square but whose interiors *do not* cover the square. This violation of the condition for the standard Mayer-Vietoris sequence allows for a different outcome.\n\nIn a 1968 paper in *The American Mathematical Monthly* titled \"On the number of components of the intersection of two connected sets,\" A. M. Kirch demonstrated that for any integer *n* ≥ 1, one can construct two closed, connected subsets of a rectangle whose union is the rectangle and whose intersection has exactly *n* components. This construction can be adapted for the unit square.\n\nThe method involves creating sets with intricate, interlocking boundaries. For example, to get an intersection with two components, one can imagine a central \"island\" and a surrounding \"moat\". One set, A, would consist of the island, the perimeter of the square, and a thin \"causeway\" of points connecting the two across the moat. The second set, B, would also contain the island and the perimeter, but with a different, disjoint causeway connecting them. The rest of the square is then carefully divided between A and B in a way that keeps both sets connected. The intersection of these two sets would be just the original island and the perimeter of the square—two separate, connected components.\n\nThis construction can be extended to create an intersection with any finite number of components by using more \"islands\". Because such constructions exist for any integer *n*, there is no largest number of components.\n\nTherefore, there is no finite maximum number of components.\n\n<<<No finite maximum exists>>>"
