    "**Immediately; single-dose ampules must not be stored for any period after opening.**\n\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period. This is because once an ampule is broken open, it becomes an open system that cannot be resealed, creating a high risk of microbial contamination.\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate between a single-dose ampule and a single-dose vial. While a single-dose vial, if punctured in a sterile environment such as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air quality environment, may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, this rule does not apply to ampules.\n\nTherefore, any remaining contents of a single-dose ampule must be discarded immediately after the initial use and should not be stored for future use.\n\n<<<Immediately.>>>"
