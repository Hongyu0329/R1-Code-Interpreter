    "To determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n = 128 vertices, we first need to understand the terms involved.\n\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** A set of 128 points (vertices) and a set of lines (edges) connecting pairs of these vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `s` is often denoted as Kₛ.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices, the induced subgraph consists of those vertices and *all* the edges that connect them in the original graph.\n\nAn induced subgraph that is a clique is a subset of vertices that are all mutually connected in the original graph. This is the standard definition of a clique.\n\nLet G be a graph on 128 vertices. Let S be the set of integers representing the sizes of all possible cliques that can be found as induced subgraphs within G. The problem asks for the maximum possible value of |S|, the number of different sizes in S.\n\nConsider a graph G that contains an induced clique of a certain size, say `k`. Let this clique be formed by a set of `k` vertices, which we can call Vₖ. By definition, every vertex in Vₖ is connected to every other vertex in Vₖ.\n\nNow, let's consider any integer `j` such that `1 <= j < k`. If we choose any subset of `j` vertices from Vₖ, let's call it Vⱼ, this subset is also a clique. The subgraph induced by Vⱼ will be a complete graph of size `j` (a Kⱼ), because all its vertices were part of the larger clique Vₖ and were therefore all interconnected.\n\nThis leads to a crucial conclusion: if a graph G has an induced clique of size `k_max` (where `k_max` is the size of the largest clique, also known as the clique number, ω(G)), it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k_max`. Consequently, the set of all possible clique sizes in G is `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`. The number of different clique sizes is simply `k_max`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for any graph G with 128 vertices. A graph on `n` vertices can, at most, have all its vertices interconnected, forming a complete graph, Kₙ. The clique number of such a graph is `n`.\n\nFor n = 128, the maximum possible clique number is 128. This is achieved by constructing the complete graph on 128 vertices, K₁₂₈. In this graph, any subset of `s` vertices forms a clique of size `s`. Therefore, we can find induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n\nThe set of different clique sizes in K₁₂₈ is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. The number of elements in this set is 128. This is the maximum possible number.\n\n"
