    "The film you are looking for is likely **\"Now and Then,\"** a 1995 coming-of-age film produced by New Line Cinema, a major film studio.\n\nIn the movie, there is a memorable scene where the character Roberta (played by Christina Ricci) rides her bicycle head-on toward a car in a game of \"chicken\" with the local boys. While the bicycle itself isn't distinctly pink in all shots, it has pink and purple elements, including streamers, and the overall aesthetic of the scene, combined with the act of defiance from a teenage girl on her bike against a car, strongly aligns with your description.\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
