    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube with the CFOP method, a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\nThe CFOP method is a popular speedsolving technique that consists of four main stages: Cross, First Two Layers (F2L), Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL), and Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL). OLL ensures the top face of the cube is a single color, and PLL then moves the pieces of the last layer into their correct final positions. There are 21 distinct PLL algorithms to learn for this final step.\n\nRecognizing which of the 21 PLL cases is present is a critical skill for speedcubers. While observing all the non-top-facing stickers on the last layer would certainly allow for identification, it is not the most efficient method. Advanced techniques, often referred to as \"2-sided PLL recognition,\" enable a solver to determine the case by looking at only the stickers on two adjacent faces of the last layer. This involves observing patterns like \"headlights\" (two corner stickers of the same color on a face) and \"blocks\" of solved pieces.\n\nUltimately, the minimum number of stickers required for this recognition has been determined to be five.\n\n<<<5>>>"
