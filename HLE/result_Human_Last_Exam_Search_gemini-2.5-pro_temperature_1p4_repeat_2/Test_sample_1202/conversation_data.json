    "After a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it can have several fates. The most common is for one copy to become a non-functional pseudogene, a process called pseudogenization, and eventually be lost from the genome. However, for a duplicated gene to be retained and diverge, two main mechanisms are considered most likely: neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is the process where one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and evolves a completely new function. This process is driven by adaptive mutation, where the new function provides a benefit and is therefore positively selected by natural selection.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** describes a scenario where the two gene copies divide the original functions of the ancestral gene between them. For instance, if the original gene was active in two different tissues, each duplicated copy might become specialized to function in only one of those tissues. This process can happen through neutral mutations, where each copy loses a different part of its function, making both copies necessary to fulfill the complete role of the original gene.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. Subfunctionalization is often considered a key initial step for retaining duplicates because it provides a pathway for preservation that does not require an immediate, rare, beneficial mutation. By partitioning functions, both copies become essential, protecting them from being lost. Following this preservation, the genes have more evolutionary time to potentially acquire new functions (neofunctionalization). Therefore, some researchers view subfunctionalization as a transient state that facilitates eventual neofunctionalization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth **Neofunctionalization (C)** and **Subfunctionalization (D)** are primary mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   **Neofunctionalization (C)** is the acquisition of a completely new function by one copy.\n*   **Subfunctionalization (D)** is the partitioning of the original ancestral functions between the two copies.\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a powerful, neutral mechanism for the initial preservation of both gene copies, which is a major hurdle to overcome the high likelihood of pseudogenization. Once preserved, these genes can then diverge further, sometimes leading to neofunctionalization. Given that it offers a more common, passive route to retention, subfunctionalization is considered a highly likely and crucial mechanism. However, neofunctionalization is the ultimate source of novel gene functions. Both are key processes. In the context of a multiple-choice question asking for the \"most likely\" mechanism, the choice is nuanced and debated in the scientific literature. Some studies suggest neofunctionalization is prevalent, while others argue that subfunctionalization provides the crucial intermediate step for retention. Both are better answers than the other options.\n\nGiven the options, and recognizing the importance of *initial retention* which subfunctionalization effectively explains via a neutral process, it stands as a very strong candidate. However, both are widely accepted major mechanisms.\n\nTo provide the single best answer, both C and D are critically important. If one must be chosen as \"most likely,\" there isn't a universal consensus as their prevalence can vary. Both are valid and significant mechanisms. For the purpose of selecting a single best option, it depends on whether the question emphasizes the *initial preservation* (favoring subfunctionalization) or the *creation of novel functions* (favoring neofunctionalization). Since both are listed, and both are central to the process, we select the two most viable options. In a typical biology context, both are presented as the core models for duplicate gene fate, besides loss.\n\nWithout a definitive consensus on which is \"more\" likely overall, and since the prompt asks for one answer, we will identify the key processes. Both C and D are the key mechanisms. Let's reconsider the options. Gene conversion (A) homogenizes genes, working against divergence. Pseudogenization (B) is loss, not retention of function. Adaptive radiation (E) is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism of gene divergence. This leaves C and D as the only correct mechanisms listed. Often, subfunctionalization is seen as a common way to preserve genes, which can then later neofunctionalize. This makes it a very frequent and likely mechanism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
