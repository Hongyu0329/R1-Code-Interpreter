    "An analysis of integral surgeries on knots with four or fewer crossings reveals that they can represent **three** distinct elements of the homology cobordism group.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the knots and the corresponding elements they generate:\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** An integral surgery on the unknot with a coefficient of +1 or -1 results in the 3-sphere (S³). In the context of the homology cobordism group, the 3-sphere represents the trivial element, which is the group's identity. This contributes **one** element.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot exists in two forms: a right-handed and a left-handed version, which are mirror images of each other.\n    *   A +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot produces the Poincaré homology sphere, denoted as Σ(2,3,5). This is a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group and is known to have infinite order.\n    *   A -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot results in the same manifold but with the opposite orientation, -Σ(2,3,5). This is the inverse of the element represented by the Poincaré homology sphere in the group.\n    *   Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil produce the same manifolds but with opposite orientations compared to the right-handed trefoil. Specifically, +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil gives -Σ(2,3,5), and -1 surgery gives Σ(2,3,5).\n    *   Thus, the trefoil knot and its mirror image generate **two** distinct non-trivial elements: the class of the Poincaré homology sphere and its inverse.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is indistinguishable from its mirror image. A crucial property of the figure-eight knot is that it is a \"slice\" knot. For any slice knot, performing a ±1 surgery results in a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to the 3-sphere. This means that both +1 and -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot produce the trivial element in the homology cobordism group. Therefore, this knot does not generate any new elements.\n\nIn summary, the distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings are:\n1.  The trivial element (from the unknot and the figure-eight knot).\n2.  The element represented by the Poincaré homology sphere (from the trefoil knot).\n3.  The inverse element represented by the oppositely oriented Poincaré homology sphere (from the trefoil knot).\n\nThis gives a total of three elements.\n\n<<<3>>>"
