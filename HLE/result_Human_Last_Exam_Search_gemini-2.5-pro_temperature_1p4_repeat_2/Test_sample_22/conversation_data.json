    "The statement is **True**.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), which is measured by the proportion of phenotypic variance it can explain (R²), is theoretically capped by the SNP-based heritability (h²_snp) of the trait. SNP-based heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n\nIn practice, the variance explained by a polygenic score is almost always lower than the SNP-based heritability. This discrepancy arises from several factors:\n\n*   **Error in effect size estimates:** The effect sizes of SNPs used to build the PGS are estimated with some degree of error from GWAS data.\n*   **Differences between samples:** The population used to develop the PGS (the base sample) and the population in which the PGS is tested (the target sample) may have differences in genetic architecture or environmental exposures.\n*   **Incomplete information:** Current GWAS may not capture all the genetic variants that contribute to a trait, a phenomenon often referred to as \"missing heritability.\"\n\nTherefore, a PGS is a prediction based on a finite set of known genetic markers and their estimated effects, while SNP heritability is a theoretical estimate of the total variance explained by all common SNPs.\n\nThere is a nuance to this rule. In some specific circumstances, the out-of-sample prediction R² of a PGS has been observed to exceed the *estimated* SNP-based heritability. This can occur when the SNP heritability is calculated from a meta-analysis of multiple, heterogeneous cohorts. If there are significant differences in the genetic heritability or genetic correlations between these cohorts, the resulting meta-analyzed SNP heritability can be an underestimate of the true heritability within a more homogeneous target sample. In such cases, a PGS developed from a large and powerful GWAS might explain more variance in the target sample than the underestimated SNP heritability value would suggest. However, this scenario represents a specific case related to the estimation of SNP heritability rather than a violation of the fundamental principle that the true total heritability sets the ceiling for prediction.\n\n<<<True>>>"
