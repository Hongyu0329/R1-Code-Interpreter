    "The Wittig reaction is a method used to convert aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. The reaction involves a triphenyl phosphonium ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with an aldehyde or ketone. The outcome is an alkene where the carbon-oxygen double bond of the carbonyl group is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond, and a byproduct of triphenylphosphine oxide is formed. A key benefit of this reaction is that the position of the new double bond is precisely where the carbonyl group was located.\n\nTo determine the product of the specified reaction, the two reactants must be identified:\n*   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde, which has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the phenyl group has a chlorine atom at position 2 (ortho).\n\nThe reaction proceeds by forming a new double bond between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the ylidic carbon of the Wittig reagent.\n\nThe (CH₃)₃C-CH= part of the product comes from pivalaldehyde.\nThe =CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄) part of the product comes from the ylide.\n\nCombining these two fragments gives the final alkene structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄).\n\nThe systematic name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe Wittig reaction can produce both E and Z stereoisomers of the alkene. The stereochemical outcome often depends on the nature of the ylide. The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, is considered an unstabilized ylide. Reactions with unstabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the Z-isomer. Therefore, the reaction is expected to yield a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, likely with the (Z)-isomer as the major product.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
