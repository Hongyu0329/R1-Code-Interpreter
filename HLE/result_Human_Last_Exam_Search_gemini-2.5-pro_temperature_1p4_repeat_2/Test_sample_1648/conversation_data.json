    "The largest natural number *n* such that the (2n)th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 2.\n\nThe determination of this number relies on advanced results in algebraic K-theory, specifically the calculation of the K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$. The ring in question is $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, which corresponds to the case where *p* = 3 and *k* = 3.\n\nThe calculation of these K-groups was a long-standing problem, with significant progress made by Lars Hesselholt and Ib Madsen, who connected K-theory to topological cyclic homology. Their work provides a complete, though complex, description of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$.\n\nA simplified and more accessible formulation of their results, particularly for the even-indexed K-groups, has been provided by Charles Weibel. For an odd prime *p*, the even K-group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is given by:\n*   A cyclic group of order $p^{\\min(k, v_p(n)+1)}$ if $2n \\le 2k-2$.\n*   The trivial group (i.e., it is zero) if $2n > 2k-2$.\n\nHere, $v_p(n)$ denotes the p-adic valuation of *n*, which is the highest power of *p* that divides *n*.\n\nFor the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have *p* = 3 and *k* = 3. The condition for the K-group to be non-zero is $2n \\le 2(3)-2 = 4$. This implies that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ must be zero for any *n* > 2 (for instance, $K_6(\\mathbb{Z}/27)=0$, $K_8(\\mathbb{Z}/27)=0$, etc.).\n\nThe largest natural number *n* that could potentially have a non-zero $(2n)$th K-group is therefore *n* = 2. We can check if $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is indeed non-zero using the first part of the formula. For *n* = 2, we have 2*n* = 4, which satisfies the condition $4 \\le 4$.\n\nThe order of $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is $3^{\\min(3, v_3(2)+1)}$. Since 2 is not divisible by 3, the 3-adic valuation $v_3(2)$ is 0. The order is therefore $3^{\\min(3, 0+1)} = 3^1 = 3$.\n\nSince the order of $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is 3, the group is non-zero. As all even K-groups with an index greater than 4 are zero, the largest natural number *n* for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero is 2. Recent work by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus provides new algorithms and confirms the vanishing of even K-groups in high degrees.\n\n<<<2>>>"
