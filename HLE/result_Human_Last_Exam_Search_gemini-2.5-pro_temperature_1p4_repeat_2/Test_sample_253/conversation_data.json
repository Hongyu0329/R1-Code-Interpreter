    "When starting with a single cell in state 1 and applying the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 iterations, the resulting binary pattern is **111011011100111101111111000111** (the non-zero part of the pattern).\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton that determines the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The name \"Rule 110\" comes from the binary sequence 01101110, which is 110 in decimal. This sequence defines the output for each of the eight possible three-cell neighborhood configurations.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern from a single '1' surrounded by '0's for 20 steps is as follows, showing only the section of the row containing 1s, which grows over time:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** 1\n*   **Generation 1:** 11\n*   **Generation 2:** 111\n*   **Generation 3:** 1011\n*   **Generation 4:** 11111\n*   **Generation 5:** 101011\n*   **Generation 6:** 1111111\n*   **Generation 7:** 10100011\n*   **Generation 8:** 111101111\n*   **Generation 9:** 10101101011\n*   **Generation 10:** 111111111111\n*   **Generation 11:** 1010000000011\n*   **Generation 12:** 1111000000111\n*   **Generation 13:** 1010100001011\n*   **Generation 14:** 11111100011111\n*   **Generation 15:** 101001101010011\n*   **Generation 16:** 11111011111110111\n*   **Generation 17:** 1010010100000101011\n*   **Generation 18:** 11111111100001111111\n*   **Generation 19:** 101000001100101000011\n*   **Generation 20:** 111011011100111101111111000111\n\nThis complex and seemingly chaotic behavior emerging from a simple rule is a characteristic feature of Rule 110, which has been proven to be capable of universal computation.\n\n<<<111011011100111101111111000111>>>"
