    "Answering your question requires a deep dive into the vocabularies of numerous, geographically dispersed Asian languages and an examination of their historical interactions. The search for two languages from distinct Asian cultures with no direct contact, yet sharing highly similar words for \"broom,\" \"mom,\" and \"dad,\" presents a unique linguistic challenge.\n\nAfter extensive research, it has not been possible to identify two languages that meet all these specific criteria simultaneously. The primary obstacle is the word \"broom,\" as the terms for \"mom\" and \"dad\" often exhibit similarities across unrelated languages.\n\n### The Case of \"Mom\" and \"Dad\"\n\nWords for \"mother\" and \"father\" that sound like \"mama\" and \"papa\" or \"dada\" are remarkably common across the globe. This phenomenon is largely attributed to the nature of language acquisition in infants. The sounds /m/, /p/, and /b/ are among the first consonants babies can produce, and the /a/ vowel is the easiest to create. Consequently, babbling sounds like \"mama\" and \"papa\" are often the first vocalizations, which parents then associate with themselves.\n\nFor instance, consider the similarities between **Korean** and **Tamil**, a Dravidian language from Southern India:\n\n*   **Mom:** In Korean, the informal word is **엄마 (eomma)**, which is strikingly similar to the Tamil word for mother, **அம்மா (amma)**.\n*   **Dad:** Similarly, the informal Korean word for dad is **아빠 (appa)**, which closely resembles the Tamil **அப்பா (appa)**.\n\nWhile the lexical similarity for \"mom\" and \"dad\" is high, the word for \"broom\" in these two languages is entirely different:\n\n*   **Broom:** In Korean, it is **비 (bi)** or **빗자루 (bisjalu)**, while in Tamil it is **துடைப்பம் (thudaippam)**.\n\nFurthermore, the condition of \"no direct contact\" is not definitively met. Historical evidence points to ancient maritime trade and cultural exchanges, particularly the spread of Buddhism from India to the Korean peninsula, suggesting at least indirect historical connections.\n\n### The Challenge of \"Broom\"\n\nUnlike the near-universal sounds for parents, the word for \"broom\" is culturally and linguistically specific, with no discernible pattern of similarity across language families without direct contact. Investigations into a wide array of Asian languages, including **Tagalog** (\"walis\"), **Persian** (\"jaru\"), **Turkish** (\"süpürge\"), **Georgian** (\"tsotskhi\"), **Armenian** (\"avel\"), **Mongolian** (\"шүүр\" - shüür), and **Khmer** (\"អំបោស\" - âmpous), reveal a wide diversity in their terms for this object.\n\nIn conclusion, while many Asian languages share remarkably similar informal terms for \"mom\" and \"dad,\" this similarity does not extend to the word for \"broom.\" The arbitrary nature of the word for a common household item like a broom means that finding a coincidental match in two languages from cultures with no direct contact is highly improbable. Based on the available linguistic and historical data, there are no two languages in Asia that satisfy all three conditions of your request.\n\n<<<I was unable to find two languages that meet all the specified criteria.>>>"
