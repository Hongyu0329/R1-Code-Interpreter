    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we analyze the curve and its reduction. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n\n**1. Birational Transformation to a Standard Hyperelliptic Form:**\nThe given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. To analyze its stable reduction, it is convenient to transform it into the form $w^2 = F(y)$, where $F(y)$ is a polynomial of degree $2g+2=6$.\nThe initial equation is $z^2 = P(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The branch points of this cover are the five roots of $P(x)$ and the point at infinity.\nWe perform a change of variables $x=1/y$. The equation becomes:\n$z^2 = \\frac{2}{y^5} + \\frac{2}{y^3} + 1 = \\frac{2+2y^2+y^5}{y^5}$\nTo clear the denominator, we introduce a new variable $w = z y^3$. This yields:\n$w^2 = y(y^5+2y^2+2)$\nLet $Q(y) = y^5+2y^2+2$. The new equation is $w^2 = yQ(y)$, a polynomial of degree 6. The branch points are now the roots of $yQ(y)=0$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Branch Points:**\nThe branch points are the roots of $F(y) = y(y^5+2y^2+2)$, which are $y=0$ and the five roots of $Q(y)=y^5+2y^2+2$.\nLet's analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $Q(y)$. We use the Newton polygon for $Q(y)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v=v_2$. The coefficients of $Q(y)$ are $c_5=1, c_2=2, c_0=2$. The corresponding points for the Newton polygon are $(0, v(c_5))=(0,0)$, $(3, v(c_2))=(3,1)$, and $(5, v(c_0))=(5,1)$. (Using the convention of plotting $(i, v(a_{n-i}))$.) Alternatively, using points $(i, v(c_i))$, we have $(5,0)$, $(2,1)$, and $(0,1)$. The lower convex hull of these points is a single segment connecting $(0,1)$ and $(5,0)$. The slope of this segment is $(0-1)/(5-0) = -1/5$. This implies that all five roots of $Q(y)$, let's call them $\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5$, have a valuation of $-(-1/5)=1/5$. This requires passing to a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, for instance $K=\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{2})$, where the valuation $v$ is extended and normalized such that $v(2)=1$, which means the uniformizer $\\pi = \\sqrt{2}$ has $v(\\pi)=1/5$.\n\nThe set of branch points is thus $B = \\{0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5\\}$. Let's analyze the distances between them:\n*   $v(\\beta_i - \\beta_j)$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,\\dots,5\\}$. Since $v(\\beta_i)=1/5$, we can write $\\beta_i = \\pi u_i$ where $u_i$ is a unit in the ring of integers of $K$. One can show that the reductions of all $u_i$ in the residue field are 1. This implies that $v(u_i-u_j)>0$, and therefore $v(\\beta_i - \\beta_j) = v(\\pi(u_i-u_j)) = 1/5 + v(u_i-u_j) > 1/5$.\n*   $v(\\beta_i - 0) = v(\\beta_i) = 1/5$.\n\n**3. The Stable Reduction and Thickness of the Node:**\nThe stable reduction of the curve is determined by the clustering of the branch points. A node in the special fiber of the stable model arises when the set of branch points partitions into two sets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, that are separated from each other.\nIn our case, the set of roots of $Q(y)$, $S_2 = \\{\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5\\}$, are all closer to each other than they are to the root $S_1=\\{0\\}$. The \"distance\" between the two sets is $\\delta = v(0-\\beta_i)=1/5$. This configuration leads to a stable model with a double point (node) that separates a component corresponding to the cluster $S_2$ from a component related to the point in $S_1$.\n\nFor a curve of the form $w^2=yQ(y)$, where the roots of $Q(y)$ are close to 0, the thickness of the node that separates the branch point $y=0$ from the roots of $Q(y)$ is given by $v(Q(0))$.\n\nIn our case, $Q(y) = y^5+2y^2+2$.\n$Q(0)=2$.\nThe thickness of the double point is therefore $v(Q(0)) = v(2)$.\nGiven that the valuation $v$ is normalized to $v(2)=1$, the thickness is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
