    "There are exactly 26 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset S of a group G is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements a and b in S (including a=b), their product ab is not in S. Such a set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (or \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. They proved that if a finite group G has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3, then the order of G must be less than or equal to 24. Their work provides a complete list of all such groups.\n\nThe 26 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₁, C₁₂, C₁₃, C₁₄, C₁₅, C₂₀, C₂₂ and C₂₄\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D₆, D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, and D₁₄\n*   **Quaternion group:** Q₈\n*   **Alternating group:** A₄\n*   **Special Linear group:** SL(2,3)\n*   **Other abelian groups:** C₂ × C₂, C₂ × C₄, C₂ × C₆, and C₃ × C₃.\n\n<<<26>>>"
