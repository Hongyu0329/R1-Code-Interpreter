The potential for free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion depends on their specific atomic structure. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets have a centrosymmetric crystal lattice, which intrinsically forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. In contrast, certain polymorphs of borophene possess a non-centrosymmetric structure, making them theoretically capable of exhibiting SPDC. Therefore, while not expected in h-BN, it is a possibility in specific forms of borophene.
