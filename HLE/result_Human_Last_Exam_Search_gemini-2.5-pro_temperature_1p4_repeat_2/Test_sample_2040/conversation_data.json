    "### Free-standing Boron Nanosheets and Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion: A Tale of Two Structures\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets would not be universally expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The potential for this quantum optical phenomenon hinges critically on the specific atomic arrangement of the nanosheet, with certain forms of borophene showing promise while hexagonal boron nitride does not.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process in which a high-energy photon, known as the pump photon, is converted into two lower-energy photons—the signal and idler. This process is fundamental to generating entangled photon pairs and is contingent on a material possessing a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). A key requirement for a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, meaning the material's structure lacks a central point of inversion.\n\nWhen considering free-standing boron nanosheets, it is crucial to distinguish between its two primary forms: hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets and borophene.\n\n**Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Nanosheets:**\nOften referred to as \"white graphene,\" h-BN nanosheets possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure, similar to that of graphene. Due to this symmetry, the intrinsic second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of pristine h-BN is expected to be zero. Consequently, free-standing h-BN nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Experimental studies on the nonlinear optical properties of h-BN have primarily focused on third-order nonlinear effects, such as reverse saturable absorption.\n\n**Borophene:**\nBorophene, a single atomic layer of boron, can exist in several different structural configurations, or polymorphs. Some of these structures, such as buckled δ6-borophene, are non-centrosymmetric. This lack of inversion symmetry means that these forms of borophene can possess a non-zero second-order hyperpolarizability, making them theoretically capable of exhibiting SPDC. In fact, theoretical studies have predicted that multilayer borophene could have a significant second-order nonlinear optical response.\n\nIt is also worth noting that defects, doping, or strain in a typically centrosymmetric material can break the local symmetry, potentially inducing a second-order nonlinear response. However, this would not be an intrinsic property of the perfect crystal structure. Studies have shown that the optical properties of h-BN can be influenced by defects and the substrate.\n\nIn conclusion, the likelihood of observing spontaneous parametric down-conversion in free-standing boron nanosheets is entirely dependent on the specific allotrope. While it is not an expected phenomenon in the commonly studied hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets due to their crystal symmetry, the non-centrosymmetric nature of certain borophene polymorphs makes them promising candidates for this important quantum optical process.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The potential for free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion depends on their specific atomic structure. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets have a centrosymmetric crystal lattice, which intrinsically forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. In contrast, certain polymorphs of borophene possess a non-centrosymmetric structure, making them theoretically capable of exhibiting SPDC. Therefore, while not expected in h-BN, it is a possibility in specific forms of borophene."
