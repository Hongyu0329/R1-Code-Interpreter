    "The reaction between 1,3-butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a dienophile) is a Diels-Alder reaction. This type of reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\nIn this specific reaction, the four pi electrons from 1,3-butadiene and the two pi electrons from 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene rearrange to form a cyclohexene derivative. Two new single bonds and one new double bond are formed in a single, concerted step.\n\nThe resulting product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nHere is the chemical reaction:\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   1,3-Butadiene: CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂\n    *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: CCl₂=CF₂\n\n*   **Product:**\n    *   A cyclohexene ring where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (from the original central carbons of butadiene).\n    *   A -CF₂- group is attached at carbon 5.\n    *   A -CCl₂- group is attached at carbon 4.\n\nThe reaction between dienes and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene is a known method for cycloaddition. While related reactions, like the one with tetrafluoroethylene, can sometimes favor a [2+2] cycloaddition product under kinetic control, the Diels-Alder [4+2] adduct is typically the thermodynamically favored product.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
