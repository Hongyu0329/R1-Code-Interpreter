    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" indicates a molecule where all carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds have been replaced by carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds. A nanocar is a single-molecule machine, first designed in 2005 at Rice University by a group led by Professor James Tour. These molecules typically consist of a chassis and four wheels, often made of fullerene.\n\nWhile several designs for nanocars exist, a scientific paper describing a nanocar with a flexible chassis provides the molecular formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. To create a perfluoronanocar from this structure, every hydrogen atom would be substituted with a fluorine atom. Consequently, all 34 hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule would be replaced by 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
