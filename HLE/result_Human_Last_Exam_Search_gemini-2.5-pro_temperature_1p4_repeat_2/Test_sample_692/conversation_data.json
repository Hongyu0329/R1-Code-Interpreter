    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is December 8, 36 BCE. This date is inscribed on Stela 2, a stone monument discovered at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nThe inscription on Stela 2 is in the form of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, a sophisticated system of timekeeping. The date is recorded as 7.16.3.2.13. While the carving style is considered post-Olmec or epi-Olmec, it is not Mayan. The discovery of this stela was significant because it demonstrated that the Long Count calendar was in use before the rise of the Classic Maya civilization.\n\nOther early calendrical inscriptions have been found in the Americas. For instance, Stela C from Tres Zapotes, another epi-Olmec site, bears a Long Count date corresponding to 32 BCE. Additionally, mural fragments from San Bartolo, Guatemala, depict the date \"7 Deer\" from the 260-day sacred calendar, dating to between 300 and 200 BCE. While the San Bartolo inscription is older, it marks a day within a ritual cycle rather than a specific historical year. Similarly, Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San Jos√© Mogote features a glyph for \"1 Earthquake\" dated to around 600 BCE, but this also represents a day name rather than a complete date.\n\nTherefore, the inscription on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo remains the earliest known complete date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system in the Americas.\n\n<<<December 8, 36 BCE>>>"
