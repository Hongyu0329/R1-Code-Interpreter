    "The search results confirm my initial analysis. The key to winning this specific game state is to create a \"double threat\" or a \"trap\". This is a situation where a player creates two potential winning lines with a single move, and the opponent can only block one of them in their next turn.\n\nMy analysis of the board identified two such moves: c4 and f4.\n\n- **Move c4**: This move creates a line of three 'O's in row 4 (`c4, d4, e4`) with open spaces at both `b4` and `f4`. The opponent, X, can only place their token in one of these columns. On O's next turn, they will place their token in the other open column to complete a line of four and win.\n\n- **Move f4**: This move similarly creates a line of three 'O's in row 4 (`d4, e4, f4`) with open spaces at `c4` and `g4`. The opponent can only block one of these, allowing 'O' to win on the subsequent turn.\n\nI checked for any immediate (1-move) wins for 'O' and found none. I also confirmed that the opponent 'X' does not have an immediate winning move that 'O' must block. Therefore, creating a scenario that guarantees a win on the next turn is the fastest possible way for 'O' to win.\n\nThe search results support this as an advanced and effective strategy. The concept of forcing a move and creating double threats is a core principle of high-level Connect 4 play.\n\nThus, the optimal moves for 'O' are indeed c4 and f4.\n\nI have all the necessary information to provide the final answer.\n\nc4, f4\n>>>\nc4, f4"
