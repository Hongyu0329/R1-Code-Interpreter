The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial for the calculation of normalized magnetic helicity. The calculation is performed using magnetic field components perpendicular to the local magnetic field, which is determined by averaging the magnetic field vector over a short time interval and then rotating the coordinate system to align with this local field direction.
