    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is 2-resolvable.\n\nHere is the reasoning that leads to this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Definition of a Tame Functor**: A functor $F: J \\to C$ from a poset $J$ to a category $C$ is called tame if there exists a functor from a finite poset $I$ to $J$, say $\\iota: I \\to J$, and a functor $G: I \\to C$ such that $F$ is isomorphic to the left Kan extension of $G$ along $\\iota$. This essentially means that the behavior of the functor on the infinite poset $J$ is determined by its values on a finite subposet.\n\n2.  **Definition of n-resolvable**: A functor is defined as *n-resolvable* if it admits a projective resolution of length $n$. The terminology in this field has specific meanings for small values of $n$:\n    *   A **1-resolvable** functor is also known as *finitely generated*.\n    *   A **2-resolvable** functor is also known as *finitely presented*.\n\n3.  **The Connection for Upper Semilattices**: A crucial result connects the concepts of tame functors and being finitely presented when the domain is an upper semilattice. For a functor $F: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ where $J$ is a poset, the functor is **finitely presented** if and only if it is **tame**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ over an upper semilattice $J$ is equivalent to a finitely presented functor, and being finitely presented is the definition of being 2-resolvable, the value of $n$ must be 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
