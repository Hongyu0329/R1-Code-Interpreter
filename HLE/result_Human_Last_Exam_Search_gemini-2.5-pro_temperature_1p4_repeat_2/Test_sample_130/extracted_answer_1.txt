The edges of the image will evolve as if they are moving by their mean curvature. Specifically, sharp corners will be rounded, convex shapes will shrink and disappear, and the overall length of the boundary between black and white regions will decrease over time. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the image will converge to a state with minimal edge length, which may be an image of a single solid color.
