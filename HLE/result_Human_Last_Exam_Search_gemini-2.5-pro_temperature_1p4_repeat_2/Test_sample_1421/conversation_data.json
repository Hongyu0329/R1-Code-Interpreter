    "In the imaginary time representation of Feynman's path integral formalism, the partition function Z for a system of fermions is expressed as a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields. This formalism is essential because it correctly incorporates the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions.\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function is:\n<br>\n***\n### Formula\nThe partition function Z is given by:\n<p align=\"center\">\n  $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi \\ e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n</p>\n\nwhere:\n*   **$Z$** is the partition function.\n*   **$\\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi$** represents the functional integral, or path integral, over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields. These fields, $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau)$, are not ordinary numbers but are independent **Grassmann variables**, which anticommute:\n    *   $\\psi(x, \\tau)\\psi(y, \\sigma) = -\\psi(y, \\sigma)\\psi(x, \\tau)$\n    *   This property ensures that the Pauli exclusion principle is respected.\n*   **$S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$** is the **Euclidean action** for the fermionic fields, defined in imaginary time. The use of the Euclidean action arises from the Wick rotation of the time coordinate ($t \\rightarrow -i\\tau$), which transforms the quantum mechanical evolution operator into the statistical mechanical density operator. The general form of the Euclidean action is:\n    <p align=\"center\">\n      $S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^dx \\ \\mathcal{L}_E(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi, \\partial_\\mu \\bar{\\psi}, \\partial_\\mu \\psi)$\n    </p>\n    Here, $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is the Euclidean Lagrangian density. For a common case of non-interacting fermions, the action is typically of the form:\n    <p align=\"center\">\n      $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^dx \\ \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) \\left( \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + H \\right) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n    </p>\n*   **$\\beta$** is the inverse temperature, defined as $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. The integration in imaginary time $\\tau$ runs from $0$ to $\\beta$.\n*   **$H$** is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator, which typically includes the kinetic energy and any potential terms. For example, for a free, non-relativistic fermion, $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 \\nabla^2}{2m} - \\mu$, where $m$ is the mass and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\n***\n### Boundary Conditions\nA critical feature of the fermionic path integral in the imaginary time formalism is the choice of boundary conditions for the fields. To correctly reproduce the trace operation in the partition function ($Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$), the Grassmann fields must be **anti-periodic** in the imaginary time direction. This means:\n<p align=\"center\">\n  $\\psi(x, \\tau + \\beta) = -\\psi(x, \\tau)$\n  <br>\n  $\\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau + \\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau)$\n</p>\n\nThis is in contrast to bosonic fields, which require periodic boundary conditions. This anti-periodicity is a direct consequence of the fermionic nature of the particles.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi \\ e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ that are anti-periodic in the imaginary time variable $\\tau$ with period $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$. The term $S_E$ is the Euclidean action, which for a typical system of non-interacting fermions is $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^dx \\ \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) \\left( \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + H \\right) \\psi(x, \\tau)$, with $H$ being the single-particle Hamiltonian.>>>"
