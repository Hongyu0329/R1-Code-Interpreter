The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynmanâ€™s path integral formalism is given by $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi}\mathcal{D}\psi \ e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$ that are anti-periodic in the imaginary time variable $\tau$ with period $\beta=1/(k_B T)$. The term $S_E$ is the Euclidean action, which for a typical system of non-interacting fermions is $S_E = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^dx \ \bar{\psi}(x, \tau) \left( \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} + H \right) \psi(x, \tau)$, with $H$ being the single-particle Hamiltonian.
