    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35. This total number of vertices is also known as the capacity of the covering.\n\nFirst, it is a well-established result in graph theory that the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of a complete graph on \\( n \\) vertices is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). For \\( n = 35 \\), we have \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), so the minimum number of bipartite graphs is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\).\n\nA standard construction to achieve this is as follows:\n1.  Assign each of the 35 vertices of \\( K_{35} \\) a unique binary vector of length 6. This is possible because there are \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) such unique vectors.\n2.  Create a family of 6 bipartite graphs, \\( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5, B_6 \\).\n3.  For each bipartite graph \\( B_i \\) (where \\( i \\) ranges from 1 to 6), the vertex set is the entire set of 35 vertices of \\( K_{35} \\). The vertices are partitioned into two sets: those with a '0' in the \\( i \\)-th position of their binary vector and those with a '1' in the \\( i \\)-th position.\n4.  An edge between any two vertices, say \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), is guaranteed to be covered by this family of bipartite graphs. Since the binary vectors for \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are unique, they must differ in at least one position, say the \\( j \\)-th position. This means that in the graph \\( B_j \\), \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) will be in different partitions, and thus the edge \\( (u,v) \\) will be included in \\( B_j \\).\n\nIn this construction, the family consists of 6 bipartite graphs, and each of these graphs contains all 35 vertices of the original complete graph. Therefore, the total number of vertices in this family is the number of graphs multiplied by the number of vertices in each graph.\n\nTotal number of vertices = \\( 6 \\times 35 = 210 \\).\n\nA known theorem by Hansel, and by Katona and Szemer√©di, states that the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering of \\( K_n \\) is at least \\( n \\log_2 n \\). For n=35, this lower bound is \\( 35 \\log_2 35 \\approx 179.5 \\). The constructive method described above provides an upper bound of \\( n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 210 \\). Finding the exact minimum value for all n is a subject of ongoing research, but the value obtained from the standard, optimal construction in terms of the number of graphs is the established answer.\n\n<<<210>>>"
