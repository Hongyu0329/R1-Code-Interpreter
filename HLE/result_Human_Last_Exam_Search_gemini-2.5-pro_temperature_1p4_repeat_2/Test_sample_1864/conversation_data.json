    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare a minimum of 12 essential control samples. The success and accuracy of a multicolor flow cytometry experiment, especially for cell sorting, rely heavily on a comprehensive set of controls to ensure proper instrument setup, correct data interpretation, and accurate gating.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n*   **1. Unstained Control (1 sample):** This sample contains only the cells or beads without any fluorescent labels. It is the most fundamental control used to:\n    *   Set the initial voltage settings for the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) channels to visualize your population of interest.\n    *   Measure the level of natural background fluorescence (autofluorescence) from your cells or beads in each detector.\n\n*   **2. Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 samples):** Because this is a multicolor experiment, the emission spectra of the different fluorochromes can overlap, causing a signal from one dye to be detected in another's channel (spillover). Compensation is a mathematical correction for this spillover. To calculate this accurately, you need one control sample for each fluorochrome in your panel:\n    *   A sample stained only with AF350.\n    *   A sample stained only with GFP.\n    *   A sample stained only with PE.\n    *   A sample stained only with AF647.\n    *   A sample stained only with AF750.\n    These can be prepared using cells or specialized antibody-capture beads (compensation beads). Each control must contain a clearly identifiable positive and negative population for the software to calculate the spillover values.\n\n*   **3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, which is especially important for sorting. An FMO control contains all the fluorescent labels in your panel *except for one*. This type of control reveals the spread of fluorescence from the other colors into the channel you have left out, allowing you to distinguish between true low-level positive signals and background fluorescence. For a five-color panel, you will need five FMO controls:\n    *   FMO for AF350 (stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750)\n    *   FMO for GFP (stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750)\n    *   FMO for PE (stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750)\n    *   FMO for AF647 (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750)\n    *   FMO for AF750 (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647)\n\n*   **4. Streptavidin-Only Control (1 sample):** Since your experiment uses fluorescently labeled streptavidin to detect biotinylated antibodies, it's essential to have a control that checks for non-specific binding of the streptavidin itself. This sample should contain your cells or beads incubated with the fluorescent streptavidin conjugates but *without* any of the biotinylated primary antibodies. A low signal in this control confirms that the fluorescence you see in your fully stained sample is due to specific antibody binding.\n\n**Strong Recommendation for Sorting Experiments: Viability Dye**\n\nFor any flow cytometry experiment involving cell sorting (FACS), including a viability dye is considered essential. Dead cells can increase autofluorescence and non-specifically bind antibodies, leading to false-positive results and reduced purity of the sorted populations.\n\nIf you add a viability dye, you would need to prepare one additional control:\n*   **A single-color compensation control for the viability dye itself.** This would bring your total number of essential controls to **13**.\n\nIn summary, for the five specified channels, 12 controls are essential. However, for a high-quality sorting experiment, adding a viability dye and its corresponding control is standard practice.\n\n<<<12>>>"
