    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag.\n\n### Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe Danish flag, the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. When this design is represented as a matrix, the colors are assigned distinct numerical values to maximize the rank. For instance, red can be represented by the number 1 and white by 2.\n\nA matrix of the Danish flag would have rows representing the horizontal sections of the flag. This results in two distinct types of row vectors:\n1.  Rows that are entirely white (for the horizontal bar of the cross).\n2.  Rows that are mostly red but interrupted by the white vertical bar of the cross.\n\nFor example, a simplified representation would have the row vectors `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` for the white stripe and `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` for a red stripe. These two vectors are linearly independent because one cannot be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other. Any other row in the flag's matrix will be identical to one of these two types. Since there are two linearly independent row types, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nWe must now find flags of African nations whose designs also result in a maximal rank of 2. This requires a design that generates exactly two linearly independent row (or column) vectors.\n\nSimple designs such as horizontal or vertical tricolors (e.g., Mali, Gabon) result in a rank of 1, because each row vector is a scalar multiple of the others. The flag's design must have a feature that breaks this simple linear dependence. This is often achieved by combining vertical and horizontal elements or by adding a central charge that alters one of the stripes.\n\nBased on this principle, the following African flags have a design that gives them a linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Guinea-Bissau:** The flag has a red vertical band on the hoist side and two horizontal stripes, yellow and green, on the fly side. A black star is centered on the red band. This construction creates row vectors of the types `[Red+Star, Yellow]` and `[Red, Green]`. The differing elements in these rows ensure they are linearly independent, but the overall structure limits the rank to 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar:** This flag features a white vertical band on the hoist side, with red and green horizontal stripes on the fly side. This creates two distinct row vector types: `[White, Red, Red]` and `[White, Green, Green]`. These two vectors are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Mauritania:** The flag consists of a green field with a central gold crescent and star, flanked by two red horizontal bands at the top and bottom. The unique row containing the crescent is not a scalar multiple of the plain red or green rows. The rows for the red and green bands are themselves linearly dependent (one is a multiple of the other). The basis of the row space is formed by a plain stripe vector and the crescent-stripe vector, making the rank 2.\n\n*   **Niger:** The flag is a horizontal tricolor of orange, white, and green, with an orange roundel in the center of the white stripe. The plain orange and green stripes are linearly dependent on each other. However, the white stripe containing the orange circle (`[White, White, Orange, White, White]`) is linearly independent of the plain stripes. This results in two basis vectors for the row space, and thus a rank of 2.\n\n<<<The flags of Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Niger have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.>>>"
