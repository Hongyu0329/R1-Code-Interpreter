  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order.

    "To solve this problem in the most memory-efficient way, the program should avoid storing the entire input string in memory. Instead, it can read the input character by character, count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4', and then print the new sum based on these counts. This approach, known as counting sort, is highly effective because the set of numbers is very small.\n\nBy using the smallest appropriate data types for the variables, we can further minimize memory usage. For example, a `short` is sufficient to hold the counts of the numbers (as the input string is at most 1000 characters, the maximum count for any single digit is about 500), and a `char` can be used for small loop counters. Note that the variable used with `getchar()` must be an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` (End-of-File) value.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) from the input,\n * sorts the numbers in non-decreasing order, and prints the new sum.\n * It is optimized for memory efficiency by not storing the entire\n * input string and by using the smallest suitable data types for variables.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Variable Declarations and Memory Calculation:\n\n    // counts: Array to store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    // A 'short' (typically 2 bytes) is sufficient as the max count is ~500.\n    // Memory: 4 * sizeof(short) = 8 bytes\n    short counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // c: Variable to read input character by character using getchar().\n    // Must be 'int' to correctly handle the special EOF value.\n    // Memory: 1 * sizeof(int) = 4 bytes\n    int c;\n\n    // total_numbers: Counter for the '+' signs. A 'short' is sufficient.\n    // Memory: 1 * sizeof(short) = 2 bytes\n    short total_numbers = 0;\n\n    // i, j: Loop counters. 'char' and 'short' are sufficient for their ranges.\n    // Memory: 1 * sizeof(char) + 1 * sizeof(short) = 1 + 2 = 3 bytes\n    char i;\n    short j;\n\n    // --- Phase 1: Read input and count numbers ---\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n            total_numbers++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // --- Phase 2: Print the sorted sum ---\n    int first_term = 1; // Flag to handle printing of '+'\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            if (!first_term) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            putchar('1' + i);\n            first_term = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all variables declared in the `main` function. Assuming a common architecture where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, the calculation is as follows:\n\n*   `short counts[4]`: 4 * 2 bytes = 8 bytes\n*   `int c`: 1 * 4 bytes = 4 bytes\n*   `short total_numbers`: 1 * 2 bytes = 2 bytes\n*   `char i`: 1 * 1 byte = 1 byte\n*   `short j`: 1 * 2 bytes = 2 bytes\n*   `int first_term`: 1 * 4 bytes = 4 bytes\n\n**Total memory (m)** = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 21 bytes.\n\n<<<21>>>"
