    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself is **G**.\n\nNewton ingeniously mapped the seven colors of the visible spectrum to the seven notes of a musical scale. In his system, the color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. Following the spectral order on his circle, the color that lies between yellow and blue is green.\n\nThe specific musical scale Newton used was the Dorian mode, starting on the note D. This creates the following association between colors and notes:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range from the color produced by mixing yellow and blue (green) to blue. On Newton's circle, the color immediately following yellow is green, which is then followed by blue. Therefore, the range in question is primarily represented by the color green. The musical note assigned to green in Newton's system is **G**.\n\n<<<G>>>"
