    "The pattern of the sequence is that each number `n` must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  `n` is a multiple of 6.\n2.  `n - 1` is a prime number.\n\nLet's verify this for the last few terms in the sequence:\n*   For `n = 2340`, `2340` is a multiple of 6 (`2340 / 6 = 390`), and `2340 - 1 = 2339`, which is a prime number.\n*   For `n = 2352`, `2352` is a multiple of 6 (`2352 / 6 = 392`), and `2352 - 1 = 2351`, which is a prime number.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to find the smallest integer `n` greater than 2352 that satisfies both conditions. We can test multiples of 6 greater than 2352:\n*   `n = 2358`: `2358` is a multiple of 6. We check if `2358 - 1 = 2357` is prime. 2357 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root (approximately 48.5), so 2357 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
