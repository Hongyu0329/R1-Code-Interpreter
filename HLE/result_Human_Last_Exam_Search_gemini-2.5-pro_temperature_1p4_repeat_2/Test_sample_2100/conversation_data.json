    "The man Andrei Voznesensky wrote about is Nikolai Rezanov. The poet's rock opera, \"Juno and Avos,\" is based on his poem \"Avos!\" and chronicles the life and tragic romance of Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer.\n\nNikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk and was buried at the cemetery of the Resurrection Cathedral. For a long time, the exact location of his grave was a mystery, particularly after the cathedral was demolished in the mid-20th century and the cemetery was lost. The question of his final resting place was answered in the 1990s when the burial site was located through the efforts of local historian Olga Arzhanykh. The remains were then reburied at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk. A new monument now marks his grave, with an inscription that echoes a famous line from Voznesensky's work.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
