A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed by using a prime-order group where the Discrete Logarithm Problem is hard, a secure hash function, and Shamir's Secret Sharing for the initial distributed key generation (DKG). The two-round signing protocol consists of a commitment round, which can be a pre-computation step, and a signing round.

**Key Design Steps and Security Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** A one-time, multi-round process where `n` participants collaboratively create a shared public key and each obtains a secret key share. No single participant knows the full private key.

*   **Two-Round Signing Protocol:**
    1.  **Round 1 (Commitment):** The `t` participating signers each generate a secret nonce and broadcast a public commitment to it. This round can be performed before the message is known. Using deterministic nonce generation (e.g., derived from the key share and message or a session ID) is crucial to prevent nonce reuse vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Round 2 (Signing):** Once the message is known, a coordinator sends it to the participants. Each participant then computes a partial signature using their secret share and nonce. The coordinator aggregates at least `t` of these partial signatures to form the final signature.

**Achieving Tight Security:**

*   **Provable Security:** The scheme must have a formal security proof, often in the Random Oracle Model, based on a hard problem like the Discrete Logarithm or Learning with Errors (for post-quantum security).
*   **Protection Against Malicious Insiders:** The protocol must be secure against an adversary who controls up to `t-1` participants. Techniques like verifiable secret sharing in the DKG and zero-knowledge proofs can be used to ensure participants behave honestly.
*   **Identifiable Aborts:** If a party misbehaves during the signing protocol (e.g., provides an invalid partial signature), the protocol should allow for the identification of the malicious party.
*   **Side-Channel Resistance:** All operations involving secret data must be implemented in constant time to prevent timing attacks.
*   **Stateless and Deterministic Design:** To avoid catastrophic failures from nonce reuse, especially in concurrent environments, a deterministic and stateless design, where nonces are derived rather than randomly generated and stored, is highly recommended. Schemes like Arctic provide a good model for this.

A well-known example that embodies many of these principles is **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)**, which is a two-round Schnorr-based threshold signature scheme. For post-quantum security, lattice-based schemes like Ringtail are being developed with similar two-round structures.
