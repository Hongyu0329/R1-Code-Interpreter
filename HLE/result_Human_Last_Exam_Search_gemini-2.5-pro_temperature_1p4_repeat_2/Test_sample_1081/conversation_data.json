    "The problem asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nLet $G$ be a reductive group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the Frobenius endomorphism associated with this $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are the maximal tori of $G$ that are stable under the action of $F$. The $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\nAn $F$-conjugacy class is an equivalence class in $W$ under the relation $w' \\sim w$ if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w' = x w F(x)^{-1}$. The action of $F$ on $W$ is induced by the action of the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q/\\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the root system, which in turn corresponds to automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram.\n\nThe prompt does not specify whether the group $G$ is split or of a twisted (non-split) form. The number of such tori depends on this information. Let's analyze the possible cases.\n\n### Case 1: $G$ is a split group (Chevalley group)\n\nFor a split group of type $E_8$, denoted $E_8(q)$, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. This means $F(x) = x$ for all $x \\in W$. The $F$-conjugacy relation simplifies to $w' = x w x^{-1}$, which is the standard definition of conjugacy in a group.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is known to be 112. This is a well-established result in the theory of reflection groups.\n\n### Case 2: $G$ is a twisted group (Steinberg group)\n\nTwisted forms of a simple algebraic group are associated with automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, as its symmetry group is trivial. This implies that there are no twisted forms of $E_8$ arising from graph automorphisms.\n\nTherefore, any group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is of the split Chevalley type. This means there is only one form of the group of type $E_8$ to consider over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be the split Chevalley group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. Consequently, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori up to conjugacy by elements of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is precisely the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
