    "**The largest French warship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the submarine *Doris*.**\n\nThe *Doris*, a *Circ√©*-class coastal submarine, was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-9 on the night of May 8-9, 1940. The sinking occurred in the North Sea, about 30 nautical miles off the Dutch coast.\n\nThe *Doris* had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons and a submerged displacement of 776 tons. At the time of its sinking, the submarine was operating under British command. The attack resulted in the loss of the entire crew.\n\nWhile other French warships were lost in the early stages of World War II, they were either sunk by other means, such as mines or air attacks, or were of a smaller displacement than the *Doris*. For instance, the destroyer *Bourrasque* was sunk by a mine on May 30, 1940. No records found indicate a larger French warship was sunk by a U-boat prior to the armistice on June 22, 1940.\n\n<<<*Doris*>>>"
