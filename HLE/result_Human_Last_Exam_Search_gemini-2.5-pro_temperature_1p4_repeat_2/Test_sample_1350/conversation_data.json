    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a member of the Wolfing kindred, a man who had been a captive of the Romans, who describes their religious practices in a way that alludes to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThis character, who is not given a specific name, recounts his time in a Roman city to his fellow Wolfings. He speaks of the Romans' claim to a she-wolf as their ancient helper and mother of their first king. This is a clear reference to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus, who were said to have been suckled by a she-wolf. The Wolfing man contrasts this with the Wolfings' own deep and authentic connection to the wolf as their totem, questioning the Romans' right to such a symbol.\n\n<<<A kinsman of the House of the Wolfings who was once a captive of the Romans.>>>"
