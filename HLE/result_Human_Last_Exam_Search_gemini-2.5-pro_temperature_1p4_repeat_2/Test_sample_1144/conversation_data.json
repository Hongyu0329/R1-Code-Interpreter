    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first determine the values for both quantities.\n\n**1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nWe are given that the uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) is 10 pm, which is equal to 10 x 10⁻¹² meters or 1 x 10⁻¹¹ meters. The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we can write the equation as:\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p):**\n\nThe angular momentum (L) of an electron in a Bohr orbit is quantized and is given by the formula L = nħ, where 'n' is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, n=1, so the angular momentum is L = ħ.\n\nThe angular momentum can also be expressed as L = p * r, where 'p' is the linear momentum and 'r' is the radius of the orbit. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n\nTherefore, we have:\np * a₀ = ħ\np = ħ / a₀\n\nThe value of the Bohr radius (a₀) is approximately 5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ meters.\n\nNow, we can calculate the momentum:\np = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Ratio of Uncertainty of Momentum to Momentum (Δp / p):**\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio:\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\nRatio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\nRatio = (5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\nRatio = 5.292 / 2\nRatio = 2.646\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
