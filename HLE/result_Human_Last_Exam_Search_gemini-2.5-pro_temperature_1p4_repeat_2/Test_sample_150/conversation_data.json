    "The provided Java program does not correctly solve the problem.\n\nThe program checks for an increment operation using `test.contains(\"++X\")` and a decrement operation using `test.contains(\"--X\")`. However, the problem states that the operation and the variable can be written in any order. This means that the statements `X++` and `X--` are also valid inputs. The Java code fails to handle these two cases, as `test.contains(\"++X\")` will be false for the input \"X++\", and `test.contains(\"--X\")` will be false for \"X--\". Consequently, the program produces an incorrect result for any input containing these statements.\n\nHere is a C program that correctly solves the problem with the highest efficiency in terms of speed (character comparisons) and memory usage.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the Bit++ problem with maximum efficiency.\n * It reads the number of statements, n, and then iterates n times.\n *\n * Efficiency Strategy:\n * 1. Speed (Character Comparisons):\n *    Instead of reading the whole 3-character string (e.g., \"X++\", \"++X\")\n *    and comparing strings, we can make a key observation: the character\n *    at the second position (index 1) uniquely identifies the operation.\n *    - For \"++X\" and \"X++\", the middle character is '+'.\n *    - For \"--X\" and \"X--\", the middle character is '-'.\n *    This requires reading only one specific character and performing a single\n *    comparison per statement, making it the fastest possible approach.\n *\n * 2. Memory Usage:\n *    To minimize memory, the program avoids storing the entire statement string in\n *    an array. It uses getchar() to read characters one by one from the input stream\n *    and only processes the character needed. Furthermore, the variables are declared\n *    using the smallest standard C data types that can hold the required range of values\n *    based on the problem constraints (1 <= n <= 150).\n *    - 'n' (statement count, 1 to 150): Fits in an `unsigned char` (1 byte).\n *    - 'x' (final value, -150 to 150): Fits in a `short int` (2 bytes).\n *    This results in a minimal memory footprint for the program's variables.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Use `unsigned char` (1 byte) for n, as its value is between 1 and 150.\n    unsigned char n;\n    scanf(\"%hhu\", &n);\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer by scanf.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Use `short int` (2 bytes) for x, as its final value is between -150 and 150.\n    short int x = 0;\n\n    // Loop n times. Using n as a countdown variable avoids a separate loop counter.\n    while (n-- > 0) {\n        // Read and discard the first character of the statement.\n        getchar();\n        \n        // Read the second character and check if it's '+'. This single check\n        // is sufficient to determine the operation.\n        if (getchar() == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n\n        // Read and discard the rest of the line (the third character\n        // of the statement and the newline character).\n        getchar();\n        getchar();\n    }\n\n    // Print the final value of x using the format specifier for a short integer.\n    printf(\"%hd\\n\", x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe most efficient solution performs exactly **one character comparison** for each of the 100 input instructions. This gives `x = 100`.\n\nThe minimal memory size is achieved by using the smallest possible standard data types for the variables `n` and `x`. An `unsigned char` for `n` uses 1 byte, and a `short int` for `x` uses 2 bytes. This totals **3 bytes**. This gives `y = 3`.\n\n<<<N100+3>>>"
