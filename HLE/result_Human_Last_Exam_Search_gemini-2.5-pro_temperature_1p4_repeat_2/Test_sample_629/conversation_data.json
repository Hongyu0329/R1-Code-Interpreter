    "The minimal grid number required to represent a trefoil knot is 5. This means the knot is drawn on a 5x5 grid. The grid number is the minimal number of vertical or horizontal segments needed, which is equivalent to the arc index of the knot.\n\nFor grid diagrams with a grid number of 5, there are a total of 10 distinct diagrams that form the trefoil knot. These 10 diagrams account for both the left-handed and right-handed versions of the knot.\n\nDue to the symmetry between a knot and its mirror image (chirality), the number of distinct grid diagrams is the same for both the left-hand and right-hand trefoil. Therefore, the 10 total minimal grid diagrams are split evenly between the two chiralities.\n\nThis results in 5 unique grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
