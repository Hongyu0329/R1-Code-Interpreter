    "I have gathered some initial definitions. A finite ultrametric space is a finite set with a distance function satisfying the strong triangle inequality: d(x, z) â‰¤ max(d(x, y), d(y, z)). A Banach space is a complete normed vector space. An isometric embedding of a metric space X into a metric space Y is a function f: X -> Y such that the distances are preserved.\n\nThe initial search also provided a very relevant paper titled \"Isometric embedding of finite ultrametric spaces in Banach spaces\" and a result stating that for any finite ultrametric space M and any infinite-dimensional Banach space B, there exists an isometric embedding of M into B. This suggests that the number of embeddings is at least one, given an infinite-dimensional Banach space. However, the question is about the *smallest possible* number of such embeddings, and also considers Banach spaces of any cardinality K, which could be finite-dimensional. I need to investigate further the case of finite-dimensional Banach spaces and what is known about the number of possible isometric embeddings, not just their existence. The cardinality K of the Banach space might be a crucial factor.I have gathered more specific information regarding isometric embeddings of ultrametric spaces into Banach spaces. It's clear that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded in some Banach space, even a Hilbert space. Some papers mention that a finite ultrametric space on n points can be embedded in l_p^(n-1). However, the question is about the *smallest possible number* of such embeddings, which hasn't been directly addressed. The concept of the isometry group of an ultrametric space seems relevant, as it describes the symmetries of the space, which could relate to the number of distinct embeddings. The cardinality of the Banach space B is also a key factor. For instance, if B is a single point, no embedding is possible for an ultrametric space with more than one point. If B has a small cardinality, there might be constraints on the existence of even one embedding. I need to specifically look for results that count or give bounds on the number of isometric embeddings. The uniqueness or non-uniqueness of these embeddings is central to the question.I have gathered some important information. The existence of at least one isometric embedding of a finite ultrametric space into an infinite-dimensional Banach space is known. Specifically, any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into a Hilbert space, and more generally into any infinite-dimensional Banach space.\n\nThe number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings is related to the isometry group of the ultrametric space and the structure of the target Banach space. If a Banach space is \"Urysohn universal,\" it has an extension property for isometries, which could imply multiple embeddings.\n\nHowever, the question is about the *smallest possible* number. This suggests I should consider Banach spaces that are \"minimal\" in some sense for a given ultrametric space. The cardinality of the Banach space B is a crucial parameter.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1.  **Existence:** For a given finite ultrametric space X, does an isometric embedding into a Banach space B of cardinality K always exist? If not, the number of embeddings is 0.\n2.  **Uniqueness:** If an embedding exists, is it unique up to an isometry of the Banach space? If f: X -> B is an embedding, and T: B -> B is an isometry, then T o f is also an embedding. We should probably count orbits of embeddings under the isometry group of B.\n3.  **Dependence on K:** How does the answer depend on K, the cardinality of the Banach space B?\n\nI need to synthesize the information to answer for different scenarios based on the properties of X and B (especially its cardinality and dimension). I will now proceed to construct the final answer based on the information gathered.\n\nHere's an analysis of the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$. The answer depends critically on the properties of both $X$ and $B$, particularly the cardinality and dimension of $B$ in relation to the structure of $X$.\n\nLet $|X| = n$.\n\n### **Case 1: The number of embeddings is 0**\n\nIt is possible for there to be **zero** isometric embeddings. This occurs if the Banach space $B$ is not \"large\" enough to accommodate the metric structure of $X$.\n\n*   **Trivial Case:** If $X$ has more than one point and $B$ consists of a single point (so $K=1$), no isometric embedding is possible.\n*   **Dimensionality Constraint:** A finite ultrametric space with $n$ points can be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ (with the standard Euclidean norm). However, an ultrametric space with $n$ points cannot always be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ if $d < n-1$. Therefore, if $B$ is a Banach space of dimension less than what is required to embed $X$, there might be no isometric embeddings. For instance, an ultrametric space with 4 points forming a star graph with edge lengths 1 cannot be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. If $B$ were a 2-dimensional Banach space, the number of embeddings could be 0.\n\n### **Case 2: The number of embeddings is 1 (up to isometries of B)**\n\nIn many scenarios, particularly when the Banach space is \"rich\" enough, at least one isometric embedding exists. The question of uniqueness is more subtle. We consider two embeddings $f_1, f_2: X \\to B$ to be equivalent if there exists an isometry $T$ of $B$ such that $f_2 = T \\circ f_1$.\n\nThe smallest non-zero number of equivalence classes of isometric embeddings is **one**.\n\nThis can happen if:\n\n*   **The structure of X is rigid:** If the isometry group of $X$ is trivial (only the identity map preserves distances), and the Banach space $B$ has a structure that does not allow for multiple, non-equivalent placements of the image of $X$.\n*   **Universal Embedding Properties:** For certain \"universal\" Banach spaces, there might be a canonical, unique (up to isometry) way to embed a given metric space. The Urysohn universal space, while not a Banach space, has this property, and similar concepts exist in Banach space theory.\n\nA key result by Shkarin shows that every finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into any infinite-dimensional Banach space. This guarantees at least one embedding in the infinite-dimensional case. The uniqueness, however, is not guaranteed in general.\n\n### **Case 3: The number of embeddings can be arbitrarily large or infinite**\n\nIn general, there can be multiple, non-equivalent isometric embeddings.\n\n*   **Symmetries of the Banach Space:** If the Banach space $B$ has a large isometry group, it can lead to multiple non-equivalent embeddings. For example, if $B$ is a Hilbert space, which is highly symmetric, there can be many ways to isometrically embed $X$.\n*   **The Isometry Group of X:** If $X$ itself has non-trivial isometries, this can lead to different embeddings. Let $\\text{Iso}(X)$ be the isometry group of $X$. If $g \\in \\text{Iso}(X)$ and $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding, then $f \\circ g$ is also a set of points in $B$ that is isometric to $X$, but the mapping from the specific points of $X$ is different.\n\n### **Summary of Possibilities for the Smallest Number:**\n\nTo find the *smallest possible number*, we should consider the most constrained, yet still possible, scenarios.\n\n1.  **If an embedding is not guaranteed:** The smallest number is **0**. This happens if the Banach space $B$ is not sufficiently large or does not have the right geometric properties to contain an isometric copy of $X$. For instance, if the cardinality $K$ implies a dimension that is too small for $X$.\n\n2.  **If an embedding is guaranteed:** In cases where an embedding must exist (e.g., if $B$ is an infinite-dimensional Banach space), the smallest possible number of *non-equivalent* embeddings is **1**. While it's difficult to construct a general scenario where uniqueness is guaranteed for any finite ultrametric space $X$ and any suitable Banach space $B$, it remains the theoretical minimum if the number is not zero.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings can be either 0 or 1, depending on the relationship between the finite ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$. Without further constraints on $X$ and $B$, a more precise single number cannot be given.\n\nLet's refine the final answer based on the most reasonable interpretation of the question. The question asks for the \"smallest possible number\", which usually implies finding a minimum value across all possible valid configurations of $X$ and $B$.\n\n*   If we can choose any $X$ and any $B$ (of cardinality K), then we can easily construct a case where the number of embeddings is 0 (e.g., $|X| = 2$, $B$ is a single point).\n\n*   If we assume that an embedding is possible, the minimal number of such embeddings (up to isometries of the target space) would be 1.\n\nGiven the phrasing, the most direct and encompassing answer is that the number can be zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
