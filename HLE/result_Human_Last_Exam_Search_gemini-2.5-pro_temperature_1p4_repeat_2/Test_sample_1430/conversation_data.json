    "Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, X = Sym¹⁵(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted ρ(X), depends on the specific choice of the curve C. There is a known formula relating the Picard number of a symmetric power of a curve to the Picard number of its Jacobian variety. For a curve C of genus g and an integer n ≥ g, the formula is:\n\nρ(Symⁿ(C)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1\n\nHere, n=15 and g=3, so the condition n ≥ g is satisfied. Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian variety of a genus 3 curve, ρ(Jac(C)).\n\nThe Jacobian of a curve of genus g, Jac(C), is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension g. The rank of its Néron-Severi group, ρ(Jac(C)), is bounded by the Hodge number h¹¹(Jac(C)). For an abelian variety of dimension g, h¹¹ is equal to g². In our case, g=3, so we have:\n\n1 ≤ ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3² = 9\n\n**Smallest Rank:**\nFor a *very general* curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian variety Jac(C) is simple and its ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, End(Jac(C)) = ℤ. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is the minimum possible value. Thus, for a general curve C:\n\nρ(Jac(C)) = 1\n\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for ρ(X):\n\nSmallest ρ(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Largest Rank:**\nThe maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of a variety is the Hodge number h¹¹, which is 9 for a 3-dimensional abelian variety. This maximum is achieved for abelian varieties of CM (Complex Multiplication) type. For such varieties, all Hodge classes are algebraic, leading to ρ = h¹¹.\n\nA curve C whose Jacobian Jac(C) is of CM type will yield the maximum rank. While a simple abelian threefold that is a Jacobian cannot be of CM type, a non-simple Jacobian can be. The classic example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0. This is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is of CM type, and it is isogenous to the product of three identical elliptic curves with complex multiplication. For the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic, the Picard number is maximal. Therefore, there exists a curve C for which:\n\nρ(Jac(C)) = 9\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for ρ(X):\n\nLargest ρ(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
