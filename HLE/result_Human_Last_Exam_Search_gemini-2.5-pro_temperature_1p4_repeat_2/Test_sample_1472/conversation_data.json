    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The two most common forms are the copper(I) and copper(II) complexes, which exhibit different molecular geometries and therefore belong to different point groups.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\n\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex, [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂]⁺, has a symmetry point group of **S₄**. In this complex, the copper(I) ion is coordinated by four sulfur atoms from the two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands. The arrangement is described as a distorted tetrahedron. The cation possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄), which involves a 90° rotation followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\n\nIn the case of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, such as [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂](BF₄)₂, the coordination geometry is a distorted octahedron. The copper(II) ion is bonded to the four sulfur atoms of the two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands in the equatorial plane and to two fluorine atoms from the tetrafluoroborate counter-ions in the axial positions. The crystal structure of this complex is monoclinic with the space group P2₁/c, which implies the presence of a center of inversion in the unit cell. The point group of the isolated [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂F₂] entity is likely to be **C₂h** or a lower symmetry group, which is common for such distorted octahedral complexes.\n\nIn summary, the point group is **S₄** for the copper(I) complex and a lower symmetry, likely **C₂h**, for the distorted octahedral copper(II) complex.\n\n<<<S₄ for the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex and likely C₂h for the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex.>>>"
