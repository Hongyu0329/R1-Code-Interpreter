    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first determine the number of functions for each type of atom and then sum them for the entire molecule.\n\n### Analysis of the 6-31G Basis Set\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" specifies how the atomic orbitals are represented:\n\n*   **For second-row atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   The **'6'** indicates that each core (1s) atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   The **'31'** indicates that the valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is split into two parts (a split-valence double-zeta basis set).\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell is described by one contracted function per orbital (one 2s and three 2p), each made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The outer part of the valence shell is described by one contracted function per orbital (one 2s and three 2p), each represented by a single primitive Gaussian.\n\nTherefore, for each Carbon atom, the number of contracted functions is:\n*   1s (core): 1 function\n*   2s and 2p (inner valence): 1 s-function + 3 p-functions = 4 functions\n*   2s and 2p (outer valence): 1 s-function + 3 p-functions = 4 functions\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 functions.**\n\n*   **For the Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s valence orbital is also split according to the '31G' scheme.\n        *   Inner part: A contracted function from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   Outer part: A single primitive Gaussian function.\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 functions.**\n\n### Calculation for Toluene (C7H8)\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   Total functions from Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   Total functions from Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Total contracted functions = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79 functions.**\n\nA calculation on methanol (CH3OH) confirms this method: 1 Carbon (9), 1 Oxygen (9), and 4 Hydrogens (4 x 2 = 8) result in a total of 26 basis functions, which is a referenced value.\n\n<<<79>>>"
