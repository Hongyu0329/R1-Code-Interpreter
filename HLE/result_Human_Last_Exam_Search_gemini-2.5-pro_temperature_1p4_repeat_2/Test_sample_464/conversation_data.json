    "Yes, if $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz class function such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$, it does follow that $f$ is identically zero.\n\nHere is the step-by-step argument:\n\n### 1. The Fourier Transform\n\nThe main tool to solve this problem is the Fourier transform. Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, defined as:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx\n$$\nA crucial property of the Schwartz space is that the Fourier transform maps the space onto itself; if $f$ is a Schwartz function, then $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function. This means $\\hat{f}$ is also infinitely differentiable and, along with all its derivatives, decays rapidly at infinity.\n\n### 2. Linking Moments of $f(x)$ to Derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$\n\nWe can compute the derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. Because $f$ is a Schwartz function, we can differentiate under the integral sign:\n$$\n\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) \\,dx\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at $\\xi=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx\n$$\nThis formula provides the key connection: the derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are directly proportional to the moments of the original function.\n\n### 3. Applying the Given Condition\n\nThe problem states that all the moments of $f$ are zero:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, ...\n$$\nUsing the relationship from the previous step, this directly implies that all the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are also zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, ...\n$$\n\n### 4. Uniqueness from Zero Derivatives\n\nSince $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is a $C^\\infty$ (infinitely differentiable) function. Consider the Taylor series of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around the point $\\xi=0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k\n$$\nSince every derivative $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$ is zero, this Taylor series is identically zero.\n\nFor a general $C^\\infty$ function, this would not be enough to conclude the function is zero. However, functions in the Schwartz space are not just smooth; they are exceptionally well-behaved. One can show that a Schwartz function is analytic on the real line. An analytic function that has all its derivatives equal to zero at a single point must be identically zero over its entire domain. Therefore, we can conclude:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\n### 5. Invertibility of the Fourier Transform\n\nThe Fourier transform is an isomorphism (a one-to-one and onto linear map) on the Schwartz space. This means it has a well-defined inverse. If the Fourier transform of a function is the zero function, then the function itself must be the zero function.\n$$\n\\text{If } \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0, \\text{ then } f(x) = 0 \\text{ for all } x.\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\n**Important Note:** The condition that $f$ is a Schwartz function is critical. There exist non-zero functions that are not in the Schwartz space but have all their moments equal to zero. A classic counterexample is related to the log-normal distribution density.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
