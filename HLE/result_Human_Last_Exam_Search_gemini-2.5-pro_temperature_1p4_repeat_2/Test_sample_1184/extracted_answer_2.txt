The hotspots for interaction between the human voltage-gated calcium channel beta-1 subunit and the alpha-1 subunit are primarily located in the **AID-binding pocket (ABP)** within the **Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain**. Key residues involved are conserved hydrophobic and charged amino acids, including specific **Methionine and Leucine** residues that form a groove to accommodate the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID). The exact residues involved in fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit are more dispersed and include: two lysine residues (**K3 and K4**) in the **N-terminus**, and charged residues within the **acidic and basic subdomains of the HOOK region**. The **GK domain** as a whole is also crucial for gating modulation.
