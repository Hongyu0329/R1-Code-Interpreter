    "To determine the maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph, we need to consider the relationship between the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, and the maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$.\n\nA fundamental result in graph theory is that for any graph $G$, the chromatic number is at most one more than its maximum degree, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nBrooks' Theorem provides a more specific bound, stating that for a connected graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$ unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the case of a complete graph ($K_n$) or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is exactly $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nThe problem states that $G$ is not a complete graph. However, $G$ could be a disconnected graph. If a graph is disconnected, its chromatic number is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n\nTo find the maximum number of colors required, we should construct a graph that fits the criteria and has the highest possible chromatic number. Let's consider a graph $G$ that is disconnected and has two components:\n1.  A complete graph with $k$ vertices, denoted $K_k$.\n2.  A graph consisting of the remaining $12345 - k$ vertices as isolated points.\n\nThis graph $G$ is not a complete graph as long as $k < 12345$, because it is disconnected. Let's analyze its properties:\n*   **Number of vertices**: The total number of vertices is $k + (12345 - k) = 12345$.\n*   **Maximum Degree $\\Delta(G)$**: The degree of any vertex in the $K_k$ component is $k-1$. The degree of any isolated vertex is 0. Therefore, the maximum degree of $G$ is $\\Delta(G) = k-1$.\n*   **Chromatic Number $\\chi(G)$**: The chromatic number of $K_k$ is $k$. The chromatic number for the isolated vertices is 1. The chromatic number of the entire graph $G$ is the maximum of its components' chromatic numbers, so $\\chi(G) = \\max(k, 1) = k$.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of colors, which is $\\chi(G) = k$. The problem specifies that the graph $G$ cannot be the complete graph on 12345 vertices. This means we cannot choose $k = 12345$. The next largest possible integer value for $k$ is 12344.\n\nLet's set $k=12344$. Our graph $G$ consists of a complete graph $K_{12344}$ and a single isolated vertex.\n*   The total number of vertices is $12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n*   The graph is not a complete graph.\n*   The maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12344 - 1 = 12343$.\n*   The number of colors needed is $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n\nIn this case, $\\chi(G) = 12344$, which is equal to $\\Delta(G) + 1 = 12343 + 1$. This scenario demonstrates that a graph on 12345 vertices which is not a complete graph can require 12344 colors. It is not possible to require more, as the only graph with 12345 vertices that requires 12345 colors is the complete graph $K_{12345}$, which is explicitly excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
