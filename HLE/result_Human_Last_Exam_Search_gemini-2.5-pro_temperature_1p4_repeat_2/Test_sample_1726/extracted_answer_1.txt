1. **The Relativity of Simultaneity**: Yes, this would still be true.
2. **Relativity of Lengths**: Yes, this would still be true.
3. **Relativity of Time**: Yes, this would still be true.
4. **Invariance of the Speed of Light**: No, this would not be true.
5. **Non-Newtonian Addition of Speeds**: Yes, this would still be true.
6. **Formula for Relativity of Lengths**: $L = L_0 / \sqrt{1 + (v/c)^2}$
7. **Formula for Relativity of Time**: $\Delta t = \Delta t_0 / \sqrt{1 + (v/c)^2}$
8. **Formula for Addition of Speeds**: $u = (u' + v) / (1 - u'v/c^2)$
