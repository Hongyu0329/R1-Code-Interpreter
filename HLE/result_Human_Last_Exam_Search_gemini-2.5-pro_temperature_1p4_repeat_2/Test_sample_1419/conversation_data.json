    "### Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling in ϕ⁴ Theory Emerges from Epsilon Expansion\n\nIn the study of critical phenomena, the ϕ⁴ theory near four spatial dimensions provides a foundational model for understanding universal behavior. The leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, can be determined using the epsilon expansion, a technique pioneered by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the one-loop beta function for the renormalized coupling constant, u, in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions. The beta function describes how the coupling strength changes with the energy scale. To the leading order in both the coupling and ϵ, the beta function is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u²\n\nA fixed point of the renormalization group flow is a value of the coupling, u*, where the beta function vanishes, i.e., β(u*) = 0. At a fixed point, the theory becomes scale-invariant. Setting the beta function to zero yields two solutions:\n\n-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0\n\nOne solution is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, where u* = 0. The other, more interesting solution, is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Assuming u* is non-zero, we can divide by u* to find:\n\nϵ = (3 / (16π²))u*\n\nSolving for the fixed point coupling u* gives the leading order expression in terms of ϵ:\n\nu* = (16π²/3)ϵ\n\nThis result is fundamental to the theory of critical phenomena, as it allows for the calculation of critical exponents as an expansion in ϵ. These exponents characterize the universal behavior of a wide range of physical systems near their critical points.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ϵ>>>"
