    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the absence of a rake significantly widens the profitable pre-flop opening ranges, especially from the button. In such an environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is slightly diminished in favor of playing more hands in position post-flop, as the pot odds are more favorable without a house cut.\n\nStandard pre-flop opening charts for raked games often suggest opening suited jacks from the button down to J6s or J5s. For instance, some baseline strategies recommend a button opening range that includes J6s and stronger suited jacks. More detailed GTO (Game Theory Optimal) charts for raked games might include hands as weak as J5s as a standard open from the button.\n\nHowever, in a rake-free game, GTO solvers will advocate for opening a wider range of hands. This is because even marginally profitable hands become more appealing to play when you don't have to overcome the rake. While direct access to a comprehensive GTO chart for a 100BB rake-free game is not available through the search, the consensus among poker theory resources is that ranges should be looser. Some sources even mention hands like J4s as being part of a button's opening range, particularly in specific sizing strategies for raked games, which implies they are on the cusp of playability.\n\nGiven that a rake-free environment makes it correct to open a wider array of hands from the button to leverage the positional advantage, it is logical to conclude that the range of playable suited jacks extends beyond what is standard in a raked game. Therefore, the weakest suited jacks, which might be marginal folds in a raked game, become profitable opens. This means the range of suited jacks to open from the button expands to include J4s, J3s, and even J2s. Since the question asks for the *worst* suited jack you *should* open, this would be the one with the lowest kicker that is still considered a profitable raise. In a GTO-approved, rake-free scenario, this is the lowest possible suited jack.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
