    "The haiku describes a powerful and transformative event, a \"tempest\" that brings about significant \"winds of change\" where a \"divine one yields.\" The date is indicated as \"Twice fifteen,\" or the 30th of August. While there are several historical events that occurred on August 30th which could fit this description, the key to solving the riddle lies in the title itself.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is presented as a question. The letters that constitute the word \"Bays\" are B, A, Y, and S. The instruction specifies that the answer must be in alphabetical order. When these letters are arranged alphabetically, they form the word \"ABSY.\" This word is a recognized variant spelling of \"abyss,\" a concept that thematically aligns with the turbulent and profound nature of the events described in the haiku.\n\n<<<ABSY>>>"
