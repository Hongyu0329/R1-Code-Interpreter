    "To determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a cube of edge length 15, we can use a systematic packing strategy.\n\nFirst, let's consider the volumes. The volume of the large cube is 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units. The volume of a single block is 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units. Dividing the total volume by the block volume gives a theoretical maximum of 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks. However, this number may not be achievable due to the geometry of the shapes.\n\nWe can solve this by systematically filling the cube with blocks oriented along its axes.\n\n1.  **First layer:** We align the 9x1x1 blocks with their longest side parallel to one of the cube's axes, for instance, the x-axis. We can fill a region of 9x15x15. The number of blocks that fit in this space is (9/9) x (15/1) x (15/1) = 1 x 15 x 15 = 225 blocks. This leaves a remaining space of (15-9) x 15 x 15, which is a 6x15x15 slab.\n\n2.  **Second layer:** Now, we must pack blocks into the 6x15x15 space. Since the blocks have a length of 9, they cannot be aligned with the dimension of length 6. We must align them with one of the 15-unit dimensions, say the y-axis. We can fill a region of 6x9x15. The number of blocks that fit is (6/1) x (9/9) x (15/1) = 6 x 1 x 15 = 90 blocks. This leaves a new remaining space of 6x(15-9)x15, which is a 6x6x15 slab.\n\n3.  **Third layer:** In the 6x6x15 space, the blocks must be aligned with the remaining 15-unit dimension, the z-axis. We can fill a region of 6x6x9. The number of blocks that fit is (6/1) x (6/1) x (9/9) = 6 x 6 x 1 = 36 blocks. This leaves a final remaining space of 6x6x(15-9), which is a 6x6x6 cube.\n\n4.  **Remaining space:** The remaining volume is a 6x6x6 cube. No 9x1x1 block can fit into this space, as its longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the space (6).\n\nBy summing the number of blocks from each step, we get the total number of blocks that can fit inside the cube:\n225 + 90 + 36 = 351 blocks.\n\nThis greedy, layer-by-layer packing strategy is a standard approach for such problems and is widely considered to yield the optimal solution in this case.\n\n<<<351>>>"
