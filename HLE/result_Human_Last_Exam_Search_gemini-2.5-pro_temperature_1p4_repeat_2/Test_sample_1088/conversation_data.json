    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atoms present in the molecule. The notation \"6-311G**\" describes how many primitive Gaussians are used to build the basis functions for each atom.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what the notation signifies:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This indicates a Pople-style, split-valence triple-zeta basis set.\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals of each heavy (non-hydrogen) atom are described by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are described by three contracted functions. For heavy atoms, this applies to the s and p valence orbitals. For hydrogen, it applies to the 1s orbital.\n        *   The first function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The second function is a single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   The third function is another single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   **G**: This simply indicates that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n\n*   **\\*\\***: The two asterisks represent the addition of polarization functions to improve the description of chemical bonding. This is also commonly denoted as 6-311G(d,p).\n    *   The first **\\*** adds a set of d-type polarization functions to each heavy atom. In most modern quantum chemistry programs, this consists of 5 \"pure\" d-functions (d<sub>z²</sub>, d<sub>x²-y²</sub>, d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>), which are all derived from a single primitive d-type Gaussian. However, some programs may use 6 Cartesian d-functions by default for this notation.\n    *   The second **\\*** adds a set of p-type polarization functions (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>) to each hydrogen atom. These three functions are built from a single primitive p-type Gaussian.\n\n### Calculation for Specific Atoms:\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you must sum the number for each of its atoms. Here are the calculations for hydrogen and carbon:\n\n**For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   **Valence (1s) orbital**: It is a valence-only atom, so the \"311\" rule applies, meaning 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization (p-functions)**: The second asterisk `*` adds one set of p-functions. Since the three p-orbitals (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>) are constructed from a single radial Gaussian function, this adds 1 primitive p-type Gaussian.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (for s) + 1 (for p) = 6 primitive Gaussians.\n\n**For a Carbon (C) atom (a second-row \"heavy\" atom):**\n*   **Core (1s) orbital**: The `6` in the name indicates this is composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p) orbitals**: The `311` rule applies to the valence shell. In Pople-style basis sets, the same set of primitive Gaussians is used for both the s and p valence orbitals (these are called sp functions). Therefore, there is one set of valence primitives: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization (d-functions)**: The first asterisk `*` adds one set of d-functions, which corresponds to 1 primitive d-type Gaussian.\n*   **Total for Carbon**: 6 (for core) + 5 (for valence sp) + 1 (for d) = 12 primitive Gaussians.\n\n### Example: Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)\n\nTo calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for methane with the 6-311G** basis set:\n*   1 Carbon atom: 12 primitive Gaussians\n*   4 Hydrogen atoms: 4 * 6 = 24 primitive Gaussians\n*   **Total for CH<sub>4</sub>**: 12 + 24 = 36 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom. For Hydrogen, it is 6. For a second-row heavy atom like Carbon, it is 12. The total for a molecule is the sum of the primitives for each of its atoms.>>>"
