    "Adult Raphidopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predatory insects. Their diet consists mainly of soft-bodied arthropods, with a particular preference for aphids.\n\nIn addition to preying on insects, some adult snakeflies have been recorded feeding on pollen, and pollen has been found in their digestive tracts. Some species also consume other sugary substances, which can include nectar. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that adult snakeflies feed on fungus or leaf tissue.\n\nBased on the provided choices:\n*   **A. Nectar:** This is a recorded food source.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** As snakeflies are significant predators of aphids, this is a valid food source.\n\nTherefore, Raphidopterans have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
