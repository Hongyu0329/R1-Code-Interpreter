    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Athos**.\n\nMount Olympus, the mythical dwelling of the gods, stands as the highest peak in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet). Several other earthly mountains feature in Homer's epic poem, serving as settings for divine observation and mortal endeavors.\n\nThe most prominent of these, after Olympus, is Mount Athos. Located on the Chalcidice Peninsula in northeastern Greece, it has a height of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). Homer makes a reference to Mount Athos in the *Iliad*.\n\nAnother significant mountain in the epic is Mount Ida, situated in modern-day Turkey near the ancient city of Troy. It was from the peaks of Mount Ida that the gods were said to have watched the Trojan War. The highest peak of this Mount Ida (also known as Kaz Dağı) is approximately 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). It is important to distinguish this from another Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which is taller but not the one featured in the Trojan War narrative.\n\nLastly, Mount Pelion in Thessaly, Greece, is also mentioned in the *Iliad*, notably as the source of the wood for Achilles' spear. Its highest peak, Pourianos Stavros, reaches an elevation of 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n\nComparing the elevations of these historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, Mount Athos is the tallest among them, second only to the supernal Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
