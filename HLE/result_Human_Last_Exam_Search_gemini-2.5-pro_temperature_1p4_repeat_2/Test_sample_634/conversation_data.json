    "The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, is another polynomial matrix, G, that is a right divisor of both P1 and P2. Furthermore, any other common right divisor of P1 and P2 must also be a left divisor of G. The GCRD is unique up to pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\nTo find the GCRD of the given matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nOne common method is to use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves creating a stacked matrix by combining P1 and P2 and then using elementary row operations to reduce it to a simpler form. The elementary row operations are equivalent to pre-multiplying by unimodular matrices.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Form the compound matrix M by stacking P1 on top of P2:\n    M = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n         [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n         [s, 0],\n         [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  Perform a series of elementary row operations to reduce this matrix. An elementary row operation can be one of the following:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n    The goal is to transform the matrix into the form [G, 0]^T, where G is the GCRD.\n\nThrough a sequence of such operations, the matrix M can be reduced to:\n    [,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ]\n\nThe non-zero part of the final matrix is the GCRD. In this case, the resulting GCRD is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nWhen the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the matrices are said to be \"right coprime\". This indicates that they share no common right divisors other than unimodular ones.\n\nAn alternative method to verify this result involves examining the determinants of the matrices and the minors of the stacked matrix. The determinant of the GCRD must divide the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the determinants of all possible maximal-rank minors of the stacked matrix. For this problem, this means the GCD of the determinants of all 2x2 submatrices.\n*   det(P1) = (s^2 + s)(s^2) - (-s)(-s^2 - 1) = s^4 + s^3 - s^3 - s = s^4 - s\n*   det(P2) = s*1 - 0*(-s - 1) = s\n*   The GCD of these determinants is gcd(s^4 - s, s) = s.\n\nCalculating the determinants of the other 2x2 minors and finding the GCD of all of them results in 1. Since the GCD of these determinants is 1, the matrices are right coprime, and their GCRD is a unimodular matrix, which can be represented by the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
