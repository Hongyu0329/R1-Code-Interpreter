    "The reaction described involves two key steps: a directed ortho-metalation followed by an electrophilic quench.\n\nFirst, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide is treated with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Both the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) are effective directing metalation groups (DMGs). The N,N-diethylcarboxamide is a particularly strong DMG.\n\nIn this molecule, the two directing groups are located at positions 1 and 3 of the benzene ring. They work in a cooperative fashion to direct the lithiation to the C2 position, which is ortho to both groups. The sec-BuLi, a powerful base, removes the proton from the C2 position. The TMEDA serves to chelate the lithium cation, which increases the basicity of the organolithium reagent and accelerates the rate of metalation. This forms a lithiated intermediate, N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nIn the second step, methyl iodide (CH₃I) is added to the reaction. The aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic methyl group of the methyl iodide. This results in the displacement of the iodide ion and the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond at the C2 position.\n\nTherefore, the final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
