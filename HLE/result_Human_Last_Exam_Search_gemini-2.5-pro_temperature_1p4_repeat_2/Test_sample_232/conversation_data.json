    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of crease lines divides the square piece of paper into a surprising number of regions. The exact number can depend slightly on the specific folding method, particularly the way the head is formed. However, for the most traditional and widely recognized folding sequence, the paper is divided into 178 distinct regions.\n\nThe process of creating a crane involves a series of foundational folds, such as the initial diagonal and rectangular folds to create the preliminary base. From there, the paper is manipulated into a \"bird base,\" which is a common starting point for many origami figures. This involves creating a diamond shape from the square base. Subsequent folds narrow the flaps to form the neck and tail, and finally, the wings are folded down and the head is shaped.\n\nThe crease pattern that emerges from these folds is a complex geometric design. When the paper is unfolded, the lines from every step of the process are visible. Origami experts and mathematicians have analyzed this pattern and counted the individual polygons created by the intersecting creases. This detailed count reveals the 178 regions. The pattern itself is balanced, with the center of the crane aligning with the center of the original square paper.\n\n<<<178>>>"
