    "To determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we first identify the space in question. The space of 3-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nA fundamental property of Grassmannians is the diffeomorphism $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cong G_{n-k}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. Therefore, the space $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We will proceed by analyzing the cohomology of $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nThe integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is a known result in algebraic topology. For the Grassmannian $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, the cohomology ring is generated by two characteristic classes: the Euler class $e$ of the tautological 2-plane bundle $\\gamma$ over $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, and the first Pontryagin class $p_1$ of the same bundle.\n\nThe structure of the cohomology ring $H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is given by:\n$H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}[e, p_1] / I$\nwhere $e$ is in dimension 2, $p_1$ is in dimension 4, and $I$ is the ideal of relations. The relations are:\n1. $e^3 = e p_1$\n2. $2e=0$\n3. $p_1^2 = 0$\n\nLet's analyze the additive structure of the cohomology groups in each degree. The dimension of the manifold $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n*   $H^0(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$: This group is generated by $e$. The relation $2e=0$ implies that $e$ is an element of order 2. Thus, $H^2(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $H^3(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^4(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$: This group contains the element $p_1$, which is of infinite order, and potentially products of lower degree classes like $e^2$. However, the relation $2e=0$ implies $2e^2=0$, making $e^2$ a torsion element. Therefore, $H^4(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by $p_1$ and $e^2$.\n*   $H^5(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$: This top cohomology group is generated by $ep_1$ (since $e^3=ep_1$). It turns out that this group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of these groups:\n$H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ in degrees 0, 2, 4, and 6 respectively, and is zero in other degrees.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of an abelian group is the subgroup consisting of all elements of finite order. In this case, the torsion subgroup is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group:\n$Tors(H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe question asks for the \"rank\" of this torsion subgroup. In the context of finitely generated abelian groups, the rank is the number of independent generators of infinite order (the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ summands in its decomposition). A torsion group, by definition, consists entirely of elements of finite order. Therefore, it has no elements of infinite order. Consequently, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
