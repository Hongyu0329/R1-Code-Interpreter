    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of aryl halides in Grignard reactions follows the order I > Br > Cl. Consequently, the iodine atom at the 2-position is the most reactive and will be replaced first by a phenyl group. Given the excess of the Grignard reagent and the forcing conditions (refluxing THF), the two less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 will also undergo substitution.\n\nThe step-by-step substitution is as follows:\n1.  1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene reacts with one equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  This intermediate then reacts with two more equivalents of phenyl magnesium bromide to replace the two bromine atoms, yielding the final product.\n\nThe aqueous work-up quenches any unreacted Grignard reagent. The final organic product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
