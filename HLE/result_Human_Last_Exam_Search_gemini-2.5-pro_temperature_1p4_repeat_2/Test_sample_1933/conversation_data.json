    "The VC dimension of a set of classifiers (a hypothesis space) is the maximum number of points that can be shattered by the set of classifiers. In this context, the classifiers are defined by formulas in a specific fragment of first-order logic, $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the classifiers. The classifiers are defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable, $x$. These formulas are constructed from the four unary atomic predicates, let's call them $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$, using only the logical connectives for conjunction ($\\land$), true ($\\top$), false ($\\bot$), and the existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language is logically equivalent to a formula of the form $C(x) \\land \\psi$, where $C(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$, and $\\psi$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). The sentence $\\psi$ is a conjunction of expressions of the form $\\exists y (\\dots)$, which are either true or false for a given model. Therefore, in any specific model, the formula $\\phi(x)$ simplifies to one of two forms:\n1.  $\\bot$ (the empty set), if the sentence part $\\psi$ is false.\n2.  A conjunction of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, if the sentence part $\\psi$ is true. This includes the formula $\\top$ (the entire universe) when the index set $I$ is empty.\n\nThe set of hypotheses, or definable sets, is therefore the collection of all possible intersections of the sets corresponding to the four predicates, along with the empty set and the total universe. This is equivalent to the set of all intersections of the base predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to determining the VC dimension of a hypothesis space formed by the intersections of 4 base sets. Let the four predicates correspond to four sets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$. The hypothesis space $\\mathcal{H}$ consists of sets of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ for all $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe VC dimension for such a system is known to be the number of base sets, which in this case is 4. Here's a justification:\n\n*   **VC dimension is at least 4**: We must show that a set of 4 points can be shattered. Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We can define the predicates (sets) $P_i$ as $P_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. To obtain any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can take the intersection of the predicates $\\{P_j \\mid x_j \\notin Y\\}$. This intersection will precisely yield the set $Y$. For example, to isolate $\\{x_1\\}$, we intersect $P_2$, $P_3$, and $P_4$. This works for all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$.\n\n*   **VC dimension is at most 4**: We must show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. Let $X$ be any set of 5 points. The total number of distinct classifiers that can be defined is limited by the number of possible intersections of the four predicates, which is at most $2^4 = 16$. To shatter a set of 5 points, one would need to be able to generate all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets. Since we only have at most 16 distinct classifiers, it is impossible to generate all 32 required subsets. Thus, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\nCombining these two points, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
