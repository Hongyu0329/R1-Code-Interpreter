    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Molecular Structure and Symmetry\n\nThe molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring. At positions 1, 3, and 5, it is substituted with identical groups: `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl`. This substitution pattern gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry, meaning that the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one of these arms and on the central ring and sum them up.\n\n### Analysis of Non-Equivalent Protons\n\nLet's break down the structure into its unique components:\n\n1.  **The Central Mesitylene Ring:**\n    *   The three methyl groups (`-CH3`) attached to the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These nine protons will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Total signals from this part: 1**\n\n2.  **The Methylene Linker (`-CH2-`):**\n    *   There are three methylene groups linking the central ring to the indazole substituents. These three groups are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, each methylene group is attached to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived indazole unit is chiral). This makes the two protons on a single methylene group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts, thus giving rise to two separate signals. These protons will likely appear as a pair of doublets due to coupling with each other.\n    *   **Total signals from this part: 2**\n\n3.  **The Camphor-Indazole Moiety:**\n    *   This part of the molecule, `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole`, is derived from camphor. It is a rigid, chiral, bicyclic system.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The camphor skeleton contains three methyl groups (`7,8,8-trimethyl`). Due to the rigid and asymmetric structure, these three methyl groups are in different chemical environments and are therefore non-equivalent. The 1H NMR spectrum of camphor itself shows three distinct signals for its methyl groups.\n        *   **3 signals**\n    *   **Indazole Ring Proton:** The indazole ring system contains one proton on its five-membered ring.\n        *   **1 signal**\n    *   **Camphor Skeleton Protons:** We must count the remaining protons on the saturated bicyclic framework (`tetrahydro-4,7-methano` part).\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is one proton at the C4 bridgehead position.\n            *   **1 signal**\n        *   **Methylene Protons:** There are two `CH2` groups on the six-membered ring of the skeleton (at positions C5 and C6). The two protons within each methylene group (exo and endo) are diastereotopic due to the rigid, chiral structure. Thus, each `CH2` group gives two signals.\n            *   C5-H₂: **2 signals**\n            *   C6-H₂: **2 signals**\n    *   **Total signals from this moiety: 3 (methyls) + 1 (indazole) + 1 (bridgehead) + 2 (CH₂) + 2 (CH₂) = 9**\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the signals from all the non-equivalent protons:\n\n*   Central Ring Methyls: 1 signal\n*   Methylene Linkers: 2 signals\n*   Camphor-Indazole Arm: 9 signals\n\nTotal number of peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectra of the given compound.\n\n<<<H>>>"
