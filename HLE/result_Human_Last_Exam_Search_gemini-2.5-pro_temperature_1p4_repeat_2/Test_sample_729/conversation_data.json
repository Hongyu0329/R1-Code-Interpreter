    "In the context of group theory, a \"power subgroup\" is most commonly understood to be a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element (which can be a power of another element). The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, has a specific structure that allows for a systematic counting of its cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe structure of Q_128 is given by the presentation ⟨x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹⟩. The subgroups of Q_128 can be categorized into two types: those that are contained within the cyclic subgroup generated by *x*, and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by powers of *x***: The element *x* generates a cyclic subgroup of order 64, denoted as ⟨x⟩. A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that for any cyclic group of order *n*, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of *n*. The number 64 has the divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Therefore, there are 7 cyclic subgroups contained within ⟨x⟩.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements involving *y***: The other elements of Q_128 are of the form *x*ⁱ*y*, where *i* can be any integer from 0 to 63. It can be shown that every element of this form has an order of 4. A cyclic subgroup generated by such an element is {1, *x*ⁱ*y*, *x*³², *x*⁽ⁱ⁺³²⁾*y*}. To find the number of unique subgroups of this type, we must account for the fact that different elements can generate the same subgroup. The elements *x*ⁱ*y* and *x*⁽ⁱ⁺³²⁾*y* generate the same subgroup. Since there are 64 elements of the form *x*ⁱ*y*, and each subgroup is generated by two of these elements, there are 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of this nature.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups of ⟨x⟩ because they contain elements involving *y*. The only potential for overlap is with subgroups of order 4, but the single cyclic subgroup of order 4 within ⟨x⟩, which is ⟨x¹⁶⟩, contains only powers of *x*.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct cyclic (power) subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is the sum of the counts from both categories: 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
