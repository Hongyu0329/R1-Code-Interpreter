    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 0. This conclusion is reached through the following steps based on fundamental theorems in algebraic topology.\n\n1.  **Topological Nature of X**: A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a compact complex surface. As a real manifold, it has a dimension of four.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Group**: According to the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion map from a smooth hypersurface into a complex projective space induces isomorphisms on lower-dimensional homotopy groups. Specifically, for a hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ (where $n \\geq 3$), the map $\\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ is an isomorphism. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected (its fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is trivial), the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$ must also be trivial. Therefore, $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n3.  **Rational Homotopy and Homology**: The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its tensor product with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, we need to find the dimension of $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. The rational Hurewicz theorem states that for a simply connected space like $X$, the Hurewicz map induces an isomorphism between the rational homotopy groups and the rational homology groups. Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the third homology group with rational coefficients, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n4.  **Poincaré Duality**: Since $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-manifold (as all smooth complex manifolds are orientable), Poincaré duality applies. This theorem states that the third homology group is isomorphic to the first cohomology group: $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n5.  **Connection to the Fundamental Group**: The universal coefficient theorem for cohomology relates the first cohomology group to the first homology group, $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Q})$. The Hurewicz theorem states that the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: As established in step 2, $\\pi_1(X)$ is trivial, so its abelianization $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is also trivial. Consequently, $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is trivial, which in turn means $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is trivial. Because of the isomorphism from the rational Hurewicz theorem, this implies that $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is trivial. An abelian group whose rationalization is trivial must be a torsion group. The rank of a torsion group, which corresponds to the size of its free part, is zero.\n\nTherefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
