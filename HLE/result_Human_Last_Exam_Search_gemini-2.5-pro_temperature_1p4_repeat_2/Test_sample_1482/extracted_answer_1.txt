In summary, the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-section of a Gaussian-based Interval Type-3 Membership Function for a fixed primary input `x'` is given by the interval `[μ̲_Ã(x')(u), μ̄_Ã(x')(u)]`, where:

*   **Upper Bound (UMF):**
    `μ̄_Ã(x')(u) = exp[ -½ * ((u - μ̄(x')) / σ_u)² ]`

*   **Lower Bound (LMF):**
    `μ̲_Ã(x')(u) = λ * exp[ -½ * ((u - μ̄(x')) / σ_u*)² ]`

Here, `μ̄(x')` is the upper membership value of the primary input, `λ` is the lower scaling factor, `σ_u` is the standard deviation for the upper bound of the vertical slice, and `σ_u*` is the modified standard deviation for the lower bound, which is a function of a `LowerLag` parameter `l`. This structure comprehensively captures the uncertainty associated with the membership function.
