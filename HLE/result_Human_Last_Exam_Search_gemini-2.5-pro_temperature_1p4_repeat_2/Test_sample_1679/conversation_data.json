    "An American in Paris, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor while also featuring a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk. The iconic Parisian monument is showcased during the film's celebrated ballet sequence.\n\nThe lavish, 17-minute final ballet, choreographed by and starring Gene Kelly, unfolds across various Parisian settings, each stylized to evoke the works of famous French painters. One of these sequences is set in a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is a prominent feature. Specifically, the backdrop for a portion of the ballet is designed in the style of Raoul Dufy's depictions of the square. Furthermore, a live-action shot of the Place de la Concorde, including the obelisk, is seen in the opening montage of the film, establishing the Parisian setting.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners were set in Paris prior to 1951, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), conclusive evidence of the Luxor Obelisk's appearance in their final cuts is not as definitive as it is for *An American in Paris*. The film's win for Best Picture in at the 24th Academy Awards makes it the first recipient of this award to feature the ancient monument.\n\nLater Best Picture winner, *Gigi* (1958), also features scenes filmed at the Place de la Concorde, further cementing the location's cinematic appeal.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
