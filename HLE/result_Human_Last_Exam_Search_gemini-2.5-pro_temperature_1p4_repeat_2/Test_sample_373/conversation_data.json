    "A 10-node barbell graph consists of two complete 5-node graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge, known as the bottleneck or bridge edge. In total, the graph has 10 nodes and a specific structure of edges.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, the process for sampling an edge involves two steps:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph.\n2.  One of its incident edges is then selected uniformly at random.\n\nTo determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, let's analyze the degrees of the nodes in the graph. The two 5-node complete graphs, let's call them K5_A and K5_B, are connected by the bottleneck edge. Let this edge connect node 'u' in K5_A to node 'v' in K5_B.\n\n*   **Nodes not connected to the bridge:** Within each 5-node clique, there are 4 nodes that are not part of the bridge. Each of these nodes is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own clique. Therefore, these 8 nodes (4 in each clique) each have a degree of 4.\n*   **Nodes connected to the bridge:** Node 'u' is connected to the other 4 nodes in K5_A and also to node 'v' via the bottleneck edge. Thus, the degree of 'u' is 4 + 1 = 5. Similarly, the degree of node 'v' is 5.\n\nThe bottleneck edge can only be sampled if either node 'u' or node 'v' is selected in the first step of the gossiping algorithm.\n\nThe probability of selecting any specific node from the 10 total nodes is 1/10.\n\nThe probability calculation unfolds as follows:\n*   **Scenario 1: Node 'u' is selected.** The probability of selecting node 'u' is 1/10. Since 'u' has 5 incident edges, the probability of then selecting the bottleneck edge is 1/5. The total probability for this scenario is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n*   **Scenario 2: Node 'v' is selected.** The probability of selecting node 'v' is also 1/10. Like 'u', 'v' has 5 incident edges, so the probability of selecting the bottleneck edge is 1/5. The total probability for this scenario is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n\nTotal Probability = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25 or 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
