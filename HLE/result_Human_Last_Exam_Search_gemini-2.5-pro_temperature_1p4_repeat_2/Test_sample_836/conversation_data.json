    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as *S(q, ω)* or *S(k, ω)*, in the nuclear criticality community and related fields like reactor physics and condensed matter physics.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, *G(r, t)*, describes how the position of a particle at a certain point in space and time is correlated with the position of another (or the same) particle at a different location and time. The double Fourier transform translates this information from real space and time (variables *r* and *t*) into momentum and energy space (variables *q* and *ω*, representing momentum transfer and energy transfer, respectively).\n\nThis transformed function is crucial for understanding how neutrons scatter within a medium, which is fundamental to nuclear criticality safety analysis. The dynamic structure factor is directly related to the double-differential scattering cross-section, a key quantity used in neutron transport codes for criticality calculations.\n\nIn the context of nuclear data libraries used for reactor simulations, this quantity is often referred to as the **thermal scattering law**, denoted as *S(α, β)*. This is essentially a dimensionless version of the dynamic structure factor. While the foundational concept is attributed to Léon Van Hove, the term \"Van Hove correlation function\" typically refers to the function *G(r, t)* before the Fourier transform is applied.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
