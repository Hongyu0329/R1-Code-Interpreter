    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we must first understand how fractional values are constructed in this game.\n\nIn Red-Blue Hackenbush, finite positions can represent dyadic rational numbers, which are numbers of the form m/2^n. A single stalk of red and blue pieces can represent such a number. The value of a stalk is determined by the colors of its pieces, read from the bottom up.\n\nThe standard formula for the value of a stalk is:\nValue = c₁/2 + c₂/4 + c₃/8 + ... + cₙ/2ⁿ\n\nHere, `n` is the total number of pieces in the stalk. The coefficients `cᵢ` correspond to the color of the i-th piece from the bottom:\n*   `cᵢ = 1` if the piece is red.\n*   `cᵢ = -1` if the piece is blue.\n\nWe need to find the sequence of red and blue pieces that represents the value 13/16. Let's assume it can be done with a stalk of 4 pieces (since the denominator is 16 = 2⁴). The equation is:\n\n13/16 = c₁/2 + c₂/4 + c₃/8 + c₄/16\n\nTo solve for the coefficients `cᵢ`, we can multiply the entire equation by 16:\n\n13 = 8c₁ + 4c₂ + 2c₃ + c₄\n\nNow, we need to find the values of c₁, c₂, c₃, and c₄, which must be either 1 (red) or -1 (blue). We can determine these coefficients greedily, starting with the largest term:\n\n1.  **For c₁:** To get closest to 13, `8c₁` must be positive, so `c₁ = 1`. This gives us `8 * 1 = 8`. The remainder is `13 - 8 = 5`.\n2.  **For c₂:** We now need to represent 5 with `4c₂ + 2c₃ + c₄`. To get closest to 5, `4c₂` must be positive, so `c₂ = 1`. This gives us `4 * 1 = 4`. The remainder is `5 - 4 = 1`.\n3.  **For c₃:** We need to represent 1 with `2c₃ + c₄`. To get closest to 1, `2c₃` should be positive, so `c₃ = 1`. This gives us `2 * 1 = 2`. The remainder is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n4.  **For c₄:** We need to represent -1. Thus, `c₄ = -1`.\n\nSo, the coefficients are (1, 1, 1, -1). Let's verify this:\n8*(1) + 4*(1) + 2*(1) + 1*(-1) = 8 + 4 + 2 - 1 = 13.\nThis is correct.\n\nThe sequence of coefficients (c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄) corresponds to the sequence of pieces from bottom to top:\n*   **Piece 1 (bottom):** c₁ = 1 → Red\n*   **Piece 2:** c₂ = 1 → Red\n*   **Piece 3:** c₃ = 1 → Red\n*   **Piece 4 (top):** c₄ = -1 → Blue\n\nThis construction requires 3 red pieces and 1 blue piece. Therefore, a total of 4 pieces are needed to represent the number 13/16.\n\n<<<4>>>"
