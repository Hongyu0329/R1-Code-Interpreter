    "The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is from Plautus's play *Asinaria*. Like much of Plautus's work, it is written in an iambic senarius, a meter consisting of six iambic feet. Plautine meter, however, is known for its complexity and frequent substitutions, making a straightforward scansion challenging. A key feature is *brevis brevians*, or iambic shortening, where a long syllable following a short one can be shortened.\n\nBased on an analysis considering these principles, the scansion is as follows:\n\nL S S S L S L L S S L S S\n\nBroken into feet, this becomes:\n\nLSS SL | S L | L L | SS L | S S\n\nThis reading translates to a resolved iamb (anapest), followed by a spondee (counted as an iamb), a standard iamb, another spondee, a resolved iamb (tribrach), and a final iamb. This pattern of substitutions is characteristic of Plautine comedy.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L S S L S S>>>"
