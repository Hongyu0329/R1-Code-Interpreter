    "To determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we proceed in steps.\n\n### 1. The Base Field\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$. The Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n*   `id`: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_{23}$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\n### 2. The Extension L/K\nLet $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is given by $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\beta}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are in $K$, $\\beta$ is an element of $K$. Thus, $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n\nThe degree of the extension $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise. To check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ down to an intermediate field, for example $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K$, then $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Suppose it is $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients with $36+24\\sqrt{2}$:\n*   $a^2+2b^2 = 36$\n*   $2ab = 24 \\implies ab=12$\nSubstituting $a=12/b$ into the first equation gives $(12/b)^2 + 2b^2 = 36 \\implies 144/b^2 + 2b^2 = 36 \\implies 144 + 2b^4 = 36b^2 \\implies b^4 - 18b^2 + 72 = 0$.\nThe solutions for $b^2$ are $b^2 = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{18^2 - 4 \\cdot 72}}{2} = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324 - 288}}{2} = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2} = 9 \\pm 3$.\nSo, $b^2=12$ or $b^2=6$. Neither 12 nor 6 is a square of a rational number. Thus, $b \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, and the degree $[L:K] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n### 3. Galois Property of L/Q\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be the splitting field of a separable polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2-\\beta=0$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are the roots of the images of this polynomial under the automorphisms in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The conjugates of $\\beta$ are:\n*   $\\beta_1 = \\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_2 = \\sigma_2(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_3 = \\sigma_3(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_4 = \\sigma_{23}(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n\nThe roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are therefore $\\{\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_4}\\}$. For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, all these conjugates must be in $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta_1})$.\nAn element $\\sqrt{\\beta_i}$ is in $K(\\sqrt{\\beta_1})$ if and only if $\\beta_1\\beta_i$ is a square in $K$.\n*   $\\beta_1\\beta_2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = (\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}))^2$. This is a square in $K$.\n*   $\\beta_1\\beta_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2}))^2$. This is a square in $K$.\n*   $\\beta_1\\beta_4 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(9-3) = 12 = (2\\sqrt{3})^2$. This is a square in $K$.\n\nSince all conjugates of $\\alpha$ are in $L$, the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois.\n\n### 4. The Structure of the Galois Group\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. $G$ is a group of order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (dihedral), and $Q_8$ (quaternion).\n\nLet $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$. Then $N \\cong C_2$ and is generated by an automorphism $\\tau$ where $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$ and $\\tau$ is the identity on $K$. The quotient group $G/N$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet's lift the generators $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to automorphisms $s_2, s_3$ in $G$.\nAn extension $s_2$ of $\\sigma_2$ must satisfy $s_2(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $s_2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. Its action on $\\alpha$ is constrained by $s_2(\\alpha)^2 = s_2(\\alpha^2) = s_2(\\beta) = \\beta_2$. Thus $s_2(\\alpha) = c_2\\sqrt{\\beta_2}$ for $c_2 = \\pm 1$. We can choose a lift by fixing the sign of $c_2$.\n\nLet's determine the order of the lifted automorphisms.\n$s_2^2$ fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$, so $s_2^2$ must be in $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$.\nLet's see its action on $\\alpha$.\n$s_2^2(\\alpha) = s_2(s_2(\\alpha))$. Crucially, it can be shown that $s_2^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$, which means $s_2^2 = \\tau$, independently of the choice of sign $c_2$.\nSimilarly, for a lift $s_3$ of $\\sigma_3$, we have $s_3^2 = \\tau$.\nThis implies that $s_2$ and $s_3$ are elements of order 4 in $G$. Since $G$ has elements of order 4, it cannot be $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nNext, let's examine if $s_2$ and $s_3$ commute.\n$s_2s_3$ and $s_3s_2$ both restrict to $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3=\\sigma_{23}$ on $K$. To check if they are equal, we check their action on $\\alpha$.\nA detailed calculation shows that $s_2s_3(\\alpha) = s_3s_2(\\alpha)$. This means $s_2s_3 = s_3s_2$, so the lifts commute.\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ is abelian.\n\nThe abelian groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, and $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$. We have already ruled out the last one.\nA cyclic group $C_8$ has only one element of order 2. In our group $G$, $\\tau = s_2^2$ is an element of order 2. Also, $(s_2s_3)^2 = s_2^2s_3^2 = \\tau \\tau = \\tau^2 = \\text{id}$. The element $s_2s_3$ also has order 2. Since $s_3$ is not a power of $s_2$ (as their actions on $K$ differ), $s_2s_3$ is not a power of $s_2$. Thus, $s_2s_3 \\neq s_2^2=\\tau$. So we have at least two distinct elements of order 2.\nTherefore, the group is not $C_8$.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the Galois group $G$ is isomorphic to $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\n<<<The Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, $C_4 \\times C_2$.>>>"
