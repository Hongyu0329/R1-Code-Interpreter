    "While many mushrooms exhibit a stunning blue coloration on their caps and stems, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. The color of a mushroom's fruiting body does not determine the color of its spores.\n\nSeveral well-known blue-hued mushrooms have spore prints of different colors:\n\n*   **Lactarius indigo**, known as the Indigo Milk Cap, is a striking blue mushroom but produces a cream to pale yellowish spore print.\n*   **Entoloma hochstetteri**, a vibrant blue mushroom native to New Zealand, has a pink spore print.\n*   **Stropharia caerulea**, or the Blue Roundhead, has a purple-black spore print.\n*   **Panaeolus cyanescens**, which bruises blue, has a black spore print.\n*   Species in the **Psilocybe** genus, famous for their blue-bruising psychoactive properties, do not have blue spores.\n*   **Gymnopilus aeruginosus**, another blue-staining mushroom, has a rusty-orange spore print.\n\nThe blue coloration in some fungi, like *Entoloma hochstetteri*, is due to pigments called azulenes. Other blue-staining fungi get their color from the oxidation of psilocin. However, these pigments do not translate to the color of the spores.\n\nTherefore, the premise of the question that there is a single genus of mushroom known for a distinctly blue spore print appears to be incorrect based on available mycological information.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
