    "The determinant of the given adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver is 0.\n\nThe matrix is provided as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the standard formula:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAn alternative method to determine that the determinant is zero is to observe the properties of the matrix's rows and columns. If the sum of the rows or columns of a square matrix is a zero vector, then the determinant of the matrix is zero. In this case, the sum of each row is 0:\n*   Row 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 2: -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 3: -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\n\nSimilarly, the sum of each column is also 0. This linear dependence among the rows (and columns) means the matrix is singular, and thus its determinant is 0.\n\nThe context mentioning the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" specifies the mathematical context in which this matrix arises, likely within the theory of cluster algebras where Markov numbers play a role. However, the calculation itself is a direct computation on the given matrix A.\n\n<<<0>>>"
