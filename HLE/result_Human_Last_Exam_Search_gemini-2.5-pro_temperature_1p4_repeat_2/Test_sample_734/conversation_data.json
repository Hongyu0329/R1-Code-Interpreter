    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo** (A.D. 354-430).\n\nAugustine was the first Christian thinker to systematically address the possibility of miracles within a world governed by a divine order. He developed a sophisticated framework that avoided portraying miracles as arbitrary violations of God's established laws.\n\nKey elements of Augustine's specialized terminology include:\n\n*   ***Rationes Seminales* (Seminal Reasons):** Augustine proposed that God embedded \"seminal reasons\" or latent potentialities into creation from the very beginning. Miraculous events, therefore, are not a new intervention that breaks natural law, but the activation of these pre-existing, hidden potentials. For example, the turning of water into wine was not a violation of nature, but a divine acceleration of the natural processes that God already oversees.\n\n*   **\"Contrary to What We Know of Nature\":** Augustine's most famous dictum on the subject is that a miracle (*portentum*) is not \"contrary to nature, but contrary to what we *know* of nature\" (*non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura*). He argued that since God's will is the ultimate \"nature\" of every created thing, nothing that happens by His will can truly be \"against nature.\" Miracles only appear to be violations because of our limited human understanding of the full scope of the natural order God has created.\n\nThis theological framework is directly applicable to understanding the virgin birth. From an Augustinian perspective, the virgin birth would not be a rupture of biological laws but the actualization of a unique *ratio seminalis* placed within creation by God, intended from the beginning for the Incarnation of Christ.\n\nWhile Augustine himself argued that the Fall corrupted human nature rather than fundamentally altering the laws of the physical world, his terminology could be applied to describe such a change. One could argue, using his framework, that the curse on creation after the Fall involved the activation of latent negative \"seminal reasons\" that introduced concepts like decay or agricultural toil in a new way.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
