    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.**\n\nOf the naturally occurring noble gases—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon—radon is the rarest. Its extreme rarity is a direct consequence of its radioactivity and short half-life.\n\nRadon is a product of the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are found in the Earth's crust. Because it is continually produced, it is always present in the environment. However, its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only about 3.8 days. This rapid decay means that it does not accumulate in significant quantities.\n\nThe average concentration of radon in the Earth's atmosphere is minuscule, estimated to be about 1 part in 10^21, which is equivalent to 0.0000000000000000001%. Its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is also incredibly low, at approximately 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram.\n\nIn contrast, the other noble gases are far more abundant. After nitrogen and oxygen, argon is the third most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, making up about 0.934% of it. The atmospheric abundances of the other stable noble gases are:\n*   Neon: 0.0018%\n*   Helium: 0.00052%\n*   Krypton: 0.000114%\n*   Xenon: 0.0000087%\n\nWhile the exact figures for the year 2002 are not specifically available in the search results, the abundances of these gases are not subject to significant short-term fluctuations. Therefore, the data available from various years around that time provides a reliable picture for 2002. Given the vast difference in magnitude between the concentration of radon and the other noble gases, it can be definitively stated that radon was the rarest.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
