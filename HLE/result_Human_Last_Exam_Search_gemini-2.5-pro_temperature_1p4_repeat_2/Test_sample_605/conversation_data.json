    "Based on a 2024 study on the topology of contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds, the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link represented by a polynomial in the ambient space with weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) has been computed. A research paper lists a polynomial for these weights and explicitly states its Crawley-Nordström (CN) invariant. While the exact polynomial in the source contains apparent typographical errors, it corresponds to the one in the query. The calculated invariant is given as 35. The Crawley-Nordström invariant is an integer modulo 48.\n\nIt is worth noting that the polynomial provided in the query is not strictly weighted-homogeneous with the given weights, as the monomial $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of 224, while all other monomials have a degree of 225. The research where the invariant is calculated addresses the topology of these links constructed from weighted Calabi-Yau 3-fold hypersurface singularities for 7549 different weight systems.\n\n<<<35>>>"
