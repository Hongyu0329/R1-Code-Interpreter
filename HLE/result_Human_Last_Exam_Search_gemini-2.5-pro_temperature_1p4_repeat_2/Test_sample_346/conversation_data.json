    "To solve this problem, we must evaluate the given SKI combinator expression to determine the Church integer `n` it represents, and then calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n`. This requires a step-by-step reduction of the expression based on the rules of SKI combinator logic.\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nThis expression can be broken down into a nested application structure. The overall form is `C(C(C(A)))`, where `A` and `C` are themselves complex combinator expressions.\n\nFirst, we identify the components:\n*   The combinator `B = S(KS)K` represents function composition: `Bf gx = f(gx)`. The expression in the problem, `S(S(K(S))(K))`, is `S(B)`.\n*   Let `X = S(B)`. The reduction rule for `S(B)` is `(S(B) f g) x = f((g f) x)`.\n\nLet's define `A` and `C` from the expression:\n*   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I) = S(B)I`\n*   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)) = S(B)U`, where `U = SII` is the self-application combinator (`Ux = xx`).\n\nNow, we determine what Church numerals `A` and `C` correspond to, or how they operate on other Church numerals.\n\n**Analysis of A:**\nThe combinator `A` is `S(B)I`. Let's see how it operates on a function `f` and an argument `x`. In some interpretations, this can be shown to be equivalent to the Church numeral for 2 (`c₂`).\n`A = S(B)I = λf.λx. f(fx) = c₂`\nThis means `A` represents the number 2.\n\n**Analysis of C:**\nThe combinator `C` is `S(B)U`. This operator transforms a Church numeral `cₙ` into a new one. Let's find this transformation. `C` applied to a Church numeral `cₙ` is the combinator `C(cₙ)`. We want to find what number this new combinator represents.\n\nThe operation `C(cₙ)` when applied to a function `h` can be reduced as follows:\n`(C cₙ) h = cₙ((cₙcₙ)h)`\nWe know that for Church numerals, the application `cₙcₘ` corresponds to exponentiation, resulting in `c_{mⁿ}`. Therefore, `cₙcₙ` results in `c_{n²}`.\nSubstituting this back:\n`(C cₙ) h = cₙ((c_{n²})h)`\nThe term `(c_{n²})h` is equivalent to composing `h` with itself `n²` times, i.e., `hⁿ²`.\nFinally, applying `cₙ` to `hⁿ²` means composing `hⁿ²` with itself `n` times: `(hⁿ²)ⁿ = hⁿ³`.\nThis means the combinator `C(cₙ)` is equivalent to the Church numeral `c_{n³}`. Thus, the operator `C` cubes the Church numeral it is applied to.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nThe full expression is `E = C(C(C(A)))`.\n1.  Starting with `A = c₂`, so our initial number is `n₀ = 2`.\n2.  The first application of `C` yields `C(c₂) = c_{2³} = c₈`. Our new number is `n₁ = 8`.\n3.  The second application of `C` yields `C(c₈) = c_{8³} = c₅₁₂`. Our new number is `n₂ = 512`.\n4.  The third and final application of `C` yields `C(c₅₁₂) = c_{512³}`. So, the final integer is `n = 512³`.\n\nNow, we need to find `log₂(n)`:\n`n = 512³ = (2⁹)³ = 2²⁷`\n`log₂(n) = log₂(2²⁷) = 27`\n\n<<<27>>>"
