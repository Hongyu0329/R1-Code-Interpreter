The second coefficient, `a_2`, in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field contains a term proportional to the square of the gauge field strength, `F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}`. The full expression for the trace of the local `a_2` coefficient, in 4-dimensions, for a Dirac operator squared is given by `tr(a_2) = c_1 R^2 + c_2 R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} + c_3 R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} + c_4 \text{tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})`, where the coefficient `c_4` is `-1/12` after taking the trace over spinor indices.
