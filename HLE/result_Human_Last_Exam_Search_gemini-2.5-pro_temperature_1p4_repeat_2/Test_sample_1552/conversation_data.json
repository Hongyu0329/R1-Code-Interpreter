    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is a geometric invariant that depends on the curvature of the spacetime manifold and the field strength of the gauge field.\n\nThe spectral action is given by the trace of a function of the Laplacian, `Tr(f(D^2/\\Lambda^2))`, where `D` is the gauged Dirac operator and `\\Lambda` is a cutoff scale. The asymptotic expansion of this action for large `\\Lambda` is determined by the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the heat kernel for the operator `D^2`.\n\nThe heat kernel `K(t) = e^{-tD^2}` has an asymptotic expansion for small `t` whose trace is given by:\n`Tr(K(t)) \\sim \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{d/2}} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n t^n`\nwhere `d` is the dimension of the manifold and the coefficients `a_n` are integrals of local geometric invariants.\n\nThe operator `D^2` for a massless gauged Dirac spinor is a Laplace-type operator. The Dirac operator is given by `D = \\gamma^\\mu (\\partial_\\mu + \\omega_\\mu + iA_\\mu)`, where `\\omega_\\mu` is the spin connection and `A_\\mu` is the gauge field potential. Squaring this gives `D^2 = -(\\nabla_\\mu \\nabla^\\mu + \\frac{1}{4}R) + \\frac{i}{2} \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu F_{\\mu\\nu}`, where `R` is the scalar curvature and `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the gauge field strength.\n\nThe second coefficient, `a_2`, in this expansion for a Dirac spinor field in four dimensions has been computed. Its trace density is given by:\n\n`tr(a_2) = \\text{Tr}_S \\left( \\frac{1}{12} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} \\mathbb{I}_S + \\frac{1}{60} (R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{5}{2}R^2) \\mathbb{I}_S \\right)`\nwhere `Tr_S` denotes the trace over the spinor indices, `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the gauge field strength, and `R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}`, `R_{\\mu\\nu}`, and `R` are the Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature, respectively. The term `\\mathbb{I}_S` is the identity matrix in the spinor space.\n\nThe specific part of the coefficient that involves the gauge field is `(1/12) \\text{Tr}_S(\\mathbb{I}_S) F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}`. In four dimensions, the dimension of the spinor representation is 4, so `\\text{Tr}_S(\\mathbb{I}_S) = 4`. Therefore, the gauge field contribution to `a_2` is `(1/3) F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}`.\n\nThe full second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a_2` integrated over the manifold `M` for a four-dimensional massless gauged Dirac spinor field is:\n`a_2 = \\int_M d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\left( -\\frac{1}{360} (R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu}) - \\frac{1}{72} R^2 - \\frac{1}{12} \\text{tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}) \\right)`\nNote that there is a conventional minus sign for fermionic fields in the overall trace. The precise coefficients can vary slightly in the literature depending on conventions. A frequently cited result for the gauge field part is `-1/12` times the trace of the field strength squared.\n\n<<<The second coefficient, `a_2`, in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field contains a term proportional to the square of the gauge field strength, `F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}`. The full expression for the trace of the local `a_2` coefficient, in 4-dimensions, for a Dirac operator squared is given by `tr(a_2) = c_1 R^2 + c_2 R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + c_3 R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + c_4 \\text{tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})`, where the coefficient `c_4` is `-1/12` after taking the trace over spinor indices.>>>"
