    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category consists of a pair of morphisms, a left adjoint $L: X \\to Y$ and a right adjoint $R: Y \\to X$, along with two 2-morphisms (the unit and counit) that satisfy certain coherence conditions. In the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of the category of posets ($\\mathsf{Pos}$), the objects are non-empty finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, and the morphisms are order-preserving maps. The 2-morphisms are given by the natural pointwise ordering of these maps.\n\nFor an adjunction between $[m]$ and $[n]$, we need a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, that satisfy the inequalities $id_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$ and $L \\circ R \\le id_{[n]}$. These conditions are equivalent to the more common definition of a Galois connection or a residuated pair for posets: for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the equivalence $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ holds.\n\nA key theorem in category theory states that a functor is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all colimits, and a functor is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all limits. For posets viewed as categories, colimits correspond to suprema (joins) and limits correspond to infima (meets).\n\nAn order-preserving map between totally ordered sets like $[k]$ automatically preserves all non-empty suprema and infima. The crucial conditions arise from the empty set.\n1.  For $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve the supremum of the empty set. In $[m]$, the empty set's supremum is the least element, 0. Thus, $L$ must map the bottom element of $[m]$ to the bottom element of $[n]$, which means $L(0)=0$.\n2.  Dually, for $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, it must preserve the infimum of the empty set. In $[n]$, this is the greatest element, $n$. Thus, $R$ must map the top element of $[n]$ to the top element of $[m]$, meaning $R(n)=m$.\n\nFor any order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ that satisfies $L(0)=0$, a unique right adjoint $R$ can be constructed. Similarly, for any order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ satisfying $R(n)=m$, a unique left adjoint $L$ exists. Therefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of such maps.\n\nLet's count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ with the property $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of 24 values:\n$L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$\nwhere each $L(i) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ and $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first element of the sequence. We are left with determining the sequence $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ subject to the constraint:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing 23 items with replacement from a set of 38 elements ($\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$). This is a stars-and-bars problem, and the number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $n$ is the number of items to choose from and $k$ is the number of chosen items.\nHere, $k=23$ (for the values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) and $n=38$ (the set of possible values $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$).\nThe total number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAs a consistency check, we can also count the number of valid right adjoints $R: \\to$. Such a map must satisfy $R(37)=23$. This requires choosing 37 values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (a set of 24 elements) with replacement, which gives $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, confirming the result.\n\nThe value of $\\binom{60}{23}$ is $45,845,881,300,004,510$.\n\n<<<45845881300004510>>>"
