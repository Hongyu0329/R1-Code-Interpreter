    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a potent symbol of his wavering and fearful mentality. The act of removing and donning his overcoat is mentioned six times, each instance marking a shift in his judgment based on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner.\n\nThe story opens with Otchumyelov walking across the market square in a new overcoat. This initial presentation establishes his official status and self-importance. The subsequent mentions of the coat, however, highlight his spinelessness.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the instances where the coat is mentioned:\n\n1.  **Initial Appearance:** Otchumyelov is introduced walking across the market square \"wearing a new overcoat.\"\n2.  **First Shift:** When it is suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling hot, asks his subordinate, Yeldyrin, to take off his cloak.\n3.  **Second Shift:** After being assured the dog is not the general's, he feels a chill and asks for his coat to be put back on.\n4.  **Third Shift:** A bystander mentions that the dog might indeed be the general's. Feeling the wind, Otchumyelov asks Yeldyrin to help him on with his overcoat again, as he is cold.\n5.  **Fourth Shift:** The general's cook, Prohor, definitively states that the dog does not belong to the general. Otchumyelov immediately declares it a stray.\n6.  **Fifth Shift:** Prohor then clarifies that the dog belongs to the general's brother. At this, Otchumyelov wraps his coat around himself and continues on his way.\n\nThese repeated actions of taking off and putting on the coat underscore Otchumyelov's sycophantic nature and his fear of offending a person of high status. His physical response to the changing situation, symbolized by the coat, visually represents his internal vacillation and lack of conviction.\n\n<<<6>>>"
