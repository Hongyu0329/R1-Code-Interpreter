    "**No Record of 1950 Architectural Removal in Piazza della Rotonda; Bell Towers Demolished from Pantheon in 1883**\n\nThere is no historical evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome in 1950. Extensive historical records and architectural histories of the square and the Pantheon do not mention any such event in that year.\n\nIt is likely that the query is based on a historical inaccuracy, possibly confusing the date or the specific architectural element. The most significant and well-documented architectural removal in the vicinity of the Piazza della Rotonda was the demolition of two bell towers from the facade of the Pantheon in 1883.\n\nThese twin towers, often misattributed to the famed architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, were added in the 17th century under Pope Urban VIII. The towers were widely disliked by the Roman populace, who gave them the derisive nickname \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears). The removal of these controversial bell towers in the late 19th century was part of an effort to restore the Pantheon to its original, classical appearance.\n\nWhile major urban changes and demolitions did occur in Rome around the mid-20th century, particularly for the 1950 Jubilee, these were concentrated in other areas. A notable example is the demolition of the \"Spina\" di Borgo to create the grand Via della Conciliazione leading to St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe history of the Piazza della Rotonda itself has seen various transformations, including the clearing of medieval shops and sheds that once crowded the square and the addition of the central fountain in 1575 and the obelisk in 1711. However, no significant removal of an architectural feature from the square is recorded for the year 1950.\n\n<<<There is no record of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.
