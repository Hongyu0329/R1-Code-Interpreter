    "The calculation is complete and the search results confirm the methodology. Specifically, the search results reiterate the formula for the wave function, the probability density, and the general approach of integrating the probability density over the specified interval to find the probability. The search results also confirm that for n=2, the wave function has a node at the center of the box (x=a/2), meaning the probability of finding the particle *at* that exact point is zero. My calculation correctly deals with finding the probability in a small interval *around* this node.\n\nI have performed the calculation in two different ways (exact integration and Taylor approximation) and arrived at the same result, which gives me high confidence in the answer.\n\nThe problem requires finding the probability `P` that a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is located in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a` for the `n=2` energy state.\n\n**1. The Wave Function and Probability Density**\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box for a given quantum number `n` is:\n`ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\nFor the `n=2` state, this becomes:\n`ψ₂(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n\nThe probability density, `|ψ(x)|²`, is the square of the wave function:\n`|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\n**2. Setting up the Probability Integral**\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval `[x₁, x₂]` is given by the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**3. Solving the Integral**\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`.\nIn our case, `θ = 2πx / a`, so `2θ = 4πx / a`.\n\n`P = (2/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/2) * [1 - cos(4πx / a)] dx`\n`P = (1/a) * [x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n\nEvaluating the expression at the limits:\n`P = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a / 4π) * (sin(4π * 0.505a / a) - sin(4π * 0.495a / a)) ]`\n`P = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a / 4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]`\n`P = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n\nUsing the trigonometric properties `sin(2π + α) = sin(α)` and `sin(2π - α) = -sin(α)`, we can simplify the sine terms:\n`sin(2.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n`sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n\nSubstituting these back into the probability equation:\n`P = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]`\n`P = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [2 * sin(0.02π)]`\n`P = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)`\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value.\nThe argument of the sine function is `0.02π`. For small values of `u`, we can use the Taylor series expansion `sin(u) ≈ u - u³/6`.\nLet `u = 0.02π`.\n`P ≈ 0.01 - ( (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ) / (2π)`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - (0.01 - (0.02π)² / 12)`\n`P ≈ (0.02π)² / 12`\n`P ≈ (0.0004 * π²) / 12`\n`P ≈ (π² / 3) * 10⁻⁴ * (1/1)`\n`P ≈ (9.8696 / 3) * 10⁻⁴`\n`P ≈ 3.2898 * 10⁻⁴`\n\nLet's re-calculate `(0.0004 * π²) / 12`\n`P ≈ (0.0004 * 9.8696044) / 12 ≈ 0.0039478 / 12 ≈ 0.00032898`\n\nLet's re-do the `P ≈ (u³)/(12π)` approximation:\n`P ≈ ((0.02π)³)/(12π) = (0.000008π³)/(12π) = (0.000008π²)/12 = (8 x 10⁻⁶ * π²)/12 = (2/3)π² * 10⁻⁶`\n`P ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696044 * 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\n\nThere was a calculation mistake. Let me restart the numerical part carefully.\n\n`P = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)`\nUsing a calculator:\n`0.02 * π ≈ 0.06283185`\n`sin(0.06283185) ≈ 0.06279052`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - 0.06279052 / (2 * π)`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - 0.06279052 / 6.283185`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999343`\n`P ≈ 0.00000657`\n\nThis matches the approximation via Taylor expansion of the integrand:\n`P = (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n`P = (16 * π² / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n`P ≈ 52.6378 * 1.25 x 10⁻⁷`\n`P ≈ 6.5797 x 10⁻⁶`\n`P ≈ 0.00000658`\n\nThe probability is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶` or `0.00000658`. This is a very small number, which is expected because the interval is centered on the node at `x=a/2`, where the probability density is zero.\n\nFinal Answer is approximately `6.58e-6`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
