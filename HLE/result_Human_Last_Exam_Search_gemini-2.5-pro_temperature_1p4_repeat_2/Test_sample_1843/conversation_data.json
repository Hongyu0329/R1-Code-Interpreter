    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Factorize the conductor $N$ into its prime power components.\n2.  Understand the conditions for a Dirichlet character to be primitive and to have a specific order.\n3.  Count the number of suitable primitive characters for each prime power factor.\n4.  Combine the results to get the total count.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N=36036$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$.\n\nFor the character $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be primitive for its respective modulus.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{order}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{order}(\\chi_7), \\text{order}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{order}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe require this order to be 6.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each factor of $N$ whose order is a divisor of 6. The group of Dirichlet characters modulo $m$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of integers modulo $m$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^*$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It has two characters. The principal character has conductor 1, and the other is a primitive character of order 2. So, there is **1** primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo $p^a$ ($p$ odd) is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(p^{a-1})$. Here, a character modulo 9 is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders of characters are the divisors of 6. The orders of primitive characters are therefore 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   There are $2+2=\\textbf{4}$ primitive characters modulo 9, with orders that are divisors of 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the trivial character (which has order 1). The orders must be divisors of 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   There are $1+2+2=\\textbf{5}$ primitive characters modulo 7 with orders that are divisors of 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10 (excluding 1). For the lcm to be 6, the order must be a divisor of 6. The only common divisor of 10 and 6 greater than 1 is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   There is **1** primitive character modulo 11 whose order is a divisor of 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12 (excluding 1). We need the order to be a divisor of 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   There are $1+2+2=\\textbf{5}$ primitive characters modulo 13 with orders that are divisors of 6.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\nLet $o_{p^a}$ be the order of the primitive character $\\chi_{p^a}$. We need to find the number of combinations of these characters such that $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n\nThe possible orders for our selected primitive characters are:\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} = 2$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm of these orders must divide 6 since each individual order divides 6.\nFurthermore, the lcm must be a multiple of 2, since $o_4=2$.\nThe lcm must also be a multiple of 3, since $o_9$ is either 3 or 6.\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6.\nThus, for any valid choice of the component characters, their lcm will be exactly 6.\n\nWe can now calculate the total number of such characters by multiplying the number of choices for each component:\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (order 2).\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4 (order 3 or 6).\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5 (order 2, 3, or 6).\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (order 2).\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5 (order 2, 3, or 6).\n\nTotal number of primitive characters of order 6 is the product:\n$1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
