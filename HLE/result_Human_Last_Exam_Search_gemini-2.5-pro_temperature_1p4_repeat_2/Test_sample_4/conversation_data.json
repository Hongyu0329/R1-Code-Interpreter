    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first analyze its structure. The non-zero commutation relations are:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial $P_\\mathfrak{g}(x)$ is the generating function for the dimensions of the homology groups of $\\mathfrak{g}$ with trivial real coefficients. Due to Poincaré duality for unimodular Lie algebras (which include all nilpotent Lie algebras), this polynomial is symmetric. It is equivalent to the Poincaré polynomial for the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$, which we will compute.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be seen as a fiber product of two smaller Lie algebras over the one-dimensional algebra $\\mathbb{R}e_1$. Let $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ be the 4-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ with relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$ and $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$. This is the model filiform Lie algebra of dimension 4, often denoted $\\mathfrak{f}_4$. Let $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ be the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra spanned by $\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$ with relation $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n\nFor nilpotent Lie algebras, which are formal, the cohomology can be computed using the Künneth formula for fiber products. The Poincaré polynomial for the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$, denoted $P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$, is given by:\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P^{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) \\cdot P^{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P^{\\mathbb{R}}(x)}$\nwhere $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x)$, $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)$, and $P^{\\mathbb{R}}(x)$ are the Poincaré polynomials for $\\mathfrak{g}_1$, $\\mathfrak{g}_2$, and the 1-dimensional abelian algebra $\\mathbb{R}$, respectively.\n\n1.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ (4D filiform Lie algebra):**\n    The Betti numbers for this algebra are $(1, 2, 3, 2, 1)$.\n    Thus, its Poincaré polynomial is $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n\n2.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ (3D Heisenberg algebra):**\n    The Betti numbers are $(1, 2, 2, 1)$.\n    Thus, its Poincaré polynomial is $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n\n3.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathbb{R}$ (1D abelian algebra):**\n    The Poincaré polynomial is $P^{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1 + x$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1 + x}$\n\nWe can factor the polynomial for the Heisenberg algebra: $1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3 = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$.\nSubstituting this into the formula gives:\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1+x)(1+x+x^2)}{1 + x}$\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)(1 + x + x^2)$\n\nExpanding this product:\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + (x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (3+2+1)x^2 + (2+3+2)x^3 + (1+2+3)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n$P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 7x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThe Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are $\\beta_0=1, \\beta_1=3, \\beta_2=6, \\beta_3=7, \\beta_4=6, \\beta_5=3, \\beta_6=1$. Since this polynomial is symmetric, the Poincaré polynomial for the homology is identical to the one for the cohomology.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 7*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
