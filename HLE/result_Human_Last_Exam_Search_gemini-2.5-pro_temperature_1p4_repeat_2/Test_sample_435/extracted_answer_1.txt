Based on the evidence, I predict that CAR T-cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit a significantly more robust and pro-inflammatory cytokine release profile, including higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, compared to CAR T-cells manufactured without it. This is supported by preclinical data showing increased cytokine secretion in vitro and clinical data indicating a higher incidence of cytokine release syndrome.
