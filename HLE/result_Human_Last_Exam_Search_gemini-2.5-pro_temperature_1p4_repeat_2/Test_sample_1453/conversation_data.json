    "To determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil sequence, we must analyze its heptad repeat pattern and apply the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n### 1. Understanding Coiled-Coil Structure and Heptad Repeats\n\nCoiled-coil proteins are formed by two or more α-helices that wrap around each other. Their amino acid sequences feature a characteristic seven-residue repeat, known as a heptad repeat, with positions labeled `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The stability of the coiled-coil structure is primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions between the amino acid side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions, which form the core of the assembly.\n\n### 2. The \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Packing Model\n\nThe side chains of residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions (the \"knobs\") of one helix fit into the spaces (\"holes\") created by the side chains of the adjacent helix. The efficiency and geometry of this packing are highly dependent on the size and shape of the specific amino acids at these core 'a' and 'd' positions. This relationship is so predictive that the identity of the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions can determine the oligomeric state (i.e., the number of helices in the coil).\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Sequence: GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\n\nFirst, we need to identify the heptad repeat within the given sequence. We look for a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues are consistently found at the 'a' and 'd' positions, which are separated by two and three other residues, respectively.\n\nThe hydrophobic amino acids in the sequence are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W). Let's lay out the sequence and identify the hydrophobic core pattern:\n\n`G E` **`I`** `A Q S` **`L`** `K E` **`I`** `A K S` **`L`** `K E` **`I`** `A` **`W`** `S` **`L`** `K E` **`I`** `A Q S` **`L`** `K G`\n\nA clear repeating pattern emerges where positions 'a' and 'd' are occupied by specific hydrophobic residues. Let's assign the heptad positions based on this pattern:\n\n*   **Assigning the Register:** If we assign position 7 (Leucine) as 'a', then position 10 (Isoleucine) is at 'd'. Following this pattern (`a b c d e f g`):\n\n    *   Heptad 1: `(K E` **`I`** `A Q S` **`L`**`)` -> `a`=**L**, `d`=**I**\n    *   Heptad 2: `(K E` **`I`** `A K S` **`L`**`)` -> `a`=**L**, `d`=**I**\n    *   Heptad 3: `(K E` **`I`** `A` **`W`** `S` **`L`**`)` -> `a`=**L**, `d`=**W** (Tryptophan, another bulky hydrophobic residue)\n    *   Heptad 4: `(K E` **`I`** `A Q S` **`L`**`)` -> `a`=**L**, `d`=**I**\n\n*   **Identifying the Core Pattern:** The sequence overwhelmingly has **Leucine (L) at the 'a' positions** and **Isoleucine (I)** or another bulky hydrophobic residue (W) **at the 'd' positions**.\n\n### 4. Predicting the Oligomeric State\n\nSeminal studies on the GCN4 protein established rules linking the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions to the oligomeric state:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Predominantly Isoleucine (I) at position 'a' and Leucine (L) at position 'd'.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Predominantly Isoleucine (I) at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Predominantly **Leucine (L) at position 'a'** and **Isoleucine (I) at position 'd'**.\n\nThe sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` fits the established pattern for a **tetramer**, with Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine (or the similarly bulky Tryptophan) at the 'd' positions. The packing of the smaller, unbranched Leucine side chains at 'a' and the bulkier, β-branched Isoleucine side chains at 'd' is most efficiently accommodated in a four-helix bundle.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein coiled-coil sequence would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
