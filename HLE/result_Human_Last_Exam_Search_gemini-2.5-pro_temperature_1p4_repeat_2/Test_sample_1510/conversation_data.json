    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. Each wallpaper group has an associated point group, which describes the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern around a single point. An order of 2 for a point group signifies that it contains two symmetry operations: the identity operation and either a 180-degree rotation (a C₂ group) or a reflection (a D₁ group, which is isomorphic to C₂).\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified by their distinct symmetry properties. Out of these, the following four have a point group of order 2:\n\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C₂, meaning it only has 180-degree rotational symmetry and no reflections.\n*   **pm**: The point group for pm is D₁, indicating that it has reflection symmetry but no rotational symmetry.\n*   **pg**: Similar to pm, the point group for pg is D₁. In this case, the reflection symmetry is realized as a glide reflection.\n*   **cm**: This group also has the point group D₁, featuring reflection symmetry.\n\nOther wallpaper groups possess point groups of different orders, such as order 1 (p1), order 4 (e.g., pmm, pmg, pgg, cmm), or higher.\n\n<<<4>>>"
