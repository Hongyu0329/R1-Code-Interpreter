    "The problem asks for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $f(g(x))$, where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3 with first derivatives that are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n\nA fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. We are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n1.  **Degree of the Equation:**\n    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the function $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n2.  **Properties of f(x) and g(x):**\n    Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ with $a \\neq 0$. Its derivative is $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. The condition $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ implies two things about this quadratic:\n    *   It must open upwards, so its leading coefficient is positive: $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\n    *   It must not have real roots, so its discriminant must be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\n\n    Similarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ with $p \\neq 0$, the condition $g'(x) > 0$ implies $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n\n    Since $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also strictly increasing, because by the chain rule, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$, and the product of two positive functions is positive.\n\n3.  **Existence of 9 Fixed Points:**\n    The question is whether it is possible to achieve 9 fixed points under these conditions. For a polynomial of degree 9, say $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$, to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $k'(x)$ must have 8 distinct real roots, according to Rolle's Theorem.\n    The derivative is $k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    We need to determine if the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ can have 8 distinct real roots.\n\n    Let's analyze the derivative term $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$:\n    *   $f'(y) = 3ay^2 + 2by + c$ is a polynomial of degree 2 in $y$.\n    *   $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ is a polynomial of degree 3 in $x$.\n    *   $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$ is a polynomial of degree 2 in $x$.\n    *   The composition $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$ in $x$.\n    *   The product $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$ in $x$.\n\n    So, $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots. Thus, it is possible for $k'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots.\n\n    For $k(x) = 0$ to have 9 roots, the graph of $k(x)$ must cross the x-axis 9 times. Since the leading term of $k(x)$ is $ap^3x^9$ with $ap^3 > 0$, $k(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $k(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$. If $k'(x)$ has 8 distinct roots, say $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_8$, then $k(x)$ has 8 local extrema at these points (4 local maxima and 4 local minima). For $k(x)$ to have 9 roots, the values of these local extrema must alternate in sign: $k(x_1) > 0, k(x_2) < 0, k(x_3) > 0, \\ldots, k(x_8) < 0$.\n\n4.  **Plausibility of Construction:**\n    There is no simple theorem that forbids the existence of such polynomials $f$ and $g$. The conditions for $f'$ and $g'$ to be positive are open conditions in the space of polynomial coefficients, meaning if they hold for a particular choice of coefficients, they also hold for small perturbations of those coefficients. It is a known result in polynomial dynamics that for any degrees $d_1, d_2 \\ge 2$, there exist polynomials $f_1, f_2$ of those degrees such that their composition has $d_1 d_2$ real fixed points. While these constructions (often based on Chebyshev polynomials) do not directly satisfy the positive derivative condition, they can be perturbed. The question of whether these perturbations can be made to satisfy the condition is more advanced, but it is believed to be possible. There is no apparent contradiction in assuming that polynomials $f$ and $g$ can be found that satisfy the given conditions and result in $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ having 9 real roots.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is the maximum number of real roots of a degree 9 polynomial, which is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
