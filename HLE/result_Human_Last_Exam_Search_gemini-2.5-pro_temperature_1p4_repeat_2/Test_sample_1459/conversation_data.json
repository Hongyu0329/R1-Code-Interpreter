    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ (with the standard absolute value metric) and the unit circle (with its intrinsic metric, where the circle has a circumference of $2\\pi$) has been calculated in specialized mathematical literature.\n\nThe definitive calculation is presented in the paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin. They provide a formula for the distance between a segment of length $\\lambda$ and the unit circle for $\\lambda \\le \\pi$.\n\nAccording to the main theorem of their paper, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by the expression $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\lambda-x)^2 + x^2}$, where $x$ is the unique solution to the equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi - \\lambda}{x} = \\frac{\\lambda - x}{\\sqrt{(\\lambda-x)^2+x^2}-x} $$\nFor the interval $$, we set $\\lambda=1$. The equation for $x$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi - 1}{x} = \\frac{1 - x}{\\sqrt{(1-x)^2+x^2}-x} $$\nThis equation does not have a simple algebraic solution for $x$. The value of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is therefore given by this implicit formula. The problem of computing this distance is noted to be a non-trivial task.\n\nAn upper bound for this distance can be found by constructing a specific correspondence. While not necessarily the exact value, some sources might present these simpler, though less precise, results. Other related research has established lower bounds for similar cases, for instance, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between an interval and the unit circle is known to be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\nHowever, the exact value is determined by the complex formula derived by Ji and Tuzhilin.\n\n<<<The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is given by $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(1-x)^2 + x^2}$, where $x$ is the unique solution in $(0, 1)$ to the equation $\\frac{\\pi - 1}{x} = \\frac{1 - x}{\\sqrt{(1-x)^2+x^2}-x}$."
