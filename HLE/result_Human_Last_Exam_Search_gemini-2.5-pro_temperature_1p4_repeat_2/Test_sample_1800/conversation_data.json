    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles are recognized for their significant catalytic potential in both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS) processes. However, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance is not a single definitive value but rather depends on the specific reaction, operating conditions, and the precise nature of the catalyst.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nThe optimal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting is multifaceted, as the process involves two distinct half-reactions: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).\n\nFor the overall water-splitting reaction, computational studies have suggested that Ni-Ceria nanoparticles with a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** exhibit favorable adsorption energy and electronic properties, indicating strong catalytic potential.\n\nWhen considering the specific half-reactions:\n\n*   **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** In a study of Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts, the optimal performance for HER was achieved with a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2, which corresponds to a **Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5**.\n\n*   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** For the OER, research on Ni<sub>y</sub>Ce₁₀₀₋<sub>y</sub>O<sub>x</sub> electrocatalysts has shown that catalysts with a **Ni/Ce ratio of 75:25 (or 3:1)** and **50:50 (or 1:1)** possess a larger electrochemically active surface area and lower Tafel slope, which are indicative of enhanced catalytic activity.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, various Ni/Ce ratios have been reported to yield high activity and stability. The optimal ratio can also be influenced by the specific reaction conditions and whether it is the forward or reverse WGS reaction.\n\n*   One study found that a catalyst with **15 wt% NiO on CeO₂** was both highly active and stable for CO oxidation, a related reaction.\n*   For the reverse Water Gas Shift (rWGS) reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of around **7% molar** has been identified.\n*   Other research indicates that Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with a nickel content ranging from **5 to 12.5 wt%** all demonstrate high specific activity for the WGS reaction between 300-450 °C.\n*   A comparative study also utilized a **40% Ni-ceria** catalyst, which showed good activity. Furthermore, another study reported effective catalysis using a **5% Ni loading** on doped ceria.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target application. For water splitting, ratios from **0.5 to 3 (Ni/Ce)** have been shown to be effective for different aspects of the process. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a broader range of nickel loading, from **5 wt% to 15 wt%**, has demonstrated high catalytic performance.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles depends on the specific catalytic application.
