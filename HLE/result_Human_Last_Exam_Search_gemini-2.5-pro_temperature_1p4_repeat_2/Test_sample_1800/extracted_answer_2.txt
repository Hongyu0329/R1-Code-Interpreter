The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles depends on the specific catalytic application. For water splitting, ratios between 0.5 and 3 (Ni/Ce) have shown promise for different aspects of the reaction. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a nickel loading in the range of 5 wt% to 15 wt% has been found to be highly effective.
