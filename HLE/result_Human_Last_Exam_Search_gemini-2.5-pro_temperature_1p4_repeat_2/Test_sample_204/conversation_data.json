    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, is a topological invariant that characterizes the mapping from three-dimensional space to the two-dimensional sphere. The Whitehead integral formula provides a method for calculating this charge.\n\nThe formula is given by:\nH = - (1 / (4π²)) ∫ A ⋅ B dV\nwhere the integration is over all of 3D space.\n\nIn this formula, the vector field **B** is the emergent magnetic field, calculated from the normalized vector field **n** = (nx, ny, nz) as:\nBᵢ = ½ εᵢⱼₖ **n** ⋅ (∂ⱼ**n** × ∂ₖ**n**)\nwhere εᵢⱼₖ is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nThe vector field **A** is the gauge potential, which is defined by the relation **B** = ∇ × **A**.\n\nThe specific vector field provided in the question is a well-known configuration called a Hopfion. For this type of structure, the Hopf charge is an integer that can be determined by the parameters defining the field.\n\nThe given vector field is:\nf = atan2(y, x)\nr2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)² + z²)\nG = PI * exp(-10 * r2)\nnx = sin(G) * cos(f)\nny = sin(G) * sin(f)\nnz = cos(G)\n\nThis represents a map from R³ to S² parameterized by the angles `G` and `f`. The structure of this field corresponds to a single Hopfion. A key characteristic of such a field is that preimages of any two distinct points on the sphere S² are closed loops in R³, and the linking number of these loops is equal to the Hopf charge.\n\nFor the given field, at the origin (x=0, y=0, z=0), we have `r2 = 0.5`, so `G = PI * exp(-5)`. As we move to infinity in any direction, `r2` approaches infinity, causing `G` to approach 0. The vector field smoothly transitions from a direction close to (0, 0, -1) near the core ring to (0, 0, 1) at infinity. The field twists in a way that corresponds to a single complete twist.\n\nThis specific configuration is a standard representation of a Hopfion with a Hopf charge of 1. Any field that can be continuously deformed into this one will have the same Hopf charge.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge of this vector field is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
