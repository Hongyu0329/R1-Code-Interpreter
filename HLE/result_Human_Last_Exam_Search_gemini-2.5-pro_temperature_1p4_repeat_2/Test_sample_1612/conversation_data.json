    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there have been 28 instances of a player winning the batting Triple Crown. This achievement requires a player to lead their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nThe total number of Triple Crown winners is 23, with four players having accomplished the feat more than once. This list includes players from the American League, National League, and the Negro Leagues, which were officially recognized as major leagues by MLB in 2020.\n\nRecent research and the inclusion of Negro League statistics have updated the historical records. Some of the notable Triple Crown winners include:\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012), who was the first player in 45 years to win the Triple Crown.\n*   **Ted Williams** and **Rogers Hornsby**, who each won the Triple Crown twice in the American and National Leagues, respectively.\n*   **Oscar Charleston**, who won the Triple Crown a record three times in the Negro Leagues.\n*   **Josh Gibson**, who won it twice in the Negro Leagues.\n\nBefore the official recognition of the Negro Leagues, it was cited that 10 players had won the Triple Crown 12 times in the American and National Leagues since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920. However, with the integration of Negro League records, the total number of recognized winners has increased.\n\n<<<23>>>"
