    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a calculation that relies on the periodicity of the tangent function and a high-precision value of pi.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the periodicity of the tangent function**: The tangent function, tan(x), has a period of π. This means that tan(x) = tan(x - nπ) for any integer n. To compute tan(10^100), we can first find the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\n2.  **Calculate the remainder**: We need to find `r = 10^100 mod π`. This can be expressed as `r = 10^100 - nπ`, where `n` is the integer `floor(10^100 / π)`. This remainder `r` will be a value between 0 and π.\n\n3.  **Relate to the fractional part**: The calculation of the remainder is equivalent to finding the fractional part of the division. Let `{x}` denote the fractional part of a number x. The remainder `r` can be calculated as `r = π * {10^100 / π}`.\n\n4.  **Use the decimal expansion of 1/π**: The fractional part `{10^100 / π}` is determined by the digits of the decimal expansion of 1/π. If the decimal expansion of 1/π is `0.d₁d₂d₃...`, then multiplying by 10^100 shifts the decimal point 100 places to the right. The fractional part of this new number is `0.d₁₀₁d₁₀₂d₁₀₃...`.\n\n5.  **Find the necessary digits**: To perform the calculation, we need the digits of 1/π starting from the 101st decimal place. The first few hundred digits of 1/π are known and can be found through scientific resources. The digits of 1/π starting from the 101st position are `4221813136...`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the argument of the tangent**: The fractional part we need is approximately `f ≈ 0.4221813136`. The argument of the tangent function, `r`, is then `r = π * f`. Using a precise value for π, this gives `r ≈ 3.1415926535 * 0.4221813136 ≈ 1.326337300`.\n\n7.  **Compute the final tangent value**: Finally, we calculate the tangent of this remainder (in radians): `tan(1.326337300)`. Using a calculator, the value is approximately 4.005001.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 005.\n\n<<<005>>>"
