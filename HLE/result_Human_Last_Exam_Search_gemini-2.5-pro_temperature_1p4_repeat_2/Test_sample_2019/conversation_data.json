    "I have been unable to find a definitive, pre-calculated answer to the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard through my searches.\n\nWhile the n-queens problem on a toroidal board is a known mathematical topic, and it is established that a solution for 5 queens on a 5x5 board exists, the specific enumeration for placing *four* queens is not readily available in the general search results.\n\nThe most promising source identified is the book \"Non-attacking chess pieces\" by Vaclav Kotesovec, which likely contains this specific information. However, I was unable to access the contents of this book to retrieve the answer. Similarly, my search of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) did not yield a sequence corresponding to this particular problem.\n\nWithout access to this specialized literature or the ability to perform a computational analysis, I cannot provide the exact number of ways.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a final answer.>>>"
