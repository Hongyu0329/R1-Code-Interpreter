(a) Diversity Order:**
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_a$ is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_b$ is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is **2**.

**(b) Maximum Directivity:**
*   Code **$\mathbf{S}_c$** provides the maximum diversity order (full diversity of 2), which is the key performance metric. It is the code that offers the best performance in combating fading.
