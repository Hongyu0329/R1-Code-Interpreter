    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G_0, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to many-body theory. The bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum representation is given by the following expression:\n\n<br>\n***G<sub>0</sub>(k,ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ<sub>k</sub> + iη)***\n<br>\n\nHere:\n*   **G_0(k,ω)** is the bare Green's function for a particle with momentum **k** and energy (or frequency) **ω**.\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum **k**. This is the energy of the particle in the absence of any interactions.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimal positive imaginary number that ensures the causal nature of the Green's function, dictating the time-ordering of events. The sign of this term determines whether the Green's function is retarded or advanced.\n\nThis relationship demonstrates that the bare Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In other words, the function diverges when the energy of the propagating particle, ω, is equal to its intrinsic energy, ϵ_k. These poles in the Green's function correspond to the energies of the stable, non-interacting particles.\n\nFor a system of fermions at a finite temperature, the expression is often written in terms of Matsubara frequencies (iω_n):\n\n<br>\n***G<sub>0</sub>(k, iω<sub>n</sub>) = 1 / (iω<sub>n</sub> - (ϵ<sub>k</sub> - µ))***\n<br>\n\nIn this formulation:\n*   **iω_n** is the fermionic Matsubara frequency, given by iω_n = i(2n+1)πk_BT, where n is an integer, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n*   **µ** is the chemical potential.\n\nIn a more general basis where the non-interacting Hamiltonian H_0 is diagonal with eigenvalues ϵ_i, the bare Green's function takes a simple diagonal form.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 exhibits an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum representation, this is expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη), where ω is the frequency and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. This means the Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. For fermionic systems at finite temperature, this is often written using Matsubara frequencies as G_0(k, iω_n) = 1 / (iω_n - (ϵ_k - µ)), where iω_n are the discrete imaginary frequencies and µ is the chemical potential. In a basis that diagonalizes the non-interacting Hamiltonian, the Green's function is a diagonal matrix with elements G_0,ij(ω) = δ_ij / (ω - ϵ_i), explicitly showing the inverse relationship with the energy eigenvalues of each state."
