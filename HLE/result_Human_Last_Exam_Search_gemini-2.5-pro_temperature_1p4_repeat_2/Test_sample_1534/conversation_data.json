    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the main palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe brain of the dwarf cuttlefish is a complex structure with numerous lobes. The palliovisceral lobe is part of a larger group of lobes known as the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is involved in controlling locomotion. A three-dimensional brain atlas created for the dwarf cuttlefish reveals the specific arrangement of these structures.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe complex itself is composed of several parts:\n*   Palliovisceral lobe (PV)\n*   Lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes (LPV)\n*   Fin lobes (F)\n*   Posterior chromatophore lobes (PCL)\n*   Dorsal vasomotor lobe (DV)\n*   Ventral vasomotor lobe (VV)\n\nBased on 3D reconstructions of the dwarf cuttlefish brain, the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are positioned towards the rear of the palliovisceral lobe. The posterior chromatophore lobes are involved in controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass. The fin lobes are responsible for the movement of the cuttlefish's fins. The entire brain is encased on its posterior side by rigid cartilage. Studies on the closely related *Sepia officinalis* also describe a similar arrangement within the posterior subesophageal mass, where the posterior chromatophore lobes and fin lobes are distinct components alongside the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
