    "I have started by searching for the Gauss class number problem and related concepts like fundamental discriminants and class numbers. The search results provide a good overview of the problem, explaining that for any given class number, there are only a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields (and thus a finite number of negative fundamental discriminants) with that class number.\n\nThe initial searches did not directly provide a list of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48. However, they pointed towards resources like class number tables and computational algebra systems that might contain this information. The next step should be to find a comprehensive list or a computational tool to find the required information.\n\nI have found a very relevant document. Specifically, a table within a paper by Mark Watkins from the University of Sydney, which lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for given class numbers. This table explicitly states the number for class number 48. This seems to be the most direct and reliable source to answer the user's question.In the context of the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 has been determined through extensive computations. For a given class number *n*, the problem seeks to find all imaginary quadratic fields (and their corresponding negative fundamental discriminants) that have that class number.\n\nBased on tables compiled by mathematicians working on this problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 243. These tables are the result of significant computational efforts to solve the class number problem for various class numbers.\n\n<<<243>>>"
