There is no single precise value; the value of the critical exponent ν depends on the system's universality class, primarily determined by its spatial dimension (d) and the symmetry of its order parameter (N). The most common values are ν = 1/2 (for d ≥ 4), ν ≈ 0.630 (for d=3, N=1), ν ≈ 0.671 (for d=3, N=2), and ν = 1 (for d=2, N=1).
