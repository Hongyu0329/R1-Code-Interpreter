    "The initial search has confirmed that the oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is determined by the amino acid sequence, specifically the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat. The work of Harbury et al. is seminal in this field, demonstrating that mutating these core hydrophobic residues in the GCN4 leucine zipper can switch the protein between dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric states.\n\nThe search results did not directly provide the oligomeric states for the exact sequences in the question. However, one of the search results, the source code for a bioinformatics tool called 'isambard', contains sequences that are highly similar to those in the question. This suggests the sequences are from a known study and are used as examples. Specifically, result lists:\n- A tetramer with the sequence: `ELAAIKQELAAIKKELAAIKWELAAIKQ`. This is very similar to sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`. The key features (Isoleucine at 'a' positions and a Trp insertion) are present.\n- It also refers to CC-Di, CC-Tri, and CC-Tet as designed parallel oligomers.\n\nI need to find the original publication that describes these specific sequences and their experimentally determined oligomeric states. The reference to Harbury et al. (1993) is frequent, and I should check that paper for the sequences. The similarity to the 'isambard' examples is a strong lead. I will refine my search to find the paper by the Woolfson group, which designed the \"SOP\" (Standard Oligomer Panel) or similar sets of peptides, as this seems to be the origin of these sequences based on the 'isambard' code's naming scheme (e.g., 'CC-Tet').\n\nI will perform a new search to pinpoint the exact paper and the oligomeric states of the listed peptides.The searches have pointed towards designed coiled-coils as the source of these sequences. The work of Harbury and Woolfson is central to this field. The \"isambard\" source code provided a crucial hint, linking a sequence highly similar to peptide 3 with a tetramer (CC-Tet). Further searches for designed coiled-coil trimers and tetramers have brought up relevant papers. However, I have not yet found a single paper that lists all five of these exact sequences and their corresponding oligomeric states. It's highly probable that these sequences come from a specific study or a set of related studies on de novo protein design that systematically varied the core residues to control oligomerization. I need to consolidate the information and try to match each sequence to a described design principle (e.g., placement of I, L, W at 'a' and 'd' positions) to deduce its oligomeric state based on the literature. I will perform one more targeted search focusing on the likely source of these peptides, the Woolfson lab's \"SOP\" (Standardised Oligomer Panel) or similar de novo designed peptide sets, to find the definitive answers.The oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is primarily determined by the nature and packing of amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the `abcdefg` heptad repeat. The sequences provided are characteristic of de novo designed peptides, likely from studies aimed at establishing rules for protein oligomerization. The work from the laboratories of Harbury, Alber, and particularly Woolfson, provides the basis for determining the state of each sequence.\n\nBased on the established design principles from these and other studies, the oligomeric state of each peptide can be determined:\n\n1.  **`EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**: This sequence is a variant of the de novo designed peptide CC-Di from the Woolfson group. It is based on an Isoleucine-Leucine (`I-L`) core at the 'a' and 'd' positions, respectively. The key feature is the single Asparagine (`N`) in the core (`...ENA...`). A buried polar Asn residue at an 'a' position strongly specifies the formation of a parallel **dimer (2)**.\n\n2.  **`EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**: This peptide has Isoleucine (I) at both the 'a' and 'd' positions. While the original work by Harbury showed that an `I-I` core favored a trimeric state, this specific sequence is based on the \"CC-Tet\" design from the Woolfson laboratory's basis set of peptides. This sequence was specifically designed and intended to form a **tetramer (4)**, even though it was later found to be a mixture of states and was improved with a subsequent CC-Tet* design. For the purpose of identifying the intended design, it is considered a tetramer.\n\n3.  **`EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**: The heptad repeat for this sequence places Isoleucine at the 'a' position and a mix of polar (Q, K) and bulky hydrophobic (W) residues at the 'd' position. This design is most consistent with that of a **dimer (2)**. The `I-L` core pattern is generally dimeric, and the polar substitutions at the 'd' position do not universally drive higher-order oligomerization in this context.\n\n4.  **`EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**: This peptide features an Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and a beta-branched Threonine (T) at the 'd' position. The packing of beta-branched residues in the core is a critical determinant of the oligomeric state. While similar sequences have been shown to form pentamers in some studies, this specific `I(a)-T(d)` packing arrangement is also known to favor the formation of a **trimer (3)**.\n\n5.  **`EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**: The underlying pattern here is an Isoleucine at the 'a' position and an Alanine at the 'd' position (`I-A` core), which strongly favors a dimeric structure. The substitutions at the 'd' position with Q, K, and the bulky W are variations on this dimeric theme. Despite the potential for W to promote trimerization, the overall sequence context is most predictive of a **dimer (2)**.\n\nCompiling the states in the order presented in the question gives the sequence:\n1. `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK` -> **2**\n2. `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ` -> **2**\n3. `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ` -> **4**\n4. `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK` -> **2**\n5. `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK` -> **3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers 2, 2, 4, 2, 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
