    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic ring closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, specifically the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n**1. Application of Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory**\n\nDeca-2,4,6,8-tetraene possesses four π-bonds, meaning it is an 8-π-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a thermal electrocyclic reaction, a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 in this case) undergoes a conrotatory ring closure. This is because the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of an 8-π-electron system (ψ₄) has a C₂ symmetry, where the lobes of the p-orbitals at the termini of the conjugated system must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to achieve a bonding (in-phase) overlap to form the new sigma bond.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Analysis**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the mode of ring closure (conrotatory). We can determine the outcome by analyzing the geometry of the terminal double bonds of the reacting polyene system, which are at the C2 and C8 positions.\n\n*   The double bond at C2 has a **(Z)** configuration. We can classify this as a \"cis\" type terminus.\n*   The double bond at C8 has an **(E)** configuration. We can classify this as a \"trans\" type terminus.\n\nFor a system with one \"cis\" and one \"trans\" terminus that undergoes a conrotatory ring closure, the resulting substituents on the newly formed sigma bond will be **cis** to each other. Therefore, the FMO-allowed product for the cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is the **cis-isomer A** (*cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene). Experimental results confirm that this reaction is highly stereospecific and yields the cis-isomer.\n\n**3. Origin and Ratio of the Two Isomers**\n\nThe question states that two products are formed: the *cis*-isomer A and the *trans*-isomer B. While the direct, FMO-allowed pathway for the given reactant leads exclusively to the cis-isomer A, the formation of the trans-isomer B can be explained by a competing reaction pathway under the thermal conditions.\n\nA plausible explanation is the isomerization of the starting material. Under thermal conditions, the (8E) double bond can potentially isomerize to a (8Z) configuration, establishing an equilibrium between two reactant isomers:\n\n1.  **(Reactant E):** \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene\n2.  **(Reactant Z):** \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene\n\nReactant Z, which has \"cis\" type termini at both C2 and C8, would also undergo a conrotatory ring closure. For a \"cis,cis\" system, the conrotatory motion leads to a **trans** product. Thus, Reactant Z cyclizes to form the **trans-isomer B** (*trans*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene).\n\nThe final ratio of products A:B is determined by the Curtin-Hammett principle. It depends on the equilibrium constant between Reactant E and Reactant Z, and the respective rates of their cyclization (kₑ and kₐ).\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** The (E)-isomer of a substituted alkene is generally more thermodynamically stable than the (Z)-isomer due to reduced steric strain. Therefore, at equilibrium, the concentration of Reactant E will be significantly higher than that of Reactant Z.\n*   **Reaction Rates:** Both cyclizations are FMO-allowed conrotatory processes, so their rate constants (kₑ and kₐ) are expected to be of a similar magnitude.\n\nSince the major component at equilibrium (Reactant E) leads to the cis-isomer A, and the minor component (Reactant Z) leads to the trans-isomer B, the cis-product will be the major product.\n\n**Prediction of the Ratio**\n\nThe ratio of A:B will be significantly greater than 1, favoring isomer A. The exact ratio depends on the energy difference between the E and Z isomers and the reaction temperature. For a typical energy difference of about 1-2 kcal/mol, the ratio of A:B would be in the range of approximately 5:1 to 50:1 at common reaction temperatures. FMO theory, therefore, predicts that while both may be formed, the reaction will show a strong preference for the formation of the *cis*-isomer A.\n\n<<<The ratio of A to B is predicted to be significantly greater than 1, with A being the major product and B being the minor product."
