    "Without the influence of the Norse invasions and the subsequent interaction with Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely have evolved into something like **\"swester\"** or **\"suster.\"** This conclusion is based on the phonetic journey the Old English word *sweostor* would have probably taken.\n\nThe original Old English word for a female sibling was *sweostor*. This term, with variations like *swustor* and *swester* in different dialects, was a direct descendant of the Proto-Germanic *swestÄ“r. The modern word \"sister\" as we know it is a hybrid, a result of the Old English *sweostor* being influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*. The key change introduced by the Norse was the \"i\" vowel sound, which replaced the native Old English \"eo\" or \"u\" sound in the first syllable.\n\nTo understand what *sweostor* would have become without this Norse influence, we need to trace its likely phonological development through Middle English and into Modern English, considering established sound changes:\n\n*   **The \"eo\" Diphthong:** The Old English diphthong \"eo\" in unstressed syllables generally did not survive into Middle English. In many cases, it was simplified to a single vowel sound, often \"e\". For example, the Old English *heorte* (heart) became *herte* in Middle English. Following this pattern, *sweostor* would have likely seen its \"eo\" sound simplify.\n\n*   **Vowel Reduction in Unstressed Syllables:** The second, unstressed vowel in *sweostor* would have been subject to reduction, a common process in the transition to Middle English where unstressed vowels often merged into a schwa sound (like the 'a' in \"sofa\"), typically written as \"e\".\n\n*   **Simplification of the \"sw\" Cluster:** The initial \"sw\" consonant cluster was generally stable in English and would have likely remained.\n\n*   **Middle English Forms:** Taking these changes into account, *sweostor* would have likely evolved into forms such as *swester* or *suster* in Middle English. The form *suster* was indeed a common Middle English variant, showing a natural phonetic evolution from the Old English *swustor* dialectal form.\n\n*   **The Great Vowel Shift and Beyond:** The Great Vowel Shift, a major series of changes in the pronunciation of English long vowels, primarily affected stressed syllables and thus would have had a minimal direct impact on the pronunciation of a word like *swester* or *suster*.\n\nTherefore, without the Scandinavian influence that introduced the \"i\" sound, the native word would have continued its natural phonetic development. The most probable modern form would be a direct descendant of the Middle English *swester* or *suster*. It's worth noting that the German word for sister is *Schwester* and the Dutch is *zuster*, both of which are closely related and demonstrate a similar evolutionary path from the same Proto-Germanic root.\n\n<<<swester or suster>>>"
