    "The puzzle is solved by identifying a transformation rule that is consistently applied to all input examples. The rule operates on a grid of numbers derived from the input strings.\n\n### The Transformation Rule\n\n1.  **Identify the '2':** Locate the cell containing the number `2` in the grid.\n2.  **Find the Target '0':** The `2` will move to one of its eight neighboring cells that contains a `0`. The specific neighbor is chosen based on a fixed directional priority.\n3.  **Directional Priority:** The directions are checked in the following order:\n    1.  North-East (NE)\n    2.  North-West (NW)\n    3.  South-East (SE)\n    4.  South-West (SW)\n    5.  North (N)\n    6.  East (E)\n    7.  South (S)\n    8.  West (W)\n4.  **Execute the Move:**\n    *   The value of the cell originally containing `2` is changed to `0`.\n    *   The value of the first neighboring cell found to contain a `0` (based on the priority list) is changed to `2`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Examples\n\n*   **For Input_A:** The `2` is at `(1,1)`.\n    *   The NE neighbor's value is `1`.\n    *   The NW neighbor at `(0,0)` has a value of `0`. This is the first match in the priority list.\n    *   Therefore, the `2` at `(1,1)` becomes `0`, and the `0` at `(0,0)` becomes `2`.\n    *   This results in `Output_A`: `'201111,101111,111111'`.\n\n*   **For Input_B:** The `2` is at `(3,6)`.\n    *   The NE neighbor at `(2,7)` has a value of `0`. This is the first match in the priority list.\n    *   Therefore, the `2` at `(3,6)` becomes `0`, and the `0` at `(2,7)` becomes `2`.\n    *   This results in `Output_B`: `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, we apply the same rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   The grid is:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The `2` is located at position `(1,4)`.\n*   We check its neighbors based on the priority:\n    1.  The NE neighbor at `(0,5)` contains a `0`. This is the first match.\n*   The transformation is:\n    *   The `2` at `(1,4)` becomes `0`.\n    *   The `0` at `(0,5)` becomes `2`.\n*   The resulting grid is:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 2\n    0 1 1 1 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   Converting this grid back to the string format gives the value for MISSING.\n\n`'000002,011100,111111'`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
