    "An analysis of the chess position with the FEN `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1` reveals that White has a winning advantage due to the passed d-pawn. To secure the win, White must navigate the threats posed by the black queen.\n\nWhite's queen on f2 is currently attacked by the black queen on c5. A simple queen exchange with `1. Qxc5+ kxc5` would lead to a lost endgame for White, as the black king is active enough to stop the d-pawn, while the white king is too far away.\n\nThe optimal move for White is one that improves the king's safety while maintaining the threat of the passed pawn.\n\nBy moving the king to g2, White prepares to meet a queen exchange on f2 with a recapture by the king. After `1. Kg2 Qxf2+ 2. Kxf2`, the resulting pawn endgame is winning for White. The white king can support the advance of the d-pawn, which Black will be unable to stop.\n\nIf Black chooses not to exchange queens after `1. Kg2`, for example with `1...Ka6`, White can continue to press the advantage with moves like `2. Qf8+`, further displacing the black king and preparing to advance the d-pawn to promotion.\n\nTherefore, the best move for White is `Kg2`.\n\n<<<Kg2>>>"
