    "Two Nobel laureates, physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen, were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for the Enron Corporation under the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the theory of elementary particles, is seen in one of the advertisements. In the commercial, he speaks about the necessity of questioning and shedding inherited ideas to make progress.\n\nThe other Nobel laureate featured in the campaign was Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. He was identified as the \"Indian commentator\" seen in the commercials.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign, created by the advertising agency Conquest, was a series of television spots that presented Enron as a forward-thinking and innovative company. The commercials featured various accomplished individuals, with the tagline becoming deeply ironic in retrospect after the company's massive corporate fraud and collapse came to light in 2001.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
