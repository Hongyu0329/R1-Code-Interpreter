    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1 in Schoenflies notation. This is based on the data from the website \"packomania.com\" by Eckard Specht, which is a comprehensive resource for the best-known circle packings. The table on this website lists the properties of these packings, including their symmetry group. For entries where the symmetry group is not explicitly stated, it is implied to be C_1, which represents the lowest order of symmetry (asymmetry). The data snippet for 1135 circles does not specify a symmetry group, leading to the conclusion that it is C_1.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
