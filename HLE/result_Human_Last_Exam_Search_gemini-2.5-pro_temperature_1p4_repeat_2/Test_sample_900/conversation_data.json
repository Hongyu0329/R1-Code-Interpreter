    "There is no such thing as a \"pas de Balanchine\" in the official lexicon of ballet terminology. Therefore, Svetlana Gileva performed zero pas de Balanchine in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\"\n\nWhile the term has gained some informal currency on social media platforms like TikTok, it does not refer to a recognized ballet step. The phrase is sometimes used to describe a short, fan-created dance sequence or to refer generally to the neoclassical style of choreographer George Balanchine.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreographic style, particularly in works like \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" is heavily influenced by Balanchine's innovations. Critics note that his work pulls from and extends classical ballet traditions. However, there is no formally designated step within his choreography called a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\nReviews of the Semperoper Ballett's 2015 production and of Svetlana Gileva's performance in the \"Jete Woman\" role do not mention this term. They focus on the overall athletic, deconstructed, and virtuosic nature of Forsythe's choreography.\n\nGiven that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized ballet step, it is not possible to count its performance in this or any other professional ballet production.\n\n<<<0>>>"
