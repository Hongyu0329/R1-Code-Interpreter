    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to define the group and the concept of a power subgroup.\n\n### The Semidihedral Group SD_512\nThe semidihedral group of order 2<sup>n</sup>, denoted SD<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub>, can be defined by the presentation:\nG = < r, s | r<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup>-1</sup> >.\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have 2<sup>n</sup> = 512, so n = 9. The group, which we will denote as G = SD<sub>512</sub>, has the following presentation:\nG = < r, s | r<sup>256</sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>127</sup> >\n\nThe elements of G are of the form r<sup>i</sup> and sr<sup>j</sup> for 0 ≤ i, j < 256.\n\n### Power Subgroups\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup of the form G<sup>k</sup> for some integer k. G<sup>k</sup> is defined as the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G:\nG<sup>k</sup> = < g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G >\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form G<sup>k</sup>. Note that G<sup>-k</sup> = G<sup>k</sup>, so we only need to consider non-negative integers k.\n\nWe analyze the structure of G<sup>k</sup> based on the value of k.\n\n#### Case 1: k is an odd integer\nIf k is an odd number, then the mapping x ↦ x<sup>k</sup> is a permutation on any cyclic group of 2-power order.\nLet's check the generators of G. Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256) = 1. Therefore, there exists an integer l such that kl ≡ 1 (mod 256). The element r can be written as r = r<sup>kl</sup> = (r<sup>l</sup>)<sup>k</sup>, which means r is in G<sup>k</sup>.\nAlso, s<sup>k</sup> = s since k is odd and s has order 2.\nSince both generators r and s are in G<sup>k</sup>, the subgroup generated by them, which is G itself, must be a subgroup of G<sup>k</sup>. As G<sup>k</sup> is a subgroup of G, we must have G<sup>k</sup> = G.\nSo, for any odd integer k, we get only one power subgroup, which is G itself.\n\n#### Case 2: k is an even integer\nLet k be an even integer. We can write k = 2<sup>m</sup> * l, where m ≥ 1 and l is an odd integer.\nThe subgroup G<sup>k</sup> is generated by the set { g<sup>k</sup> | g ∈ G }. Let's find the k-th powers of the elements of G.\n\n1.  For elements of the form r<sup>i</sup>:\n    (r<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = r<sup>ik</sup> = r<sup>i * 2<sup>m</sup> * l</sup>. The subgroup generated by these elements is <r<sup>k</sup>>. Since l is odd, <r<sup>k</sup>> = <r<sup>2<sup>m</sup>*l</sup>> = <r<sup>2<sup>m</sup></sup>>.\n\n2.  For elements of the form sr<sup>j</sup>:\n    We first calculate the square of such an element:\n    (sr<sup>j</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = sr<sup>j</sup>sr<sup>j</sup>. From the relation srs = r<sup>127</sup>, we have sr = r<sup>127</sup>s. This implies sr<sup>j</sup>s = (srs)<sup>j</sup> = (r<sup>127</sup>)<sup>j</sup> = r<sup>127j</sup>.\n    So, (sr<sup>j</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = (sr<sup>j</sup>s)r<sup>j</sup> = r<sup>127j</sup>r<sup>j</sup> = r<sup>128j</sup>.\n    Since k is even, k=2p where p = k/2 = 2<sup>m-1</sup>l.\n    (sr<sup>j</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = ((sr<sup>j</sup>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>p</sup> = (r<sup>128j</sup>)<sup>p</sup> = r<sup>128jp</sup> = r<sup>128j * 2<sup>m-1</sup>l</sup> = r<sup>j * 2<sup>7</sup> * 2<sup>m-1</sup> * l</sup> = r<sup>j * l * 2<sup>m+6</sup></sup>.\n    The subgroup generated by these elements is <r<sup>l * 2<sup>m+6</sup></sup>>. Since l is odd, this is the same as <r<sup>2<sup>m+6</sup></sup>>.\n\nCombining these, G<sup>k</sup> = G<sup>2<sup>m</sup>l</sup> is generated by <r<sup>2<sup>m</sup></sup>> and <r<sup>2<sup>m+6</sup></sup>>.\nG<sup>k</sup> = < r<sup>2<sup>m</sup></sup>, r<sup>2<sup>m+6</sup></sup> >\nSince m ≥ 1, we have m+6 > m. Therefore, the subgroup <r<sup>2<sup>m+6</sup></sup>> is contained within <r<sup>2<sup>m</sup></sup>>.\nThus, for any even k = 2<sup>m</sup>l, G<sup>k</sup> = <r<sup>2<sup>m</sup></sup>>.\n\nThe distinct subgroups are determined by the value of m. The order of r is 256 = 2<sup>8</sup>.\nThe possible values for m are:\n*   m = 1 (e.g., k=2, 6, 10...): G<sup>2</sup> = <r<sup>2</sup>> (cyclic group of order 128)\n*   m = 2 (e.g., k=4, 12, 20...): G<sup>4</sup> = <r<sup>4</sup>> (cyclic group of order 64)\n*   m = 3 (e.g., k=8, 24, 40...): G<sup>8</sup> = <r<sup>8</sup>> (cyclic group of order 32)\n*   m = 4 (e.g., k=16, 48...): G<sup>16</sup> = <r<sup>16</sup>> (cyclic group of order 16)\n*   m = 5 (e.g., k=32, 96...): G<sup>32</sup> = <r<sup>32</sup>> (cyclic group of order 8)\n*   m = 6 (e.g., k=64, 192...): G<sup>64</sup> = <r<sup>64</sup>> (cyclic group of order 4)\n*   m = 7 (e.g., k=128, 384...): G<sup>128</sup> = <r<sup>128</sup>> (cyclic group of order 2)\n*   m = 8 (e.g., k=256, 768...): G<sup>256</sup> = <r<sup>256</sup>> = {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nFor m > 8, the resulting subgroup is still the trivial subgroup. G<sup>0</sup> is also the trivial subgroup.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512 is:\n1.  G (for any odd k)\n2.  <r<sup>2</sup>>\n3.  <r<sup>4</sup>>\n4.  <r<sup>8</sup>>\n5.  <r<sup>16</sup>>\n6.  <r<sup>32</sup>>\n7.  <r<sup>64</sup>>\n8.  <r<sup>128</sup>>\n9.  {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese are 9 distinct subgroups. Therefore, there are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
