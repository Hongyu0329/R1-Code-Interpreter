    "To determine the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, we first need to identify the fundamental group itself.\n\nLet $K_5$ denote the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil in $S^4$. The complement of this knotted surface, $S^4 \\setminus K_5$, is a fiber bundle over the circle $S^1$. The fiber is the punctured 5-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot. Let's denote the (un-punctured) 5-fold cover as $M_5$.\n\nA key result by Zeeman shows that for the 5-twist-spun trefoil, the fundamental group of the complement is a direct product. Specifically, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5)$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the fundamental group of the fiber and the fundamental group of the base space, $S^1$:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5) \\cong \\pi_1(M_5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe manifold $M_5$, the 5-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot, is a well-known space: it is the Poincar√© homology sphere (or dodecahedral space). Its fundamental group is the binary icosahedral group, often denoted as $I^*$ or $SL(2,5)$, which has an order of 120.\nThus, the fundamental group of the complement is:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5) \\cong I^* \\times \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nNext, we consider the double branched cover of $S^4$ over $K_5$. Let's call this 4-manifold $X$. The fundamental group of the double branched cover, $\\pi_1(X)$, is obtained by taking the fundamental group of the complement and quotienting by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element. A meridian of $K_5$ corresponds to a generator of the $\\mathbb{Z}$ factor in the direct product.\n\nLet $t$ be a generator for the $\\mathbb{Z}$ factor. Then the fundamental group of the double branched cover is:\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong (I^* \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle t^2 = 1 \\rangle$\n\nSince this is a direct product, the relation only affects the $\\mathbb{Z}$ component, turning it into $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2). Therefore, the fundamental group is:\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong I^* \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe final step is to determine the minimal number of generators for the finite group $I^* \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. For a finite group $G$, the minimal number of generators, denoted $d(G)$, is equal to the minimal number of generators of its quotient by the Frattini subgroup, $d(G/\\Phi(G))$.\n\nThe Frattini subgroup has the property that $\\Phi(G_1 \\times G_2) = \\Phi(G_1) \\times \\Phi(G_2)$ for finite groups.\n1.  The Frattini subgroup of $I^* = SL(2,5)$ is its center, $Z(I^*) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n2.  The Frattini subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the trivial group, $\\{e\\}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\Phi(I^* \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\Phi(I^*) \\times \\Phi(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\{e\\}$.\nThe quotient group is $(I^* \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2) / (\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\{e\\}) \\cong (I^*/\\mathbb{Z}_2) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe group $I^*/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is isomorphic to the icosahedral group $A_5$, which is the alternating group on 5 letters. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of generators for $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nA set of elements generates a finite group if and only if it is not contained in any maximal subgroup of the group. The maximal subgroups of $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ are of the form $M \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $A_5$, or $A_5 \\times N$, where $N$ is a maximal subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The maximal subgroups of $A_5$ are $A_4$, $D_{10}$ (dihedral group of order 10), and $S_3$ (symmetric group on 3 letters).\n*   The only maximal subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThis gives the following list of maximal subgroups of $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n*   $A_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $D_{10} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$\n\nWe seek the smallest set of elements that is not contained in any of these subgroups. Consider the set of two elements $\\{ ((1,2,3), h), ((1,2,3,4,5), e) \\}$, where $h$ is the non-trivial element of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   This set is not in $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$ because the first element has a non-trivial second component.\n*   The set of first components, $\\{ (1,2,3), (1,2,3,4,5) \\}$, generates $A_5$. Since this set of first components is not contained in any maximal subgroup of $A_5$ (like $A_4$, $D_{10}$, or $S_3$), the full set of elements cannot be contained in $A_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, $D_{10} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$, or $S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nSince this set of two elements is not contained within any maximal subgroup, it generates the entire group $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. A single element cannot generate this non-cyclic group. Thus, the minimal number of generators is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
