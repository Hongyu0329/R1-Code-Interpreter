    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four distinct colors: white (which can also appear yellow), red, black, and violet.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that can be colorless or white. It often takes on a yellow appearance due to impurities or exposure to light, which causes a slow transformation into red phosphorus. For this reason, it is sometimes also referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus has a deep red color, though its appearance can range from reddish-violet to a dark red. It is an amorphous or crystalline solid and is more stable than white phosphorus.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form of the element and has a black, flaky appearance with a metallic luster, similar to graphite.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a distinct crystalline form of phosphorus that is typically described as being violet or having a purple-red to red-brown hue.\n\nAnother allotrope, blue phosphorus, has been synthesized more recently. However, the name \"blue\" refers to its electronic band gap properties rather than its macroscopic color. It is typically produced as a two-dimensional material on a substrate, and there is no clear evidence that a bulk, solid form of this allotrope has a distinct blue color. Similarly, diphosphorus is a gaseous form of the element at high temperatures and is not a stable solid allotrope under normal conditions.\n\nTherefore, the observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are white/yellow, red, black, and violet.\n\n<<<4>>>"
