    "In the 1997 film *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*), the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves to the United States to continue his studies. However, the specific US city to which he relocates is not mentioned in the film.\n\nPlot summaries of the movie consistently state that Tommaso leaves for \"America\" or \"the USA\" after high school, a move financed by his wealthy father. Despite numerous detailed accounts of the film's narrative and characters, there is no reference to a particular American city. Even in-depth reviews and screenplay information fail to specify his destination. Therefore, it can be concluded that this information is not part of the film's available details.\n\n<<<The specific US city is not mentioned in the movie.>>>"
