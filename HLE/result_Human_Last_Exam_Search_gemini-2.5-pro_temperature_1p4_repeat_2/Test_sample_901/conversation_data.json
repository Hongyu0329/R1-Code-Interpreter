    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is the *cis* isomer of 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), a strong, sterically bulky base. The solvent is tert-butyl alcohol.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n*   **Mechanism and Stereochemistry**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromine) and the beta-hydrogen being removed must be in an anti-periplanar (or trans-diaxial) arrangement.\n    *   For this to occur in a cyclohexane ring, both the bromine and the beta-hydrogen must be in axial positions.\n    *   The starting material, cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, must first adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is axial. In this conformation, the methyl group is equatorial.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev)**: There are two different types of beta-hydrogens that can be eliminated: one on carbon 2 (next to the methyl group) and one on carbon 6.\n    *   Elimination of the hydrogen from C2 would yield 1-methylcyclohexene, the more substituted and thermodynamically more stable product (Zaitsev product).\n    *   Elimination of the hydrogen from C6 would yield 3-methylcyclohexene, the less substituted and thermodynamically less stable product (Hofmann product).\n*   **Effect of the Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered proton on C2. It will, therefore, preferentially remove the more accessible proton on C6. This preference for the formation of the less-substituted alkene when using a bulky base is known as the Hofmann rule.\n\nTherefore, the preferential removal of a proton from C6 leads to the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene as the major product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
