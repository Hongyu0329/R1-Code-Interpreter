    "To determine the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, a step-by-step analysis of the properties of these mathematical objects is required.\n\nFirst, the conductor $d=53599$ must be factorized into its prime components. The prime factorization of 53599 is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. As this is a product of distinct primes, the conductor is a square-free integer.\n\nFor a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the prime $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if it is not the trivial character, which means its order must be greater than 1.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. Therefore, if $k_i$ is the order of $\\chi_i$, we must have $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\nThe order of any character modulo a prime $p$ must be a divisor of $\\phi(p) = p-1$. Let's check this for our primes:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$.\n\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, each individual order $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6. All the $p-1$ values are divisible by 6, so this is possible. Since the characters must be primitive, their orders must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each component character are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe number of characters modulo $p$ having a specific order $k$ (where $k | p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four prime factors, there are $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible characters whose order is in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nTo find the number of combinations of characters that result in an overall order of 6, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of ways to choose one character for each prime factor from the allowed set of orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $5^4 = 625$.\n\nFrom this total, we must subtract the combinations where the lcm is not 6. This occurs if the orders of all component characters are not multiples of 2, or not multiples of 3.\n1.  If no character's order is a multiple of 2, all orders must be 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters. This gives $2^4 = 16$ combinations. The resulting lcm would be 3.\n2.  If no character's order is a multiple of 3, all orders must be 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character. This gives $1^4 = 1$ combination. The resulting lcm would be 2.\n\nThese two sets of combinations are disjoint. Therefore, the number of combinations where the lcm is not 6 is $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nSubtracting these from the total gives the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $53599$ and order 6:\n$625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
