    # Inappropriate options based on Domain-Driven Design principles:
    # A: This is the "Fat Controller" anti-pattern. Controllers should delegate business logic, not contain it.
    # B: This is the "God Object" anti-pattern. The Order class would have too many responsibilities,
    #    violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
    # D: This leads to an "Anemic Domain Model," where domain objects are just data containers and all logic
    #    resides in services. This is a procedural approach, not an object-oriented one.
    
    # Appropriate options:
    # C: This approach creates a "Rich Domain Model" by placing logic within the most relevant entities.
    # E: This is a practical and robust approach, using entities for their intrinsic logic and services
    #    for orchestrating multiple entities or handling external concerns (like sending emails).
