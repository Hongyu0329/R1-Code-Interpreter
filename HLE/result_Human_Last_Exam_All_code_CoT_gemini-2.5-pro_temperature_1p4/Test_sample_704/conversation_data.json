    "In this solution, I will determine the colors that define the specified range and then use Sir Isaac Newton's correlation between the color spectrum and the musical scale to find the corresponding note.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start and End of the Range:**\n    *   The starting point of the range is the color produced by mixing yellow and blue. In subtractive color mixing (like pigments), this results in **Green**.\n    *   The end point of the range is explicitly stated as **Blue**.\n    *   Therefore, the range in question is from Green to Blue.\n\n2.  **Apply Newton's Color-Note Mapping:**\n    *   Newton associated the seven colors of the spectrum with the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. His mapping is as follows:\n        *   Red → C (Do)\n        *   Orange → D (Re)\n        *   Yellow → E (Mi)\n        *   **Green → F (Fa)**\n        *   **Blue → G (So)**\n        *   Indigo → A (La)\n        *   Violet → B (Ti)\n\n3.  **Determine the Note for the Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the note that corresponds to the range *between* Green and Blue. In Newton's circular diagram of colors, the colors are arranged in order. The segment for Blue directly follows the segment for Green. Therefore, the note for the range between Green and Blue is the note associated with the Blue segment itself.\n    *   Based on the mapping, the note for Blue is **G**.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through these steps to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_musical_note_from_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines a musical note based on a color range from Newton's color circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the start of the range by combining colors.\n    start_color_component1 = \"Yellow\"\n    start_color_component2 = \"Blue\"\n    start_color_result = \"Green\"\n    print(f\"First, determine the starting color of the range.\")\n    print(f\"The color produced by combining {start_color_component1} and {start_color_component2} is {start_color_result}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the end of the range.\n    end_color = \"Blue\"\n    print(f\"The end color of the range is {end_color}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Define Newton's mapping from colors to musical notes.\n    newton_color_to_note_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 4: Identify the final color and its corresponding note.\n    # The \"range between Green and Blue\" refers to the segment for Blue on the color circle.\n    final_color = end_color\n    final_note = newton_color_to_note_map[final_color]\n\n    print(\"In Newton's model, the range between one color and the next corresponds to the segment of the second color.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, we need to find the note for Blue.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # The final print statement showing the numbers/components of the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"({start_color_component1} + {start_color_component2}) -> {start_color_result}\")\n    print(f\"Range: between {start_color_result} and {end_color}\")\n    print(f\"Note({end_color}) = {final_note}\")\n\nfind_musical_note_from_color()\n<<<G>>>\n```"
