    "To determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death, we need to cross-reference their timelines.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death. She died of the plague.\n2.  Create a simplified timeline of Geoffrey Chaucer's known whereabouts and duties for the period around her death.\n3.  The program will then look up Chaucer's location for that specific year from the timeline data.\n4.  Finally, it will match the found location to the provided answer choices and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died\n    by cross-referencing historical data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    blanche_death_year = 1368\n\n    # Step 2: Create a simplified timeline of Chaucer's known locations.\n    # By 1367, Chaucer was an esquire in King Edward III's household, a position\n    # that based him in England, though it involved diplomatic travel.\n    # His major diplomatic missions to Italy and France occurred after 1368.\n    chaucer_timeline = {\n        1367: \"England\", # Appointed as an esquire to the royal court.\n        1368: \"England\", # In service to the King.
