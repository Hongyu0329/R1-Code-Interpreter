    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. To understand its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, it's easiest to work in the frequency-momentum $(\\omega, k)$ representation.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  State the theoretical formula for the bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$. This formula directly shows the relationship between $G_0$, the frequency $\\omega$, and the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The formula is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $\\eta$ is a small positive infinitesimal that ensures causality.\n2.  From this formula, we can see that the Green's function is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta)$. It has a pole near the real frequency axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$.\n3.  I will write a Python script to demonstrate this relationship. The script will define values for $\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, and $\\eta$, and then calculate the corresponding complex value for $G_0$.\n4.  The script will print out the equation with the numerical values substituted in, clearly showing how the inputs relate to the output, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef demonstrate_green_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for given parameters\n    and prints the functional relationship.\n\n    The bare Green's function (retarded) is defined as:\n    G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iη)\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        eta (float): A small positive infinitesimal for calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy ε_k is given by:\")\n    print(\"G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iη)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Let's demonstrate with a numerical example:\")\n    print(f\"  Frequency (ω) = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Energy Eigenvalue (ε_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal (η) = {eta}\\n\")\n    \n    # Calculate the denominator and the final G_0 value\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    G0_value = 1 / denominator\n\n    print(\"Substituting these values into the equation:\")\n    # Here we output each number in the final equation, as requested\n    print(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\n    print(f\"  G_0 = 1 / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"  G_0 = {G0_value}\")\n    print(f\"  G_0 ≈ {G0_value.real:.4f} + {G0_value.imag:.4f}i\")\n\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\n# You can change these values to see how G_0 changes\nexample_omega = 2.5\nexample_epsilon_k = 2.0\n\ndemonstrate_green_function(example_omega, example_epsilon_k)\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ of the form $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency and $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.>>>"
