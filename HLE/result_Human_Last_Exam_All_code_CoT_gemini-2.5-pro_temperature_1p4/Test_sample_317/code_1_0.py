    # Step 1: Define Burke's core distinction between Motion and Action.
    explanation_part_1 = (
        "In Kenneth Burke's philosophy, the primary distinction is between 'Motion' and 'Action'.\n"
        "- Motion: This is the realm of the non-symbolic, the purely physical and biological. A planet orbits, a "
        "body digests, a stone falls. There is no choice or morality here.\n"
        "- Action: This is the realm of the symbol-using animal (the human). It involves purpose, will, intention, "
        "and is governed by norms and morals. It is inherently symbolic."
    )

    # Step 2: Explain the role of the "Negative."
    explanation_part_2 = (
        "A cornerstone of 'Action' is the 'Negative.' Burke argues that the concept of 'no' or 'not' "
        "does not exist in nature (the realm of Motion). It is a purely linguistic, symbolic invention. "
        "The Negative makes prohibitions, commandments, and laws possible."
    )

    # Step 3: Connect the "Tribal No" to the concepts.
    explanation_part_3 = (
        "The 'Tribal No' refers to the foundational prohibitions and taboos of a society (e.g., 'Thou shalt not...'). "
        "Because these are commandments built upon the Negative—a symbolic construct that creates rules for "
        "behavior—they are firmly rooted in the realm of Action."
    )

    # Step 4: Evaluate the reasoning in the answer choices.
    explanation_part_4 = (
        "We have established the 'Tribal No' is Action. Now we evaluate the reason:\n"
        "- 'Rational' (Choice E): While action can be rational, Burke's emphasis is on the symbolic nature itself. "
        "The negative is pre-rational; it's the symbolic tool that makes certain kinds of reason possible.\n"
        "- 'Imaginal' (Choice A): This fits perfectly. The 'No' is not a physical or sensory thing. It is a concept "
        "created and sustained in the collective imagination through symbols and language. It is an imagined boundary "
        "on behavior. Therefore, the 'Tribal No' is an imaginal construct that enables symbolic action."
