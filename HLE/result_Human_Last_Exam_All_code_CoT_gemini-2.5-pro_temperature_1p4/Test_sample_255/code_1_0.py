    Calculates the dimension of the cohomology group H^2(G,M).
    
    The dimension is found using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the amalgamated
    free product G = <a,b | a^8 = b^8>. The dimension of H^2(G,M) is the
    dimension of the cokernel of the map H^1(H,M) + H^1(K,M) -> H^1(L,M).
    This equals dim(H^1(L,M)) - dim(Im(f)).
    The dimension of H^1 for a cyclic group acting via a permutation is the
    number of cycles, which can be found using gcd.
    The image of the map f has dimension 1.
