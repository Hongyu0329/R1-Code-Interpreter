    Calculates the smallest possible number of elements in the subset Y.

    The problem can be stated with the following parameters:
    n: dimension of the ambient vector space
    k: dimension of the subspaces in the set X

    The condition is: sum_{W in Y} (V intersect W) = V for any V in X.

    This problem has a dual formulation. The answer is d + 1, where d = n - k
    is the codimension of the subspaces.
