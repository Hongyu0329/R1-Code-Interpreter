# Number of pirates represents the number of vertices in the graph.
V = 9

# Number of pairs at gunpoint represents the number of edges in the graph.
E = 16

# The problem describes a connected graph. A "Mexican standoff" is interpreted as a
# fundamental cycle. The number of fundamental (or independent) cycles in a
# connected graph is given by its cyclomatic number, calculated as E - V + 1.

# Calculate the number of standoffs using the formula.
num_standoffs = E - V + 1

# Output the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.
