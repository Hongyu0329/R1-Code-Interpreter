---[ Question 1: Beta-1 Subunit Hotspots for Interaction with Alpha-1 Subunit ]---

Residue: Y213
  Function: Part of the 'floor' of the hydrophobic binding pocket, makes key
            contact with the AID helix from the alpha-1 subunit.
--------------------
Residue: W236
  Function: A critical tryptophan that forms a major part of the hydrophobic
            pocket wall, essential for high-affinity binding.
--------------------
Residue: I296
  Function: Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket, interacting with nonpolar
            residues of the AID helix.
--------------------
Residue: Y304
  Function: Another key aromatic residue in the hydrophobic pocket, providing
            significant binding energy through contacts.
--------------------
Residue: M311
  Function: A methionine residue lining the hydrophobic groove of the binding
            pocket.
--------------------
Residue: L332
  Function: Part of a leucine-rich motif that forms a crucial part of the
            hydrophobic binding interface.
--------------------
Residue: V333
  Function: Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket that cradles the alpha-1 AID
            helix.
--------------------
Residue: L335
  Function: Works with L332 to form a stable hydrophobic surface for interaction.
--------------------
Residue: R337
  Function: Forms a critical salt bridge with a conserved aspartate residue in the
            alpha-1 AID, anchoring the interaction.
--------------------


---[ Question 2: Beta-1 Subunit Hotspots for Gating Modulation of Alpha-1 Subunit ]---

Residue/Region: N-terminal region (residues ~1-30)
  Function: This variable region is known to directly influence channel
              inactivation properties, a key aspect of gating.
--------------------
Residue/Region: W162
  Function: A conserved tryptophan in the SH3 domain. Its role is structural,
              ensuring the SH3 domain is correctly folded, which is necessary for
              proper allosteric communication with the GK domain and alpha-1.
--------------------
Residue/Region: Hook/Linker region (residues ~200-210)
  Function: This flexible linker between the SH3 and GK domains is crucial for
              the correct relative positioning of the two domains, which is
              essential for transmitting the binding signal into a modulatory
              effect.
--------------------
Residue/Region: W236
  Function: A prime example of a dual-function residue. The strong binding energy
              from its interaction is directly coupled to the conformational
              changes that underlie gating modulation. Mutations here disrupt
              both binding and modulation.
--------------------
Residue/Region: GK domain surface loops
  Function: Residues on the loops surrounding the main binding pocket are
              involved in the allosteric signal propagation. The collective
              movement of these loops upon binding, rather than a single residue,
              alters alpha-1 subunit function.
