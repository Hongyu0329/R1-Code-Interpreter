    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have been recorded feeding on, I will use a Python script to represent the known dietary information for this insect order.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish the known food sources for adult Raphidiopterans based on entomological knowledge. They are known to be predators of small, soft-bodied arthropods, and they also supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\n2.  Evaluate each of the given answer choices against this established knowledge.\n3.  The script will check which of the individual food items listed (Nectar, Aphids, etc.) are part of the Raphidiopteran diet.\n4.  Based on this evaluation, the script will identify the most accurate and comprehensive answer choice from the list. Note that specific plant names from New Zealand (Māhoe, Karamū, Totara) may be distractors, as Raphidioptera are not native there; the key is the *type* of food.\n\n```python\ndef solve_diet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to find the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known dietary components for adult Raphidiopterans\n    # They are predators but also feed on nectar/pollen.\n    diet = {\n        \"nectar\",\n        \"pollen\",\n        \"aphids\",\n        \"mites\",\n        \"thrips\",\n        \"insect eggs\"\n    }\n\n    # The provided answer choices evaluated as food types\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"Nectar\",\n        \"B\": \"Māhoe pollen\", # Food type is 'pollen'\n        \"C\": \"Fungus\",\n        \"D\": \"Karamū leaf tissue\", # Food type is 'leaf tissue'\n        \"E\": \"Totara Aphids\" # Food type is 'aphids'\n    }\n\n    # Evaluate which options represent a known food type\n    is_a_correct = options[\"A\"].lower() in diet\n    # The key part of option E is 'Aphids'\n    is_e_correct = \"aphids\" in options[\"E\"].lower()\n\n    print(\"Analyzing Answer Choices:\")\n    print(f\"A.
