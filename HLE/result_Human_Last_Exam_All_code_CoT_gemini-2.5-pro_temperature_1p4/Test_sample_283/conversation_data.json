    "An HSS (Hierarchical Semi-separable) matrix structure is based on a hierarchical partitioning of the matrix. For a given depth `d`, this partitioning can be visualized as a binary tree. During a matrix operation like multiplication, we don't access the entire dense matrix but rather its compressed components. The number of submatrices accessed corresponds to the components stored in this hierarchical structure.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the number of submatrices:\n1.  **Diagonal Leaf Blocks**: The matrix is recursively partitioned until the leaf level of the hierarchy is reached. At this level, the diagonal blocks are stored as dense submatrices. For a tree of depth `d` (with levels 0 to d-1), there are `2^(d-1)` leaf nodes, and thus `2^(d-1)` diagonal leaf blocks that are accessed.\n2.  **Off-Diagonal Blocks**: At every partitioning step (i.e., for every non-leaf node in the tree), the off-diagonal blocks are represented in a compressed format (using so-called generator matrices). Each non-leaf node corresponds to a 2x2 block structure, which has 2 off-diagonal blocks. The number of non-leaf nodes in a complete binary tree of depth `d` is `2^(d-1) - 1`. Therefore, the number of off-diagonal blocks is `2 * (2^(d-1) - 1)`.\n3.  **Total Submatrices**: The total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the diagonal leaf blocks and the off-diagonal blocks.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this for a depth of 4.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication\n    for a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree.\n    depth = 4\n\n    # 1. Calculate the number of diagonal submatrices at the leaf level.\n    # For a binary tree of depth 'd' (levels 0 to d-1), there are 2^(d-1) leaves.\n    num_diagonal_blocks = 2**(depth - 1)\n\n    # 2. Calculate the number of off-diagonal submatrices.\n    # There are 2 off-diagonal blocks for each non-leaf node. The number of\n    # non-leaf nodes in a complete binary tree of depth 'd' is 2^(d-1) - 1.\n    num_non_leaf_nodes = 2**(depth - 1) - 1\n    num_off_diagonal_blocks = 2 * num_non_leaf_nodes\n\n    # 3. Calculate the total number of submatrices accessed.\n    total_submatrices = num_diagonal_blocks + num_off_diagonal_blocks\n\n    # 4.
