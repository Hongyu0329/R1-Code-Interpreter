    The question asks whether it is a theorem of ZFC (the standard axioms of set theory) that a certain structure must exist. This structure is a tree of height omega_1, where each level is a maximal antichain (a type of partition) in the Boolean algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1. Each level must refine the ones below it, have a size of at most omega_1, and crucially, the entire tree must not have a common refinement.

    The answer is "No", such a structure does not always exist. Its existence is independent of the ZFC axioms, meaning it cannot be proven or disproven from them.

    Here is the reasoning:

    1.  In some models of set theory, the answer is NO. The Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA) is a powerful axiom consistent with ZFC (assuming the consistency of large cardinals). A consequence of PFA is that any such tower of partitions, as described in the question, *must* have a common refinement. Therefore, in a mathematical universe where PFA holds, the tree you described cannot exist. Since this universe is a valid model of ZFC, it is impossible to prove in ZFC that the tree always exists.

    2.  In other models of set theory, the answer is YES. The Axiom of Constructibility (V=L) is another axiom consistent with ZFC. In a universe where V=L holds, one can explicitly construct such a tree. The construction typically uses a combinatorial principle called the Diamond Principle (denoted as diamond), which is a consequence of V=L. This principle allows for the construction to proceed stage-by-stage up to omega_1, systematically defeating every potential common refinement.

    Conclusion:
    Since the existence of this tree is provably false under one consistent extension of ZFC (PFA) and provably true under another (V=L), its existence is independent of ZFC. Therefore, one cannot say that such a tree *always* exists.
