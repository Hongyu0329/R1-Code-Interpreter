    print("\nStep 1: The Physical Origin of Tunneling in Ammonia (NH3)")
    print("Ammonia has a trigonal pyramid shape. The Nitrogen (N) atom can quantum-mechanically 'tunnel' through the plane of the Hydrogen (H) atoms, causing the pyramid to invert.")
    print("This physical process is possible because the potential energy surface has a double well. The existence of this potential depends on the masses and electric charges of the atoms, NOT on their nuclear spins.")
    print("Therefore, replacing normal hydrogens with exotic spin-0 hydrogens does not change the potential that allows for tunneling.")
    print("\nStep 2: The Pauli Exclusion Principle and Identical Particles")
    print("The Pauli principle governs the symmetry of the total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged.")
    print("  - Ordinary Hydrogen (protons, spin 1/2) are FERMIONS. The total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC upon their exchange.")
    print("  - Exotic Hydrogen (spin 0) are BOSONS. The total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC upon their exchange.")
    print("\nStep 3: Symmetry of Wavefunction Components for Exotic Ammonia")
    print("The total wavefunction can be seen as a product: Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial × Ψ_nuclear_spin.")
    print("(where Ψ_spatial includes vibrational, rotational, and electronic parts).")
    print("\nFor our exotic ammonia with spin-0 hydrogens (bosons):")
    print("  1. The nuclear spin state (Ψ_nuclear_spin) for spin-0 particles is always SYMMETRIC.")
    print("  2. For the total wavefunction (Ψ_total) to be symmetric, the spatial part (Ψ_spatial) must also be SYMMETRIC with respect to the exchange of hydrogen nuclei.")
    print("\nStep 4: The Effect on Tunneling States")
    print("The tunneling itself creates two distinct states from the ground vibrational state: a symmetric (+) state and an antisymmetric (-) state with respect to the inversion of the N atom.")
    print("The Pauli principle does not eliminate these states. Instead, it acts as a selection rule, forbidding certain rotational levels from being associated with these tunneling states.")
    print("However, there are still allowed rotational levels for BOTH the symmetric (+) and antisymmetric (-) tunneling states that satisfy the overall symmetry requirements.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Since both levels of the 'tunneling doublet' (the symmetric and antisymmetric states) can exist, the energy splitting due to tunneling is still present.")
    print("The exotic ammonia molecule would indeed exhibit tunneling, although the specific frequencies observed in its microwave spectrum would be different from normal ammonia due to the different set of allowed rotational transitions.")
