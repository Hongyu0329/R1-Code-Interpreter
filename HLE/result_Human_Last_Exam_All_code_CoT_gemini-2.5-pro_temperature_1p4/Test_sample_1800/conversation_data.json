    "Of course. Here is my analysis and the code to answer your question.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n1.  **Analyze the User's Question:** The user is asking for the \"ideal Ni/Ce ratio\" in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for two specific catalytic reactions: Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting (WS). This is a scientific question requiring knowledge from materials science and catalysis, not a direct computational problem.\n2.  **Consult Scientific Knowledge:** I need to recall information from my training data, which includes scientific literature on this topic.\n    *   The \"ideal\" ratio is not a single, universally fixed number. It can be influenced by factors like the synthesis method, reaction temperature, pressure, and the specific morphology of the nanoparticles.\n    *   However, a general consensus exists in the research community. For both WGS and WS, the catalytic performance is heavily dependent on the interaction between Ni and the Ceria (CeO₂) support. This interaction is maximized by having highly dispersed, small Ni nanoparticles and a high concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice.\n    *   Too little Ni leads to a low number of active sites. Too much Ni leads to the formation of larger Ni particles (sintering), which reduces the active surface area and can block the active sites on the ceria support. This leads to a loss of activity.\n    *   Multiple studies have shown that a relatively low Ni loading is optimal. An atomic ratio where Ce is significantly more abundant than Ni is preferred.\n3.  **Determine a Representative Ratio:** A widely reported and highly effective composition is around 10 mol% of Ni relative to the total metal content (Ni + Ce).\n    *   Let's calculate the corresponding Ni/Ce atomic ratio.\n    *   If mol% Ni = Ni / (Ni + Ce) = 0.10\n    *   This means Ni = 0.10 * (Ni + Ce) -> 0.90 * Ni = 0.10 * Ce -> Ni / Ce = 0.10 / 0.90 = 1/9.\n    *   So, an atomic ratio of **Ni:Ce ≈ 1:9** is a strong candidate for the \"ideal\" ratio. This ratio provides a good balance of active Ni sites and strong metal-support interaction with the Ceria.\n4.  **Plan the Code:** Since I cannot *calculate* this answer from scratch, I will use a Python script to present the findings clearly.\n    *   The script will state the context: that the ideal ratio depends on various factors.\n    *   It will then present the consensus ratio (1:9) found in scientific literature.\n    *   To fulfill the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement, I will print the ratio in the format \"Ni : Ce = 1 : 9\".\n    *   Finally, I'll calculate and print the decimal value of the Ni/Ce ratio.\n\nThis plan allows me to provide a scientifically accurate answer while adhering to all the formatting and coding constraints of the prompt.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio\n    for catalytic applications like WGS and water splitting based on\n    a review of scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Explanation based on scientific consensus\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single universal value,\")\n    print(\"as it depends on the synthesis method and specific reaction conditions.\")\n    print(\"However, extensive research has shown that a high catalytic performance is typically\")\n    print(\"achieved with a relatively low nickel loading. This ensures high dispersion of Ni\")\n    print(\"nanoparticles and maximizes the crucial interaction with the Ceria support,\")\n    print(\"which enhances the creation of oxygen vacancies vital for the reactions.\\n\")\n\n    # Define the parts of the commonly cited optimal atomic ratio\n    ni_part = 1\n    ce_part = 9\n\n    # The final \"equation\" as requested\n    print(\"Based on numerous studies, a highly effective atomic ratio of Ni to Ce is:\")\n    print(f\"    Ni : Ce = {ni_part} : {ce_part}\")\n\n    # Corresponding molar ratio value\n    ratio_value = ni_part / ce_part\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to a Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately {ratio_value:.2f}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_ideal_ratio()\n```\n<<<1:9>>>"
