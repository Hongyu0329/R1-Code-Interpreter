        'Analysis of Option D (Creep)': 'This is blade stretching (elongation), not material loss. The repair is often to cut the tip, a subtractive process.',

Restoring the tip length by welding on layers of filler material is a classic "build-up" repair procedure to maintain engine efficiency. This is the most direct and common application described.'
