# Step 1: Define the parameters a and lambda based on the analysis.
# Our analysis of the number of extrema for y2(x) showed that a=1 and lambda=1.
a = 1
_lambda = 1

# Step 2: Determine the value of y3(x0).
# Since a = lambda, the fractional differential equation for y3 simplifies to
# d^(1/2)y3/dx^(1/2) = 0.
# With the initial condition y3(0) = 0, the solution is y3(x) = 0 for all x.
# Therefore, y3 at any point x0 is 0.
y3_at_x0 = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the final expression.
# The expression is (N + lambda) * (y3(x0))^(lambda/a).
# The value of N is not needed because the y3 term evaluates to 0.

# The exponent term is lambda/a
exponent = _lambda / a

# The base is y3_at_x0
base = y3_at_x0

# The result of the exponentiation
power_result = 0
if base == 0 and exponent > 0:
    power_result = 0
elif base == 0 and exponent == 0:
    # This case is 0^0 which is indeterminate, but typically 1 in this context.
    # However, lambda/a = 1/1 = 1, so this case does not apply.
    power_result = 1 
else:
    power_result = base ** exponent

# Since N is an unknown integer, we represent it symbolically for the printout.
N_symbol = "N"

# The problem states "output each number in the final equation"
# We print the equation with the determined values.
