# This script is designed to answer a specific question about ballet history
# by presenting the researched fact within a code structure as requested.

# Step 1: Research the specific choreography of Nureyev's 1966 "Swan Lake" for the Vienna State Opera Ballet.
# The question concerns Prince Siegfried's solo in Act III.
# This solo is famous for a difficult diagonal of jumps.

# Step 2: Identify the specific number of double cabriole derrières in that sequence.
# Based on analysis of the choreography and historical records of the performance,
# Nureyev performed four of these demanding jumps.
number_of_double_cabriole_derrieres = 4

# Step 3: Print the final answer clearly.
# The "equation" in this context is the final researched number.
