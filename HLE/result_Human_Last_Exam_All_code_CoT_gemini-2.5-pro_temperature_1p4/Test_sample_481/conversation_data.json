    "My plan is to identify the numerical imprints for both the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules. I will then write a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and prints them out in a clear, comparative format, explicitly stating which number corresponds to which dosage, as requested. The script will not mention any restricted terms like color, size, or \"PLIVA\".\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the different numerical imprints\n    on Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerical imprint for the 10mg capsule\n    imprint_10mg = \"3108\"\n    \n    # Numerical imprint for the 20mg capsule\n    imprint_20mg = \"3109\"\n    \n    # Print the findings\n    print(\"The Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number:\")\n    print(imprint_10mg)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number:\")\n    print(imprint_20mg)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_imprint_numbers()\n```\n<<<The Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with the number 3108, while the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3109.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
