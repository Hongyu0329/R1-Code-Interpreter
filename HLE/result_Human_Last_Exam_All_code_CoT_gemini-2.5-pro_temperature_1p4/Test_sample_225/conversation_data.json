    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `x(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the parameters:** The frequencies are `a = 9` and `b = 5`. For the formula regarding self-intersections, we use `p = a = 9` and `q = b = 5`. We confirm that `p` and `q` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), which is true for 9 and 5.\n\n3.  **Apply the correct formula:** There is a standard formula for the number of self-intersection points `N` of a Lissajous curve. For the case where `x = cos(pt)` and `y = sin(qt)`, and `p` and `q` are both odd coprime integers greater than 1, the formula is:\n    `N = (p - 1) * (q - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:** We substitute `p = 9` and `q = 5` into the formula. This calculation will give us the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The parameters p and q are the frequencies from the parametric equations.\n    p = 9\n    q = 5\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections (N) for a Lissajous curve\n    # of the form x=cos(pt), y=sin(qt) where p and q are odd coprime integers is:\n    # N = (p - 1) * (q - 1) / 2\n    \n    # We will now calculate the result and print each step as requested.\n    \n    p_minus_1 = p - 1\n    q_minus_1 = q - 1\n    product = p_minus_1 * q_minus_1\n    num_intersections = product / 2\n\n    print(\"The number of self-intersection points is calculated using the formula N = (p - 1) * (q - 1) / 2.\")\n    print(\"For p = 9 and q = 5, the equation is:\")\n    # The request is to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"N = ({p} - 1) * ({q} - 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = {p_minus_1} * {q_minus_1} / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = {product} / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = {int(num_intersections)}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of self-intersection points is:\")\n    print(int(num_intersections))\n\nsolve_lissajous_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
