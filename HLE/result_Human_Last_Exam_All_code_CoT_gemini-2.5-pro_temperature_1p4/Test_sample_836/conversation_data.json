    "The quantity you are asking about, the space-time double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function of neutrons, is most commonly and accurately known as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of the neutron population fluctuations.\n\nIn the context of nuclear reactor noise analysis, specific models and measurements related to this quantity are also very common:\n*   **Rossi-alpha method:** A time-domain measurement of the temporal correlation function.\n*   **Feynman-alpha method:** A time-domain measurement relating the variance-to-mean of neutron counts.\n*   **Cohn-alpha formula:** The equation describing the Power Spectral Density (the frequency-domain representation) in a simple point-kinetics model. It shows a characteristic Lorentzian shape dependent on the prompt neutron decay constant, $\\alpha$.\n\nI will provide a Python script that illustrates the relationship for the temporal part of the transform, which is the most fundamental aspect in reactor noise analysis. The script demonstrates how the temporal correlation function (from Rossi-alpha) is Fourier transformed into the Power Spectral Density (described by the Cohn-alpha formula).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef illustrate_psd_concept():\n    \"\"\"\n    Illustrates the relationship between the neutron temporal correlation function\n    and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) in a simple point-kinetics model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In a simple reactor model (point kinetics), the temporal part of the\n    # pair correlation function, C(t), decays exponentially.
