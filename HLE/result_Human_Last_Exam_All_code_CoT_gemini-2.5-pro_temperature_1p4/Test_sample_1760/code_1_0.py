    Solves the edit distance metric properties question by evaluating each statement.

    Statement analysis:
    A) L(x,y) ≤ L(x,z) + L(z,y): True. Standard Levenshtein (L) is a metric and satisfies the triangle inequality.
    B) LT(x,y) = L(x,y) - 1 if...: False. Counterexample: x="abef", y="bafe". L=4, LT=2. Here LT != L, but y is not one transposition away from x. The statement's "otherwise" clause fails.
    C) All three distances satisfy symmetry: True. All defined operations (insert, delete, substitute, transpose, rotate) are reversible with the same unit cost, ensuring symmetry d(x,y) = d(y,x).
    D) LT can violate triangle inequality: True. Assuming LT is the common Optimal String Alignment (OSA) distance. For a="ca", b="ac", c="abc", LT(a,c) = 3, while LT(a,b) + LT(b,c) = 1 + 1 = 2. Thus 3 > 2.
    E) For any strings x,y: RL(x,y) ≤ L(x,y): True. RL's operation set is a superset of L's. The shortest path using more available operations can only be shorter or equal, never longer.
    F) There exist strings where LT differs from L by Θ(n): True. For x="a1b1a2b2...akbk" and y="b1a1b2a2...bkak" (n=2k), L(x,y)=2k=n while LT(x,y)=k=n/2. The difference is n/2, which is Θ(n).
    G) Triangle inequality for RL fails...: False. While RL's definition is not standard, distance metrics based on shortest paths of symmetric operations generally satisfy the triangle inequality. Without a definition that explicitly breaks it, we assume it holds.
    H) computing LT(x,y) requires Ω(n²) time...: True. This relates to the Edit Distance Conjecture. No strongly subquadratic time algorithm is known, and it's widely believed that O(n^2) is the optimal time complexity.
    I) LT forms a pseudometric but not a metric: False. If LT violates the triangle inequality (as per statement D), it is not a metric, nor is it a pseudometric (which also requires the triangle inequality).
    J) RL distance between "rat" and "tar" is 1...: True. This is a definitional statement about the non-standard RL for this problem. We accept it as a given property. L("rat", "tar") is indeed 2.
    K) All three distances are metrics...: False. Since D is true, LT is not a metric. Thus, not all three are metrics.
    L) at least two of the three distances must give identical values: True. By case analysis: if no ops are useful, L=LT=RL. If only transpositions are useful, LT < L=RL. If only rotations are useful, RL < L=LT. If both are useful and provide the same savings, L > LT=RL. It is difficult to construct a case where L, LT, RL are all different.
    M) if y from x using k transpositions, then LT(x,y) ≤ ⌈k/2⌉ + 1: False. Let LT be OSA. For x="abc", y="bca", it takes k=2 transpositions (abc->bac->bca). OSA("abc","bca")=3. The formula gives ceil(2/2)+1 = 2. The inequality 3 <= 2 is false.
    N) The ratio L(x,y)/LT(x,y) is unbounded: False. The ratio is bounded by 2, as each transposition saves at most one operation compared to Levenshtein (replaces 2 ops with 1).
    O) if x to y using only rotations and transpositions, RL(x,y) = LT(x,y): False. Counterexample: x="abc", y="bca". y is reachable by rotations (1 op) and transpositions (2 ops). RL("abc", "bca")=1 (one rotation), but LT("abc", "bca")=2.
