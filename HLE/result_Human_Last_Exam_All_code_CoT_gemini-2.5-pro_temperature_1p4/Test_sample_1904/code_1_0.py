    # The problem asks for the smallest possible number of connected components of CL(X).
    # Let N be this number.

    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound for N.
    # A key theorem in hyperspace topology states that for an ultrametric space X,
    # the hyperspace CL(X) with the Wijsman topology is connected if and only if X is connected.
    #
    # The problem specifies that X is a totally-disconnected space with infinitely many points.
    # A space with more than one point that is totally disconnected is, by definition, not connected.
    #
    # Since X is not connected, the theorem implies that CL(X) is also not connected.
    # This means the number of connected components, N, must be greater than 1.
    # The smallest integer greater than 1 is 2.
    # Therefore, we have the inequality: N >= 2.

    lower_bound = 2

    # Step 2: Establish an upper bound for N by finding an example.
    # We need to see if the minimum of 2 can actually be achieved.
    # Let's consider a specific example for X. The space of p-adic numbers, denoted Q_p,
    # is an infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space.
    #
    # For this space X = Q_p (and other similar spaces with 'admissible' metrics),
    # a known result states that CL(X) has exactly two connected components.
    # These two components are:
    # 1. The set of all non-empty bounded closed subsets.
    # 2. The set of all non-empty unbounded closed subsets.
    #
    # This example shows that it is possible for N to be 2.
    # Therefore, we have the inequality: N <= 2.

    achievable_value = 2

    # Step 3: Conclude the smallest possible number.
    # From Step 1, we know N must be at least 2.
    # From Step 2, we know N can be 2.
    # Combining these two facts, the smallest possible number of components is exactly 2.
    smallest_possible_number_of_components = 2

    # Step 4: Output the result as requested.
    # The final equation can be stated as: N = 2
    print("The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the smallest number of components, N, is 2.")
    print("The final equation is: N = 2")
    print("The number in the final equation is:")
