# Explanation of the chosen formula from option D
# In ontology alignment, theoretical completeness can be bounded by considering the
# information content of the ontology's structure. The conflict arises from mapping
# O1's 'mergeable siblings' to O2's 'strict categorical structure'.
# The term ln(b) represents the information entropy of the branching choices at each level.
# This information content is averaged or "amortized" over the depth 'd' of the ontology.
# Deeper hierarchies introduce more potential for inconsistencies, hence 'd' is in the denominator.
# This provides a theoretical upper bound on the completeness of the mapping.

# Calculate the theoretical completeness bound
completeness_bound = math.log(b) / d

# Print the final equation with the values and the result
print(f"The theoretical completeness of the mapping is bounded by the formula: ln(b) / d")
print(f"Given b = {b} and d = {d}, the calculation is:")
print(f"ln({b}) / {d} = {completeness_bound}")
