    "An analysis of the position is required to determine the best move.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position**: Identify the key strategic elements for both White and Black. White's main strength is the far-advanced passed pawn on d6. Black's strength is the active queen on c5, which attacks the d6-pawn and controls important squares.\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves**: Since the position is sharp, we must look for forcing moves like checks and captures.\n    *   **Candidate 1: `Qxc5+`**: A natural-looking move that trades queens. We need to analyze the resulting King and Pawn endgame to see if it's winning for White.\n    *   **Candidate 2: `Qf3`**: A move that attacks the Black queen, forcing a response. We need to analyze the consequences, primarily the resulting King and Pawn endgame after a queen trade.\n3.  **Compare the Outcomes**: Based on the analysis of the endgames resulting from the candidate moves, determine which move leads to a win.\n4.  **Formulate the Code**: Create a Python script that uses `print()` statements to explain this reasoning step-by-step, including the principal variation, and announces the final best move.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n*   **Analysis of `1. Qxc5+`**: After `1. Qxc5+ bxc5`, a King and Pawn endgame arises. The Black king on b6 is critically close to the action. White can try to race the pawn with `2. d7`, but Black's king simply walks over with `2... Kc7`, and after `3. d8=Q+ Kxd8`, Black's king and extra pawns will easily win. If White tries to bring their king over first with `2. Kf2`, Black will respond with `2... Kc6`, winning the race to the pawn. This line is losing for White.\n*   **Analysis of `1. Qf3`**: This is the correct move. It attacks the Black queen. Black's best response is to trade queens with `1... Qxf3+`. After `2. Kxf3`, a new King and Pawn endgame begins. Unlike the previous one, White's king is now activated at f3. The winning line is `2... Kc5 3. Ke4 Kb4 4. Kd4 Kxa4 5. Kc5!`. This last move is decisive. It puts Black's king in zugzwang (a situation where any move is disadvantageous). Black is forced to move the king away from the defense, allowing White's d-pawn to promote and win the game.\n\nBased on this analysis, `Qf3` is the winning move.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given chess position and prints the step-by-step reasoning for White's best move.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Chess Puzzle Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Position FEN: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Position\")\n    print(\"White has a major advantage with a passed pawn on d6, but it is attacked by Black's active queen on c5.\")\n    print(\"White must find a forcing move to convert this advantage into a win.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating a plausible but incorrect move\")\n    print(\"The move 1.
