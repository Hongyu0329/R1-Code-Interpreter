# Step 1: Determine the value of S from SNYWR
# We assign numerical values to letters based on their alphabetical position (A=1, B=2, ...)
snywr_map = {'S': 19, 'N': 14, 'Y': 25, 'W': 23, 'R': 18}

# Step 2: Define the geometric parameters
# In triangle ABC, BC = S and angle B = 30 degrees.
# Let a = BC = S, b = AC, and angle B = 30 degrees.
a = S
angle_B_deg = 30

# Step 3: Apply the condition for two possible triangles (ambiguous case SSA)
# For two triangles to exist, the length of side AC (b) must be
# greater than the altitude h from C, and less than the side BC (a).
# h = a * sin(B)
altitude_h = a * math.sin(math.radians(angle_B_deg))

# The condition is: h < b < a
# In our case: S/2 < AC < S

# Step 4: Find the number of integer values for AC that satisfy the condition.
lower_bound = altitude_h
upper_bound = a

# The integer values of AC must be in the range (lower_bound, upper_bound).
# The smallest integer is floor(lower_bound) + 1
# The largest integer is ceil(upper_bound) - 1, which is a - 1 since a is an integer.
min_integer_ac = int(lower_bound) + 1
max_integer_ac = int(upper_bound) - 1

# The number of integer values is max - min + 1
count = max_integer_ac - min_integer_ac + 1

# Print the explanation and the final equation for the count
