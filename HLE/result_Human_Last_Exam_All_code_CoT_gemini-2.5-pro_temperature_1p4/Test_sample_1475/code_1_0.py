    # The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably
    # many open dense subsets of a space P(X). This is a question related to the
    # Baire Category Theorem.

    # Let's break down the properties of the space P(X).
    # 1. X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point.
    #    This implies X is a perfect Polish space (complete, separable, no isolated points)
    #    and has the cardinality of the continuum, c.

    # 2. 2^X, the space of non-empty closed subsets of X with the Hausdorff metric,
    #    is a compact, and thus complete, metric space.

    # 3. P(X) is the subspace of 2^X consisting of sets that are closures of
    #    non-trivially convergent sequences. Such spaces are known to be G_delta
    #    subsets of 2^X. A G_delta subset of a complete metric space is
    #    topologically complete. P(X) is also separable and perfect.
    #    Therefore, P(X) is a perfect Polish space.

    # 4. Any perfect Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum, c = 2^{\aleph_0}.

    # 5. Let {G_n} be a countable collection of open dense subsets of P(X).
    #    By the Baire Category Theorem, their intersection G = cap(G_n) is dense in P(X).

    # 6. A stronger version of the theorem states that in a perfect Polish space,
    #    any such intersection (which is a dense G_delta set) must have the same
    #    cardinality as the space itself.

    # 7. Therefore, the cardinality of the intersection G is the cardinality of P(X),
    #    which is 2^{\aleph_0}.

    # Since this is the cardinality for any such intersection, it is also the
    # smallest possible cardinality.

    # The final equation for this cardinality is 2 to the power of aleph_0.
    base = 2
    number_in_aleph = 0
    aleph_symbol = "\u2135"  # Unicode for the Aleph symbol

    print(f"The smallest possible cardinality is that of the continuum.")
    print(f"The equation for this cardinality is: {base} ^ ({aleph_symbol}_{number_in_aleph})")
    print(f"This is the cardinality of the set of real numbers, often denoted 'c'.")
