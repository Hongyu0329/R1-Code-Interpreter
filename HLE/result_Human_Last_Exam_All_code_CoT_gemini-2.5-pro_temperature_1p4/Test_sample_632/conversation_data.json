    "My plan is to first determine the historical fact based on the user's question. The question is about a unique feature in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" that was removed around 1950. My historical knowledge indicates that this feature was the tram line, whose rails encircled the central fountain. This was removed as part of post-war city modernization.\n\nNext, I will create a Python script to present this answer. The script will store the information in a string variable and then use the `print()` function to output the answer clearly, as requested by the user.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the answer to the historical puzzle\n    about the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed around 1950.\n    removed_feature = \"The tram rails\"\n    \n    # A brief explanation.\n    explanation = \"The tram rails that circled the central fountain in the square were removed in the post-war period to modernize the city's infrastructure and traffic flow.\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a clear format.\n    print(\"The unique feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda around 1950 was:\")\n    print(removed_feature)\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_historical_puzzle()\n```\n<<<The tram rails>>>"
