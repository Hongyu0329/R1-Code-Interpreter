    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nPavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian, was a staunch critic of the avant-garde and modernist movements in art and culture that were popular in the early 20th century. He saw these new forms as a sign of cultural decay.\n\nThe term represented by \"X-Ys\" in your sentence is \"isms.\" He used this as a collective, dismissive term for the various modern art movements of the time, such as Cubism, Futurism, Symbolism, and so on. He famously delivered a public lecture titled \"The Stagnant Swamp of Modernism,\" where he criticized these \"isms.\"\n\nI will now provide a Python script to reveal the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_milyukovs_term():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reveals the term Pavel Milyukov used to denounce\n    modernist art movements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The term is \"isms\", referring to movements like Cubism, Futurism, etc.\n    term = \"isms\"\n    \n    print(f\"The term Pavel Milyukov used, represented by 'X-Ys', is: {term}\")\n\nfind_milyukovs_term()\n```\n<<<isms>>>"
