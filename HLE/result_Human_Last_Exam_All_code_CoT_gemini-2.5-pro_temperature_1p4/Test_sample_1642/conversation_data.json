    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The core of the task is to determine the maximum number `m` where `m` white queens and `m` black queens can be placed on a 16x16 board without any queen attacking another.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Rules:**\n    *   Total number of queens on the board is `m + m = 2m`.\n    *   The condition \"without attacking each other\" means that no two queens, regardless of their color, can share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n3.  **Reframe as a Classic Problem:** This problem is a direct application of the classic N-Queens problem. We are essentially asking for the maximum number of queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board in non-attacking positions. This total number of queens is `2m`.\n\n4.  **Apply the N-Queens Solution:** For any N x N chessboard where N is greater than 3, the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on it is exactly N. Since our board is 16x16, the maximum total number of queens is 16.\n\n5.  **Formulate and Solve the Equation:**\n    *   We know the total number of queens is `2m`.\n    *   We know the maximum possible number of queens is 16.\n    *   To find the maximum `m`, we set up the equation: `2 * m = 16`.\n    *   Solving for `m` gives `m = 16 / 2`, which is 8.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step and prints the final equation with the numbers involved, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\n    can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The size of the chessboard.\n    board_size = 16\n\n    print(f\"The problem is set on a {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard.\")\n    print(\"We need to place 'm' white queens and 'm' black queens.\")\n    print(\"This makes for a total of 2 * m queens on the board.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe condition 'without attacking each other' means no queen can attack any other queen, regardless of color.\")\n    print(\"This turns the problem into a standard N-Queens puzzle, where N is the board size.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFor a {board_size}x{board_size} board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens you can place is {board_size}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the total number of queens (2 * m) must be equal to the board size to be maximum.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nWe can set up the following equation:\")\n    # The variable names 'total_queens' and 'max_queens' are not used in the f-string\n    # to ensure the numbers are directly visible in the output per the instructions.\n    print(f\"2 * m = {board_size}\")\n\n    # Solve for m\n    m = board_size // 2\n\n    print(\"\\nSolving for m, we get:\")\n    print(f\"m = {board_size} / 2\")\n    print(f\"m = {m}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the maximum number m is {m}.\")\n\nsolve_queen_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
