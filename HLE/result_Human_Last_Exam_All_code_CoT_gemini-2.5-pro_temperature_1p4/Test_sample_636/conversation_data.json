    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the calculations and verify the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Objective**: Find a 2x2 feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n2.  **Desired Characteristic Equation**: The eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. For a desired pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`, the characteristic polynomial `p(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)` is:\n    `p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n    `p(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\n    `p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n    So the desired characteristic equation is `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n3.  **Relating to Matrix Properties**: For any 2x2 matrix `M`, its characteristic polynomial is also given by the formula `λ² - trace(M)λ + det(M) = 0`. By comparing this with our desired polynomial, we need to find an `F` such that the resulting `A + BF` has:\n    *   `trace(A + BF) = -2`\n    *   `det(A + BF) = 2`\n\n4.  **Solving for F**: Let's define the unknown gain matrix `F` as `F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]` and compute `A + BF`:\n    `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n    `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃ - 1, f₂ + 2f₄ + 1], [f₁ + 1, f₂]]`\n\n    Now we can set up a system of equations using the trace and determinant conditions:\n    a) `trace(A_cl) = (f₁ + 2f₃ - 1) + f₂ = -2  =>  f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1`\n    b) `det(A_cl) = (f₁ + 2f₃ - 1)f₂ - (f₂ + 2f₄ + 1)(f₁ + 1) = 2`\n\n5.  **Finding a Specific Solution**: This system has two equations and four unknowns, meaning there are infinitely many solutions. We can find one by making a simplifying assumption. Let's set `f₂ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\n    *   The equations become much simpler:\n        a) `f₁ + 0 + 2f₃ = -1  =>  f₁ + 2f₃ = -1`\n        b) `(f₁ + 2f₃ - 1)(0) - (0 + 0 + 1)(f₁ + 1) = 2  =>  -(f₁ + 1) = 2  => f₁ = -3`\n    *   Substituting `f₁ = -3` into the first simplified equation gives:\n        `-3 + 2f₃ = -1  =>  2f₃ = 2  =>  f₃ = 1`\n    *   Thus, one possible solution for the feedback gain is `F = [[-3, 0], [1, 0]]`.\n\n6.  **Verification Code**: The following Python code will define the matrices, use our calculated `F` to form the closed-loop system `A + BF`, and then verify that its properties (trace, determinant) and eigenvalues match our target.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set print options for better readability of matrices and complex numbers\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=3, suppress=True)\n\n# 1. Define the system matrices A and B\nA = np.array([\n    [-1, 1],\n    [1, 0]\n])\n\nB = np.array([\n    [1, 2],\n    [1, 0]\n])\n\n# 2. Define the calculated state feedback gain matrix F\n# This F was calculated by hand to place the eigenvalues at -1 +/- j\nF = np.array([\n    [-3., 0.],\n    [1., 0.]\n])\n\n# 3. Calculate the closed-loop system matrix A_cl = A + BF\nA_cl = A + B @ F\n\nprint(\"Calculated Feedback Gain Matrix F:\")\nprint(F)\nprint(\"\\nResulting Closed-Loop Matrix A + BF:\")\nprint(A_cl)\n\n# 4. Verify the properties of the closed-loop matrix A_cl\n# The characteristic equation is lambda^2 - trace(A_cl)*lambda + det(A_cl) = 0\n# For desired eigenvalues -1 +/- j, the equation is lambda^2 + 2*lambda + 2 = 0\n# This requires trace(A_cl) = -2 and det(A_cl) = 2.\n\n# Calculate the trace and determinant of our resulting matrix\ntrace_A_cl = np.trace(A_cl)\ndet_A_cl = np.linalg.det(A_cl)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Verification of Characteristic Equation ---\")\nprint(\"Desired characteristic equation: lambda^2 + 2*lambda + 2 = 0\")\nprint(f\"This requires trace = -2 and determinant = 2.\")\nprint(f\"Calculated trace(A+BF): {trace_A_cl:.1f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated det(A+BF):   {det_A_cl:.1f}\")\n\n# 5.
