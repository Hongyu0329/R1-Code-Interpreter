The two most likely reasons a functional MRI coil shows no resonance are **Active Detuning** and **Preamplifier Damping**. Active detuning circuits may be engaged by default when the coil is not connected to the scanner, shifting the resonance far from the operating frequency for safety. More commonly, the coil's dedicated low-noise preamplifier has a very low input impedance that heavily damps the coil's natural resonance (lowers its Q-factor). This is an intentional design feature to improve noise performance and decouple the coil from other RF sources, but it makes the resonance nearly invisible to an external probe like a VNA.
