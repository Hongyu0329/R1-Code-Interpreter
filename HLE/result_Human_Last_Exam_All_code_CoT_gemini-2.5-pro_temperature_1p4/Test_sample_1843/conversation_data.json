    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n2.  A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$, the prime power factors of $N$.\n3.  The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$.\n4.  For each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$, we will count the number of available primitive characters whose orders are divisors of $6$.\n5.  Finally, we will multiply the counts for each factor. We must also confirm that any combination of these chosen characters results in a character of order exactly $6$.\n\nThe script below will carry out these steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve_dirichlet_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for N=36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    REQUIRED_ORDER = 6\n\n    print(f\"This script calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {REQUIRED_ORDER}.\")\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize N.\n    # N = 36 * 1001 = (4 * 9) * (7 * 11 * 13)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Factor N = {N} into prime powers: 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^1 * 11^1 * 13^1.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: For each prime power conductor, count the number of primitive characters whose order divides {REQUIRED_ORDER}.\")\n\n    # For conductor 4 = 2^2\n    # The character group mod 4 is C_phi(4) = C_2.
