# The riddle describes a Chinese character by breaking it into its visual components.
# This script identifies the components and combines them to find the answer.

# 1. "A wooden stick" refers to the bottom part of the character.
# This is the radical for 'wood' or 'tree'.
component_wood = "木"

# 2. "a square box, a ladder placed in the center" refers to the top part.
# This is the radical for 'field', which is a box with a cross inside that looks like a ladder.
component_field = "田"

# 3. The final character is formed by placing the 'field' (田) on top of the 'wood' (木).
# This creates the character for "fruit".
final_character = "果"

print("The riddle describes the character formed by these parts:")
print(f"'{'A wooden stick'}': {component_wood}")
print(f"'{'A square box, a ladder placed in the center'}': {component_field}")
print("\nWhen combined (田 on top of 木), they form the character:")
