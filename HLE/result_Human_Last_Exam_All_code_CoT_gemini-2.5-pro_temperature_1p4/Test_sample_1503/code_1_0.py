    # --- Setup and Symbolic Definitions ---
    # We use symbolic variables to represent the components of the energy and Pohozaev functionals.
    # This allows us to reason about their general properties without needing specific functions u and v.

    # J(u,v) = K_J(u,v) - N_J(u,v)
    # K_J represents the kinetic energy term, which is quadratic.
    # N_J represents the nonlinear potential energy term, assumed to be homogeneous of degree p.
    K_J = sympy.Symbol('K_J', positive=True) # Kinetic part of J (e.g., 1/2 * ||grad u||^2)
    N_J = sympy.Symbol('N_J', positive=True) # Nonlinear part of J (e.g., integral of |u|^p)
    p = sympy.Symbol('p', real=True, positive=True) # Homogeneity of the nonlinear term

    # P(u,v) = K_P(u,v) - N_P(u,v)
    # The Pohozaev functional P. Its terms are related to the terms in J.
    # The kinetic part K_P is quadratic (homogeneity 2).
    # The nonlinear part N_P is homogeneous of degree p.
    K_P = sympy.Symbol('K_P', positive=True) # Kinetic part of P
    N_P = sympy.Symbol('N_P')               # Nonlinear part of P (can have any sign)
