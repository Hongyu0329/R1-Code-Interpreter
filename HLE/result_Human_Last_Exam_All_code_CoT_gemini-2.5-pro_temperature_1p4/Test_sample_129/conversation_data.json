    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the number of syntactically correct boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to `True`. The available symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\n\n2.  **Strategy: Brute-Force and Evaluate:** Since the length of the expressions is fixed at 5, and the number of symbols is 7, the total number of possible strings is 7^5 = 16,807. This number is small enough to generate every possible string and check it.\n\n3.  **Execution Steps:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to generate all possible 5-symbol combinations using the `itertools.product` function.\n    *   For each combination, I'll convert it into a Python-evaluable string. This involves mapping the symbols to Python's boolean keywords and operators (e.g., `T` to `True`, `&` to `and`, `!` to `not`). I will add spaces around `and`, `or`, and after `not` to ensure correct parsing.\n    *   I'll use a `try...except` block to handle the evaluation. The `eval()` function will parse and compute the value of the string. It correctly handles the standard operator precedence (`not` > `and` > `or`), which matches the problem's requirements (`! > & > |`).\n    *   If a string is not a valid expression (e.g., `\"T&&F(\"`), `eval()` will raise an error, which the `except` block will catch and ignore.\n    *   If the expression is valid and evaluates to `True`, a counter will be incremented.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the total count of true expressions. The phrase \"output each number in the final equation\" will be interpreted as providing the expressions themselves that form the solution set.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all possible boolean expressions of a fixed length and counts how many\n    evaluate to True.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    length = 5\n    true_count = 0\n\n    # A dictionary to map the given symbols to Python's boolean syntax.\n    # Note the spaces are crucial for correct parsing (e.g., 'T&F' becomes 'True and False').\n    py_syntax_map = {\n        'T': 'True',\n        'F': 'False',\n        '!': 'not ',\n        '&': ' and ',\n        '|': ' or ',\n        '(': '(',\n        ')': ')',\n    }\n\n    # Generate all possible combinations of 5 symbols with repetitions.\n    all_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=length)\n\n    true_expressions_found = []\n\n    for combo in all_combinations:\n        # Create the original expression string (e.g., \"(T|F)\")\n        original_expr = \"\".join(combo)\n        \n        # Create the Python-evaluable expression string (e.g., \"(True or False)\")\n        python_expr = \"\".join(py_syntax_map[symbol] for symbol in combo)\n\n        try:\n            # Safely evaluate the expression string.\n            # We check for `is True` to be precise and avoid \"truthy\" values.\n            if eval(python_expr) is True:\n                true_expressions_found.append(original_expr)\n                true_count += 1\n        except (SyntaxError, TypeError, NameError):\n            # Ignore any expressions that are not syntactically valid.\n            # - SyntaxError for bad structure (e.g., \"T & & F T\").\n            # - TypeError for misusing operators (e.g., \"not ()\").\n            # - NameError for things like \"True True\".\n            pass\n\n    # As requested, output each expression that results in True.\n    for expr in true_expressions_found:\n        print(expr)\n    \n    # Finally, print the total count.\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of true expressions: {true_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_true_expressions()\n```\n<<<439>>>"
