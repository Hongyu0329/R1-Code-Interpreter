    1.  In an aposyndetic continuum, every point is a non-block point.
        This means the set of non-block points is the entire space X.
    2.  The problem becomes finding the minimum cardinality of an aposyndetic continuum.
    3.  A singleton space X = {p} is a continuum (compact, connected, Hausdorff).
    4.  It is also aposyndetic because the condition "for any two distinct points"
        is vacuously true.
    5.  Therefore, the smallest aposyndetic continuum is a singleton space.
    6.  The cardinality of this space is 1.
