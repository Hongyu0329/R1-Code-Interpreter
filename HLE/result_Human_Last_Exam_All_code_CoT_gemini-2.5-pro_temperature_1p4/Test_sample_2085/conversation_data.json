    "This is a linguistic question rather than a coding problem. The name \"Odobeccus\" is not Gaulish but Frankish (a Germanic language), belonging to a 5th-century nobleman who lived in Gaul. To find the French equivalent, we can look at how French historical sources refer to this individual.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the historical figure \"Odobeccus\".\n2.  Find how this name is written in French historical texts and encyclopedias.\n3.  Write a simple Python script to print the original name and its French equivalent in a clear sentence, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the French equivalent for the Frankish name \"Odobeccus\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name is Frankish (Germanic), not Gaulish, though the person lived in Gaul.\n    # In French historical sources, the name is typically rendered as \"Odobech\".\n    original_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n    french_equivalent = \"Odobech\"\n\n    print(f\"The French equivalent of the name '{original_name}' is '{french_equivalent}'.\")\n\nfind_french_equivalent()\n```\n<<<Odobech>>>"
