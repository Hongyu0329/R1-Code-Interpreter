    "I will solve this by programmatically analyzing the text of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\".\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Retrieve the Text**: I will fetch the full text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" from the Project Gutenberg online library.\n2.  **Process the Text**: I will clean the text by removing punctuation and converting all words to lowercase. This ensures that my search for the words is not affected by capitalization or punctuation.\n3.  **Analyze Each Word**: For each word in the provided answer choices (Wente, Here, Fool, Hool, Countour), I will perform two checks:\n    a.  **Presence Check**: First, I will determine if the word even exists in the poem. A word cannot be part of a rhyme if it's not in the text.\n    b.  **Rhyme Check**: If the word is present, I will find all instances where it appears at the end of a line, as this is where rhymes occur in Chaucer's couplets. I will then examine the word at the end of the adjacent line (either before or after) to see if it forms a plausible rhyme.\n4.  **Identify the Unrhymed Word**: Based on the analysis, the word that is either not present in the text or is present but never used in a rhyming pair will be the answer.\n\nI will now execute this plan using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport requests\n\ndef solve_chaucer_rhyme_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes \"Book of the Duchess\" to find which word from a list is not used in a rhyme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Retrieve the text from Project Gutenberg\n    try:\n        url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2242/pg2242.txt\"\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        full_text = response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error retrieving text: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Extract the poem itself, removing Gutenberg's header/footer\n    # This is a best-effort extraction based on known start/end phrases.\n    try:\n        start_marker = \"THE BOOK OF THE DUCHESS\"\n        end_marker = \"*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BOOK OF THE DUCHESS ***\"\n        start_index = full_text.find(start_marker)\n        end_index = full_text.find(end_marker)\n        if start_index == -1 or end_index == -1:\n            print(\"Could not find start/end markers for the poem in the downloaded text.\")\n            return\n        poem_text = full_text[start_index:end_index]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error processing text: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Process the text\n    lines = poem_text.strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    # Create a list of all words for the presence check\n    all_words = set(re.findall(r'\\b[a-z]+\\b', poem_text.lower()))\n\n    # Create a list of end-of-line words for rhyme analysis\n    end_words = []\n    line_map = {}\n    for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n        # Find all words in the line, take the last one if it exists\n        words_in_line = re.findall(r'\\b[a-zA-Z]+\\b', line)\n        if words_in_line:\n            last_word = words_in_line[-1].lower()\n            end_words.append(last_word)\n            line_map[i] = line.strip()\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze each candidate word\n    candidates = {\n        'A': 'wente',\n        'B': 'here',\n        'C': 'fool',\n        'D': 'hool',\n        'E': 'countour'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing Chaucer's 'Book of the Duchess' for unrhymed words...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    unrhymed_candidate = None\n\n    for option, word in candidates.items():\n        print(f\"Checking Candidate {option}: '{word}'\")\n\n        # 3a.
