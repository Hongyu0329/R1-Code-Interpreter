    print("This means the gate's operation can be separated into two parts:")

    print("A gate is correctable to SWAP by local operations only if it has the same entangling power as SWAP.")
    print("The SWAP gate is non-entangling (it doesn't create entanglement from product states). Therefore, a correctable SWAP variant must also be non-entangling.")

    print("  - For this state to be non-entangled (separable), either F or G must be zero.")
    print("  - Since it's a SWAP variant, we need G to be non-zero. Thus, F must be 0.")
    print("  - Similarly, applying the gate to |10> gives J|01> + K|10>. Since J must be non-zero for a swap, K must be 0.")
    print("For the 'non-swap' subspace, a simple variant shouldn't swap |00> with |11>, so D and M should be 0.")

    print("Option D is: [[A, 0, 0, 0], [0, F, G, 0], [0, J, K, 0], [0, 0, 0, P]].")
    print("This structure correctly isolates the non-swap states |00> and |11> (D=M=0).")
    print("It correctly confines the main operation to the swap subspace.")
