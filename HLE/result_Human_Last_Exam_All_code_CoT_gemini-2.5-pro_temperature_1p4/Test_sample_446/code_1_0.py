    The RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence is the primary recognition
    motif for many integrin receptors. All provided options contain this motif.
    
    The key to answering this question lies in the flanking amino acids, which
    provide specificity and enhance binding affinity. We need to identify the
