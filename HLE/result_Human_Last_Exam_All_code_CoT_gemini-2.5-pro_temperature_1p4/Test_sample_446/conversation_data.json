    "The task is to identify which of the provided peptide sequences is known or highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  All the provided peptides start with the sequence RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). This is the canonical minimal recognition motif for many integrin receptors.\n2.  The binding affinity and specificity of the RGD motif are heavily influenced by the amino acids flanking it and the peptide's overall conformation.\n3.  I will evaluate each option based on established knowledge of well-characterized integrin-binding peptides.\n4.  The sequence `RGDSP` (a subsequence of `RGDSPSS`) is a very famous and widely studied peptide derived from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein and a natural ligand for several integrins (e.g., α5β1, αvβ3).\n5.  The other sequences (RGDMAA, RGDLTTP, RGDQVSK, RGDARGG) are not as well-known or established in literature as specific, high-affinity integrin binders compared to the fibronectin-derived sequence.\n6.  Therefore, `RGDSPSS` is the most likely candidate to have been found to bind integrin receptors in an in vitro assay.\n7.  I will write a Python script to present this reasoning and output the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_integrin_binding():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes peptide sequences to determine the most likely integrin binder.\n    \n    The RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence is the primary recognition\n    motif for many integrin receptors. All provided options contain this motif.\n    \n    The key to answering this question lies in the flanking amino acids, which\n    provide specificity and enhance binding affinity.
