    # Can a polynomial of bi-degree (5, 2) be constructed using operators E_{r,0} for r=1,2?

    # Operator E_{2,0} changes bi-degree by (+1, -2).

    # Let's say we start with a polynomial of bi-degree (0, k) and apply E_{1,0} N1 times
    # and E_{2,0} N2 times.
    # a_final = 0 + N1*0 + N2*1 = N2
    # b_final = k - N1*1 - N2*2
    # We need a_final = 5, so N2 = 5.
    # We need b_final = 2, so 2 = k - N1 - 5*2 => k = 12 + N1.
    # We can choose N1=0, which gives k=12.
    # So, starting with a polynomial of bi-degree (0, 12) and applying E_{2,0} five times
    # yields a polynomial of bi-degree (5, 2).
