    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** I will first find all the prime numbers that multiply together to make 8139881. The best way to do this for a number of this size is a method called \"trial division\".\n2.  **Trial Division Algorithm:**\n    *   I'll start by checking if the number is divisible by 2.\n    *   Then, I'll check for divisibility by odd numbers (3, 5, 7, and so on) up to the square root of the number.\n    *   Whenever a factor is found, I'll divide the original number by that factor and continue the process with the new, smaller number.\n    *   If, after checking all possibilities, there's a number left over, that remaining number is also a prime factor.\n3.  **Identify the Largest Factor:** Once I have the complete list of prime factors, I will simply find the largest one in the list.\n4.  **Final Output:** The code will print the full prime factorization equation and then state the largest prime divisor.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the prime factors of a number n and returns the largest one.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_number = n\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Handle factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n        \n    # Handle odd factors\n    # We check from 3 up to the square root of the remaining n\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n            \n    # This condition is to handle the case when n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n        \n    # If the number was prime initially, the list will just contain the number itself\n    if not factors:\n        factors.append(original_number)\n\n    # Print the prime factorization equation\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, sorted(factors)))\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_number} is: {equation_str}\")\n\n    # Find and print the largest prime divisor\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_number} is: {largest_prime}\")\n        return largest_prime\n    else:\n        # This case is for n=1, but the input is 8139881\n        print(f\"{original_number} has no prime divisors.\")\n        return None\n\n# The number provided by the user\nnumber_to_factorize = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factorize)\n```\n<<<2873>>>"
