    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Request:** The problem asks for the \"Crawley-Nordström invariant\" for a given Calabi-Yau link. The provided polynomial has a term that doesn't match the required degree, indicating a likely typo. In such contexts, especially for isolated singularities defined by quasi-homogeneous polynomials, a key invariant is the **Milnor number (μ)**. I will proceed assuming this is the intended invariant.\n2.  **Identify Parameters:** I will extract the five weights `w_i` from the problem statement and calculate the degree `d` by summing them, as required by the Calabi-Yau condition.\n3.  **State the Formula:** I will use the standard formula for the Milnor number of a quasi-homogeneous singularity:\n    μ = (d/w₁ - 1) * (d/w₂ - 1) * ... * (d/w₅ - 1)\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script to substitute the values of `d` and `w_i` into the formula. The script will first represent the calculation as a product of fractions, then compute the final integer result.\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final output will clearly show each step of the calculation as a mathematical equation, including the initial formula, the substitution of values, and the final result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant, interpreted as the Milnor number,\n    for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights and polynomial are given in the problem description.\n    # We will use the weights to determine the degree 'd' based on the Calabi-Yau condition.\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    d = sum(weights)\n\n    # The Milnor number formula for a quasi-homogeneous polynomial singularity is:\n    # μ = product over i of (d/w_i - 1)\n    \n    numerators = [d - w for w in weights]\n    denominators = weights\n\n    # We calculate the final result by multiplying the fractions.\n    # Using integer arithmetic throughout avoids floating point errors.\n    numerator_product = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, numerators)\n    denominator_product = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, denominators)\n    result = numerator_product // denominator_product\n\n    # The final output will be formatted to show the calculation steps.\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link is interpreted as the Milnor number (μ).\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the weights and the quasi-homogeneous degree of the polynomial.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Weights: w = {tuple(weights)}\")\n    print(f\"Degree: d = {' + '.join(map(str, weights))} = {d}\\n\")\n    print(\"The Milnor number is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"μ = (d/w₁ - 1) * (d/w₂ - 1) * (d/w₃ - 1) * (d/w₄ - 1) * (d/w₅ - 1)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Substituting the values into the formula:\")\n    \n    # Building the string for the equation with fractions\n    frac_terms = [f\"(({d} - {w})/{w})\" for w in weights]\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(frac_terms)\n    print(f\"μ = {equation_str}\")\n    \n    final_equation_terms = [f\"({num}/{den})\" for num, den in zip(numerators, denominators)]\n    final_equation_str = \" * \".join(final_equation_terms)\n    \n    print(f\"μ = {final_equation_str}\")\n    \n    # The final equation as requested, showing each number.\n    print(f\"μ = {numerators[0]}/{denominators[0]} * {numerators[1]}/{denominators[1]} * {numerators[2]}/{denominators[2]} * {numerators[3]}/{denominators[3]} * {numerators[4]}/{denominators[4]} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n<<<1568>>>\n```"
