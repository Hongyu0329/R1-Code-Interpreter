    explanation = """
    A valid Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) requires that several assumptions are met. No single assumption is sufficient on its own.

    1.  Transitivity (A) and Similarity of Effect Modifiers (D) are fundamental prerequisites. They establish the conceptual basis for comparing treatments indirectly. If a network is not transitive, the NMA is invalid. However, satisfying transitivity alone does not guarantee that the statistical results from direct and indirect comparisons will align. Thus, it is necessary but not sufficient.

    2.  Consistency (B) is the statistical check that direct and indirect evidence agree. A lack of consistency (incoherence) invalidates the NMA results. However, having consistency does not fix other potential problems, such as high heterogeneity within the direct comparisons. Thus, it is necessary but not sufficient.

    3.  Homogeneity (C) is the assumption of a common effect size across studies for a given comparison. This is a very strong assumption that is often relaxed by using random-effects models to account for statistical heterogeneity. An NMA can be valid without strict homogeneity if heterogeneity is modeled correctly. Therefore, it is neither necessary nor sufficient.

    Conclusion: The overall validity of an NMA depends on the interplay of these concepts. You need a transitive network, you need to check for and confirm consistency, and you need to appropriately model the heterogeneity. Because multiple conditions must be satisfied, no single option is sufficient.
