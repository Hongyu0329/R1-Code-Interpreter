    # The problem asks for the minimum number of queries for an SQ algorithm to learn
    # poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU networks.

    # 1. This problem is known to be SQ-hard. The hardness is shown by relating it to
    #    learning intersections of k halfspaces, a known hard problem.
    # 2. A two-layer ReLU network of size poly(d) can represent intersections of k=poly(d) halfspaces.
    # 3. The SQ query complexity lower bound for learning intersections of k halfspaces
    #    is known to be d^Omega(log k).

    # 4. We substitute k = poly(d) into the formula.
    #    d^Omega(log(poly(d))) simplifies to d^Omega(log d).

    # The components of the final expression are:
    base = "d"
    outer_function = "Omega"
    inner_function = "log"
    inner_variable = "d"

    # We print the final result, which represents a super-polynomial lower bound.
    print("The minimum number of queries needed is a super-polynomial function of the dimension d.")
    print("The precise lower bound is expressed as:")

    # Printing the components of the final equation as requested.
    # The equation is: d ^ (Omega(log(d)))
