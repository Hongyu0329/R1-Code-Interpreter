    "To find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system, we will use the principle of duality. The observability of a system (A, C) is dual to the controllability of the system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). The transformation to observer canonical form for (A, C) can be found by first finding the transformation that converts the dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) to controller canonical form.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the dual system**: Given the original system matrices A and C, we define the dual system matrices as `A_d = Aᵀ` and `B_d = Cᵀ`.\n2.  **Check Controllability and Find Indices**: We will construct the controllability matrix for the dual system, `Wc = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d²*B_d, ...]`. From `Wc`, we will select the first `n` linearly independent columns (where `n` is the state dimension) to form an invertible matrix `Wc_bar`. The selection process also determines the controllability indices `v_i` for the dual system.\n3.  **Find the Transformation Matrix for the Dual System**: We compute the inverse of `Wc_bar`. Following the standard procedure for multi-input systems, we will extract specific rows from `Wc_bar⁻¹` to form a set of vectors `p_i`. These vectors are then used to construct the transformation matrix `T_inv` that transforms the dual system into controller canonical form.\n4.  **Transform the Original System**: The transformation matrix for the original system to go into observer canonical form is `P = (T_inv)⁻ᵀ`. The new state is `x_o = Px`, which means the new system matrices are `A_o = P*A*P⁻¹` and `C_o = C*P⁻¹`. Using the relationship `P⁻¹ = Tᵀ`, we can directly compute the new output matrix `C_o = C * Tᵀ`.\n5.  **Calculate and Print the Result**: We will implement these steps in Python using the NumPy library for matrix operations and print the final value of the new matrix `C_o`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the original and dual system matrices\n    A = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n                  [2, 1, 1],\n                  [0, 2, 0]])\n    C = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                  [1, 1, 0]])\n\n    Ad = A.T\n    Bd = C.T\n\n    n = A.shape[0]  # State dimension\n    p = C.shape[0]  # Number of outputs (inputs for dual system)\n\n    # Step 2: Build controllability matrix for the dual system and find indices\n    \n    # Construct the full controllability matrix up to n-1 power\n    Wc_full = Bd\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        Wc_full = np.hstack((Wc_full, Ad @ np.linalg.matrix_power(Ad, i-1) @ Bd))\n\n    # Select first n linearly independent columns and find controllability indices\n    Wc_bar_cols = []\n    selected_indices = []\n    rank = 0\n    v_counts = [0] * p\n    \n    for i in range(Wc_full.shape[1]):\n        col = Wc_full[:, i:i+1]\n        temp_matrix = np.hstack(Wc_bar_cols + [col]) if Wc_bar_cols else col\n        \n        if np.linalg.matrix_rank(temp_matrix) > rank:\n            Wc_bar_cols.append(col)\n            selected_indices.append(i)\n            rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(temp_matrix)\n            v_counts[i % p] += 1\n        \n        if rank == n:\n            break\n            \n    Wc_bar = np.hstack(Wc_bar_cols)\n    controllability_indices = v_counts\n\n    # Step 3: Find the transformation matrix T_inv for the dual system\n    Wc_bar_inv = np.linalg.inv(Wc_bar)\n\n    # Determine the rows from Wc_bar_inv to construct T_inv\n    row_indices_for_p = np.cumsum(controllability_indices)\n    \n    p_vectors = []\n    for index in row_indices_for_p:\n        # 0-indexed, so subtract 1\n        p_vectors.append(Wc_bar_inv[index - 1, :])\n\n    # Construct T_inv from the p_vectors\n    T_inv_rows = []\n    for i in range(p):\n        p_current = p_vectors[i]\n        for j in range(controllability_indices[i]):\n            row = p_current @ np.linalg.matrix_power(Ad, j)\n            T_inv_rows.append(row)\n            \n    T_inv = np.vstack(T_inv_rows)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the new C matrix for the observer canonical form\n    # We need T_transpose for the formula Co = C * T_transpose\n    # T = inv(T_inv) => T_transpose = inv(T_inv).T\n    T = np.linalg.inv(T_inv)\n    T_transpose = T.T\n\n    Co = C @ T_transpose\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final result\n    print(\"The original system matrices are:\")\n    print(\"A =\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nC =\")\n    print(C)\n    \n    print(\"\\nUsing the duality principle, we transform the dual system (A.T, C.T) to\")\n    print(\"controller canonical form to find the transformation for the original system.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe new output matrix C in observer canonical form is C_o = C * T.T\")\n    print(\"The calculated value for the new matrix C is:\")\n    print(Co)\n\n\nsolve()\n<<<\n[[ 0.   0.5  1. ]\n [ 1.   0.  -1. ]]\n>>>"
