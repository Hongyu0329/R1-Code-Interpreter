# The problem asks for the limit L = lim_{k->inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)].
# f(k) is the integer-valued state complexity.
# The analysis shows that for the limit L to exist as a single value,
# f(k) must behave as an arithmetic progression for large k.
# This means f(k) is asymptotically linear, i.e., f(k) â‰ˆ L*k + C.

# From the construction of a DFA, we have an upper bound f(k) <= k.
# This implies L <= 1.
# A sub-linear complexity (e.g., logarithmic) would lead to a non-convergent
# sequence of differences due to the integer nature of f(k), so L cannot be 0.
# Since L must be an integer, the only possibility is L = 1.

# We model the asymptotic behavior of f(k) as k.
k = sympy.Symbol('k', integer=True)

# The expression inside the limit is f(k+1) - f(k).
expression = f.subs(k, k + 1) - f

# Compute the limit of the expression as k approaches infinity.
limit_value = sympy.limit(expression, k, sympy.oo)

# In the final equation, we have the difference of f(k+1) and f(k) resulting in the limit.
# f(k+1) is asymptotically 1*(k+1)
# f(k) is asymptotically 1*k
# lim [1*(k+1) - 1*k] = 1
