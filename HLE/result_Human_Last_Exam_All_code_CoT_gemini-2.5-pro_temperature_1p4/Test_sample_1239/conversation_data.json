    "The problem is to find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions. This requires identifying all the continuous transformations of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leave the form of the equations unchanged. These transformations form a Lie group, and its dimension is the number of independent parameters needed to specify a transformation in the group.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List the fundamental symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. These are well-established in the field of fluid dynamics and mathematical physics.\n2.  For each type of symmetry, determine the number of parameters it depends on. This number is the dimension contributed by that symmetry.\n3.  The symmetries include time translation, spatial translations, spatial rotations, Galilean boosts, and a scaling transformation.\n4.  The total dimension of the *finite-dimensional* Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetries.\n5.  I will write a Python script to list these symmetries, their individual dimensions, and compute the sum, printing the final equation and result.\n\nNote: The equations also possess an infinite-dimensional symmetry related to pressure shifts ($p \\to p + c(t)$), which is typically treated separately. The standard question refers to the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry group.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The symmetry group is known as the Galilean-similitude group.\n    # We define a dictionary mapping each symmetry type to its dimension.\n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translation\": 1,\n        \"Spatial translations\": 3,\n        \"Spatial rotations\": 3,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": 3,\n        \"Scaling (Dilation)\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 is composed of the following transformations:\")\n    \n    dimensions = []\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: Contributes {dim} dimension(s).\")\n        dimensions.append(dim)\n        \n    total_dimension = sum(dimensions)\n    \n    # Constructing the equation string as requested.\n    # The map(str, dimensions) converts each number in the list to a string.\n    # \" + \".join(...) joins these strings with \" + \" in between.\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, dimensions))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetries.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_dimension}\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: This is the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional part of the symmetry group.
