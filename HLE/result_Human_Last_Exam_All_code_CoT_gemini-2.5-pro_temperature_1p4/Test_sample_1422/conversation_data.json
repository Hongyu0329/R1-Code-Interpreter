    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use a systematic approach based on the topological properties of these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** We'll assume the simplest and most common interacting scalar field theory, which is the $\\phi^4$ (\"phi-four\") theory. In this theory, every interaction vertex connects four lines.\n2.  **Use Topological Formulas:** There are two fundamental formulas that relate the key properties of a Feynman diagram:\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   `4V = 2I + E`, where `E` is the number of external lines. This formula comes from the fact that each of the `V` vertices has 4 line \"stubs\", and these stubs are connected by either internal lines (which connect two stubs) or external lines (which connect one stub).\n3.  **Solve for Vertices (V):** We are given `L = 2`. We will use the two formulas to derive an equation for `V` in terms of the number of external lines `E`.\n4.  **Minimize Vertices:** To find the minimum number of vertices, we will find the minimum possible number of external lines `E` for a valid diagram.\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** We will plug the minimum value of `E` into our equation to find the minimum number of vertices `V`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop\n    Feynman diagram for a phi-4 interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of loops\n    L = 2\n\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram,\")\n    print(\"we use the general relations for a scalar phi-4 theory.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"First, we have the topological formula relating loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V):\")\n    print(f\"L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(f\"For L = {L} loops, this becomes: {L} = I - V + 1, which rearranges to I = V + 1.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Second, for a phi-4 theory, each vertex connects 4 lines.
