    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define a Coordinate System:** We'll place the first cube (Cube 1) at the origin of a 3D coordinate system. Its edges will be aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Since the side length is 1, Cube 1 occupies the space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Shift:** The \"main diagonal\" of this cube connects the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite corner (1,1,1). A shift \"along the main diagonal\" means the displacement has equal components in the x, y, and z directions. A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal corresponds to a translation vector of `<0.5, 0.5, 0.5>`.\n\n3.  **Define the Second Cube:** The second cube (Cube 2) is the first cube shifted by this vector. Therefore, its coordinates will range from `0+0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1+0.5`, `0+0.5 ≤ y ≤ 1+0.5`, and `0+0.5 ≤ z ≤ 1+0.5`. This simplifies to `0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1.5`, `0.5 ≤ y ≤ 1.5`, and `0.5 ≤ z ≤ 1.5`.\n\n4.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the region where a point belongs to *both* cubes. We find the overlapping range for each axis:\n    *   **x-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`.\n    *   **y-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`.\n    *   **z-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[0.5, 1.5]` is `[0.5, 1]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a smaller cube with a side length equal to the length of the overlapping range, which is `1 - 0.5 = 0.5`. The volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the final volume.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the properties of the cubes\nside_length = 1.0\nshift_along_diagonal = 0.5\n\n# Define the boundaries of the first cube (C1)\nc1_min = 0.0\nc1_max = c1_min + side_length\n\n# The shift vector is applied to each coordinate\nshift_vector_component = shift_along_diagonal\n\n# Define the boundaries of the second, shifted cube (C2)\nc2_min = c1_min + shift_vector_component\nc2_max = c1_max + shift_vector_component\n\nprint(\"--- Step 1: Define the Cubes ---\")\nprint(f\"Cube 1 (C1) occupies the region where 0 <= x, y, z <= {c1_max:.1f}.\")\nprint(f\"Cube 2 (C2) is shifted by {shift_along_diagonal} along the main diagonal.\")\nprint(f\"C2 occupies the region where {c2_min:.1f} <= x, y, z <= {c2_max:.1f}.\")\n\n# Calculate the boundaries of the intersection\nintersect_min = max(c1_min, c2_min)\nintersect_max = min(c1_max, c2_max)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 2: Determine the Intersection ---\")\nprint(f\"The intersection is a smaller cube where the regions overlap.\")\nprint(f\"Its boundaries are from {intersect_min:.1f} to {intersect_max:.1f} on each axis.\")\n\n# Calculate the side length of the intersection cube\nintersect_side_length = intersect_max - intersect_min\nprint(f\"The side length of this intersection cube is {intersect_max:.1f} - {intersect_min:.1f} = {intersect_side_length:.1f}.\")\n\n# Calculate the volume of the intersection\nvolume = math.pow(intersect_side_length, 3)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Step 3: Calculate the Volume ---\")\nprint(\"The volume of the intersection cube is its side length cubed.\")\nprint(f\"Volume = {intersect_side_length:.1f} * {intersect_side_length:.1f} * {intersect_side_length:.1f} = {volume}\")\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
