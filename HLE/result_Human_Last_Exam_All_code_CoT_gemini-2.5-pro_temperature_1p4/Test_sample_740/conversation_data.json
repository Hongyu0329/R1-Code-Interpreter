    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind: `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x,y) u(y) dy`, where the forcing function is `f(x) = 1` and the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n2.  The kernel can be expanded as a finite sum: `K(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`. This is a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n3.  Because the kernel is a polynomial in `x`, the solution `u(x)` must also be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. We can write `u(x) = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^j`.\n4.  Substituting this polynomial form into the integral equation transforms the problem into a system of linear equations for the coefficients `c_j`. This system can be written as `(I - λA)c = g`, where `c` is the vector of coefficients `[c_0, ..., c_{n-1}]`, `g` is the vector for the constant function `f(x)=1` (which is `[1, 0, ..., 0]`), and `A` is the `n x n` matrix representing the integral operator in the polynomial basis `{1, x, ..., xⁿ⁻¹}`.\n5.  The matrix `A` has elements `A_{ij} = 1/(n+j-i)` for `i,j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n6.  According to the Fredholm alternative, the equation has no solution if `λ` is a characteristic value (i.e., `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the operator/matrix `A`) AND the forcing term `g` is not in the range of the operator `(I - λA)`.\n7.  The characteristic values of `λ` are the roots of the equation `det(I - λA) = 0`.\n8.  It can be shown that for these `λ`, the condition on `g` is met, meaning no solution exists.\n9.  The equation `det(I - λA) = 0` can be rewritten as a polynomial equation in `λ`. The eigenvalues of `A`, let's call them `μ`, are the roots of the characteristic polynomial `det(A - μI) = 0`. The values of `λ` are simply the reciprocals `1/μ`.\n10. Since `n` is not specified, I will provide a Python script that takes `n` as a parameter and calculates the polynomial equation for `λ`. I will use `n=2` as a concrete example. The script will compute the coefficients of the polynomial for `λ` and print the equation as well as the numerical solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solutions\n    for a specified integer n >= 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    # For n=1, the equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫u(y)dy leads to λ=1 having no solution.\n    if n == 1:\n        print(\"For n = 1, the equation is λ^1 - 1 = 0\")\n        print(\"The value of λ for which there is no solution is:\")\n        print(\"λ = 1.0\")\n        return\n\n    # The problem can be converted to a matrix equation (I - λA)c = g.\n    # No solution exists for λ = 1/μ where μ is an eigenvalue of A,\n    # provided a condition on the forcing term g holds (which it does).\n    # The matrix A has elements A_ij = 1/(n+j-i) for i, j from 0 to n-1.\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            A[i, j] = 1.0 / (n + j - i)\n\n    # The values of λ are the roots of det(I - λA) = 0.\n    # Let p(μ) = det(μI - A) be the characteristic polynomial of A.
