    Solves the theoretical problem about the density of points on an algebraic curve.

    The problem asks for the asymptotic ratio of two sets of points on a curve C as their height H grows.
    - Numerator N: The count of irreducible degree d points belonging to a linear system g^r_d.
    - Denominator D: The count of all degree d points.

    A simple geometric analysis would suggest the ratio approaches 0, as the g^r_d is a subvariety of
    lower dimension (r) inside the space of all degree d divisors (dimension d).

    However, the question's reference to the Galois group G = Gal(k(C)/k(P^1)) strongly suggests
    that the answer comes from a deeper arithmetic principle, likely an analogue of the
    Chebotarev density theorem for function fields. These theorems state that points (or primes)
    are distributed evenly among |G| different classes defined by the Galois group action.

    In this context, belonging to the specific g^r_d corresponds to one of these |G| classes.
    Therefore, the proportion of points that fall into this specific class approaches 1/|G|.
    The final equation for the ratio is determined by this principle.
