# The structure of the formula requires nesting countermodels.
# Let P(i) = (A_i -> B_i) v (~A_i -> B_i)
# The main formula is F = ( (P(0) -> B_1) ^ (P(1) -> B_2) ) -> B_2

# Step 1: Falsify F at a root node w0.
# This requires a state (let's say w0 itself) where the antecedent is true and B_2 is false.
# w0 forces (P(0) -> B_1) and (P(1) -> B_2), but not B_2.
num_nodes_level_0 = 1
root_node = "w0"

# Step 2: From (w0 forces P(1) -> B_2) and (w0 does not force B_2), we deduce that w0 cannot force P(1).
# To make P(1) false at w0, we need to make both of its disjuncts false.
# This requires w0 to have two successors:
# - one successor (w1) where A_1 is true and B_1 is false.
# - one successor (w2) where ~A_1 is true and B_1 is false.
# These two successors must be distinct from the root and from each other.
num_successors_for_p1 = 2
num_nodes_level_1 = num_successors_for_p1
level_1_nodes = ["w1", "w2"]

# Step 3: Now consider the other part of the antecedent: w0 forces (P(0) -> B_1).
# This property must be inherited by all successors of w0.
# So, w1 and w2 must also force (P(0) -> B_1).
# From Step 2, we know that w1 and w2 do not force B_1.
# Therefore, to satisfy the implication, neither w1 nor w2 can force P(0).

# Step 4: To make P(0) false at w1, w1 must have two distinct successors.
# To make P(0) false at w2, w2 must also have two distinct successors.
num_successors_for_p0 = 2
num_nodes_level_2 = num_nodes_level_1 * num_successors_for_p0
level_2_nodes = ["w11", "w12", "w21", "w22"]

# Step 5: The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes at all levels.
# These sets of nodes must be disjoint to satisfy all logical constraints.
total_nodes = num_nodes_level_0 + num_nodes_level_1 + num_nodes_level_2
