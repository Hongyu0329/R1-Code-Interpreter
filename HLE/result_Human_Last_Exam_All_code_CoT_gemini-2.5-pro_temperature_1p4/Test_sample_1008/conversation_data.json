    "In a dance scene within a film, the hierarchy of sound is dictated by what is most essential to the storytelling and emotional impact of the dance itself. My plan is to rank the three given elements—music, sound effects, and speech—based on this principle and then generate a simple Python script to print the final ranked order.\n\n1.  **Music:** This is almost invariably the most important element. It provides the rhythm, tempo, and emotional core that the dance is built upon. The choreography exists to interpret the music, making it the foundational layer of the scene.\n2.  **Sound Effects (SFX):** These are the sounds generated by the dance itself—footsteps, the swish of a dress, taps on the floor, or the ambient sounds of the environment. SFX ground the dance in physical reality, adding texture and authenticity to the movements. They are directly tied to the action and are often more critical than dialogue.\n3.  **Speech:** Dialogue is frequently absent or minimal during a core dance sequence. The focus is on non-verbal expression through movement and music. While characters might speak before or after (or even briefly during) a dance, the speech itself is typically the least critical sound element to the integrity of the *dance* portion of the scene.\n\nBased on this, the hierarchy is Music, followed by Sound Effects, and finally Speech. The Python code below will print this order.\n\n```python\ndef get_sound_hierarchy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in a film's dance scene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The elements are ordered from most important to least important.\n    hierarchy = [\"Music\", \"Sound Effects\", \"Speech\"]\n    \n    # The final ranked list, formatted as requested.\n    print(\"The hierarchy of sound importance in a dance scene is:\")\n    print(\", \".join(hierarchy))\n\nget_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
