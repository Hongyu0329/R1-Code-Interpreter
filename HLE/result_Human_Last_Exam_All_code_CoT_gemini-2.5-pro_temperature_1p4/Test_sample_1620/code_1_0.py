    public_safety_exception = "This duty is not absolute. An exception allows a lawyer to disclose confidential information if they have a reasonable belief of an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm to an identifiable person."

        "Did James have a 'reasonable belief' of 'imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm'?":
            "Yes. Eric's statement was specific ('I bought a gun,' 'going to my wife’s apartment tonight to end things for both of us'). This is a clear, credible, and imminent threat.",

        "Was disclosure permitted?":
            "Yes, based on the public safety exception, James was permitted to break confidentiality to prevent a likely murder-suicide.",

        "Did James disclose the 'appropriate information'?":
            "This is the key issue. A lawyer must disclose no more than is necessary.\n"
            "  - Necessary: Eric's name, his address, his ex-wife’s address. This is required for the police to intervene.\n"
            "  - Likely Unnecessary: The addresses of vacation properties in Florida. This information is not required to prevent a threat happening *tonight* in Windsor, Ontario.",

        "Conclusion":
            "Because James disclosed more information than was necessary to prevent the imminent harm, his disclosure was overly broad and therefore not fully in accordance with his professional obligations. The right to disclose existed, but he exercised it improperly."
