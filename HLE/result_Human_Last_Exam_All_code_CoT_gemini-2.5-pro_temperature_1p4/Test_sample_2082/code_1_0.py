        "Here is a breakdown of why:\n"
        f"A. {options['A']}: Correct. Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. Calcium is required for the contraction of smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels. By competing with calcium and preventing its entry into these cells, magnesium promotes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. This leads to the widening of blood vessels (vasodilation), which reduces peripheral resistance and lowers blood pressure.\n\n"
        f"B. {options['B']}: Incorrect. While magnesium's role as a calcium antagonist may have long-term benefits in preventing arterial calcification and stiffness, the primary and more immediate effect on blood pressure is direct vasodilation.\n\n"
        f"C. {options['C']}: Incorrect. Magnesium is important for brain health and neurologic function, but this is not the mechanism for blood pressure regulation.\n\n"
        f"D. {options['D']}: Incorrect. Stimulating an inflammatory response would likely worsen vascular health and contribute to hypertension, not alleviate it.\n\n"
        f"E. {options['E']}: Incorrect. Magnesium is a calcium antagonist, meaning it competes with and can block the effects of calcium. It does not raise systemic calcium levels."
