        "1. Populations with limited or no recombination are subject to a process called 'Muller's Ratchet', where deleterious (harmful) mutations accumulate over time because they cannot be easily removed by recombination.",
        "2. To counteract this genetic deterioration, a compensatory mechanism is needed. This mechanism should ideally provide a way to preserve essential gene function despite the accumulation of mutations.",
        "3. Let's evaluate the options:",
        "   - A, B, C: Tandem repeats, chromosomal inversions, and transposable elements are generally not mechanisms for preserving genetic integrity. In fact, inversions suppress recombination, and TEs can cause mutations.",
        "   - E: Polyploidy (whole genome duplication) provides redundancy, but 'multigene families' is a more specific and widely cited architectural feature for this compensatory role.",
        "   - D: Multigene families are groups of similar genes that arise from gene duplication. This provides crucial redundancy. If one gene copy is inactivated by a mutation, other functional copies can compensate. Furthermore, these multiple copies can facilitate a 'repair' process called gene conversion, where a functional gene copy is used as a template to fix a mutated one. This is a known feature on non-recombining Y chromosomes.",
        "4. Therefore, multigene families are the best-described intrinsic feature that compensates for genetic deterioration in low-recombination environments."
