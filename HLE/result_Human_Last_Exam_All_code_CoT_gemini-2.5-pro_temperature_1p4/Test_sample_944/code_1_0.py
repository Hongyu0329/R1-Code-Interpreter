def solve():
    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem about cyclic elements in a topological space.
    
    The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of points of a cyclic element S
    that also belong to some other cyclic element of X. Let this set be A(S).
    
    A key theorem by Claytor, Whyburn, and Ayres characterizes planar Peano continua. It states that
    a Peano continuum X is planar (embeddable in the 2-sphere) if and only if for every
    "true" cyclic element S, the cardinality of the set A(S) is no more than 2.
    
    A(S) is the set of points on S that are also on other cyclic elements. These are the
    cut points of the space X that lie on S.
    
    If we do not assume planarity, one can construct Peano continua where |A(S)| can be any
    finite number n, or even infinite. For instance, a central circle S with n other circles
    T_1, ..., T_n attached at n distinct points creates a space where |A(S)| = n. For n >= 3,
    this space is non-planar.
    
    Given that the question asks for "the maximum cardinality," this suggests a fundamental,
    universal bound. In topology, such questions often implicitly refer to the foundational
    planar case. In the planar case, the maximum is 2. Outside of the planar case, there is no
    finite maximum. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation of the question is that it is
    probing this fundamental result.
