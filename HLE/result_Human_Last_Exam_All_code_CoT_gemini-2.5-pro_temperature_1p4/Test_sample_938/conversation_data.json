    "My plan is to determine the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$ for large $n$. The behavior of the sequence $a_n$ is determined by the roots of its characteristic equation, $r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$. For large $n$, $a_n$ is approximately $c_1 R^n$, where $R$ is the root with the largest absolute value and $c_1$ is a constant determined by the initial conditions.\n\nThe expression for $s_n$ involves sums of terms like $a_{2k-3}$ and products like $a_{k+1}a_{k-2}$. For large $k$, these terms behave like $(c_1R)^{2k-3}$ and $(c_1R^k)^2 = c_1^2 R^{2k}$, respectively. A careful analysis shows which term in the expression for $s_n$ grows fastest as $n \\to \\infty$. This dominant term will determine the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$.\n\nMy analysis indicates that the term $-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} V_k$ dominates, specifically the part from the products of $a_k$. The sum grows asymptotically as $R^{2n-1}$. The overall expression for $s_n$ for large $n$ becomes:\n$s_n \\approx \\frac{c_1(1-3c_1)}{R^2-1} R^{2n-1}$.\n\nThe sign of $s_n$ for large $n$ depends on the sign of the coefficient $c_1(1-3c_1)$. If this is negative, $s_n$ is negative for large $n$, $\\ln(s_n)$ is not a real number, and the limit does not exist. In this case, the answer is $(-1)$. If the coefficient is positive, the limit is $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = 2 \\ln(R)$.\n\nThe Python code below will:\n1.  Numerically find the largest real root $R$ of the characteristic equation using Newton's method.\n2.  Calculate the coefficient $c_1$ using the formula $c_1 = -R^3 / (4R^3 - 88)$, which is derived from the initial conditions.\n3.  Determine the sign of the coefficient $c_1(1-3c_1)$.\n4.  If the sign is negative, it will print -1.\n5.  If the sign is positive, it will calculate the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot 2 \\ln(R)$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of s_n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
