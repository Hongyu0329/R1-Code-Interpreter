    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, for the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nSo, we need to solve the equation:\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic part is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThis gives us two equilibrium points: $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nLet $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if the derivative $f'(x^*)$ is less than zero.\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n*   For $x_1 = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point at $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   For $x_2 = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method. We can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$.\n    -   If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 < 0$. This means $x(t)$ will decrease towards 1.\n    -   If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 < 0$. This means $x(t)$ will decrease, moving away from 1.\n    Since solutions on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, it is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as semi-stable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point. So, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe need to calculate $m - 2^{4048}$. With $m=1$, the expression becomes $1 - 2^{4048}$. The following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\n# The number of stable equilibrium points, m, is 1.\nm = 1\n\n# Calculate 2 to the power of 4048. Python handles large integers automatically.\npower_of_two = 2**4048\n\n# Calculate the final result.\nresult = m - power_of_two\n\n# Print the final equation with each number.\nprint(f\"m = {m}\")\nprint(f\"The expression to calculate is: m - 2^4048\")\nprint(f\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{m} - {power_of_two} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<1 - 2**4048>>>"
