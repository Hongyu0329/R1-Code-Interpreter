    # Step 1: First Weighing
    # We weigh Group A against Group B.
    # Let's analyze the outcome where Group A is lighter than Group B (A < B).
    # This implies that the number of fake coins in A, f_A, is greater than in B, f_B.
    # f_A > f_B
    
    # Step 2: Second Weighing
    # We now test the groups that could be real: B and C.
    # We weigh Group B (333 coins) against a subgroup of C of the same size.
    # Let's call this subgroup C' (333 coins).
    # Let's analyze the outcome where Group B is heavier than Group C' (B > C').
    # This implies that the number of fake coins in B, f_B, is less than in C', f_C_prime.
    # f_B < f_C_prime
    
    # Step 3: Logical Deduction
    # Let's prove that this sequence of outcomes guarantees Group B is all real.
    # We assume for contradiction that Group B has at least one fake coin (f_B >= 1).
    
    # From f_A > f_B, and since the number of coins must be an integer,
    # if f_B >= 1, then f_A must be at least 2.

    # if f_B >= 1, then f_C_prime must be at least 2.
    min_f_C_prime_if_f_B_is_1 = 2
    
    # The total number of fake coins is the sum from all disjoint groups.
    # Total_fakes = f_A + f_B + f_C.
    # Since C' is a part of C, f_C is at least as large as f_C_prime.
    # So, minimum Total_fakes >= min_f_A + min_f_B + min_f_C_prime
    min_total_fakes_if_f_B_is_1 = min_f_A_if_f_B_is_1 + 1 + min_f_C_prime_if_f_B_is_1
    
    # The contradiction:
    # This minimum sum (5) is greater than the known total number of fake coins (4).
    # This means our assumption (f_B >= 1) must be false.
    # Therefore, f_B must be 0.
