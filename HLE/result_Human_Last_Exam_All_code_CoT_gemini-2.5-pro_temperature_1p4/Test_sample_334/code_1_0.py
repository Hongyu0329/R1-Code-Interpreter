def solve_biometric_challenge():
    """
    Analyzes the cybersecurity requirements for enhancing biometric authentication and determines the best solution from the given choices.

    The problem requires a solution that prevents spoofing and replay attacks,
    denies authentication for an unwilling (coerced) user, ensures the system
    remains secure even if biometric data is stolen, and applies to all biometric modalities.

    Evaluation of Options:
    - Options like Liveness Detection (D), Challenge-Response (F), and MFA (I) fail the coercion test, as a user under duress can be forced to comply.
    - Options like Hashing (J), Differential Privacy (B), and ZKPs (C) are strong on data protection but don't inherently stop a coerced user from authenticating in real-time.
    - Option N describes a theoretical 'perfect' module but relies on a fictional standard (FIPS Level 5) and is less of a single innovative strategy and more of a bundle of all possible technologies.

    The Winning Solution:
    - H. Adaptive Context-Aware Authentication is the superior choice. It uniquely and effectively addresses all requirements:
      1. Prevention of spoofing/replay: An attack from an unusual context (e.g., new device, foreign IP) can be flagged.
      2. Protection against coercion: This is the key strength. A user being coerced (e.g., kidnapped) will almost certainly be in an anomalous context (geolocation, time of day), which the system can detect and deny authentication.
      3. Resilience to data exposure: A stolen biometric template is of limited use to an attacker who cannot also replicate the legitimate user's context.
      4. General applicability: This contextual layer works with any underlying biometric modality.

    explanation = "Adaptive Context-Aware Authentication is the only solution that provides a robust and practical mechanism to address the difficult requirement of preventing authentication under coercion by analyzing signals like geolocation, IP address, and device integrity. It also enhances security against spoofing and makes stolen data less useful, fulfilling all the prompt's criteria."
