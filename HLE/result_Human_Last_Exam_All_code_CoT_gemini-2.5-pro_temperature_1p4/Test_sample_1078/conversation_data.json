    "The problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Structure of Weyl Groups:** A finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of such a product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible factors.\n2.  **Classification of Irreducible Weyl Groups:** The irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of simple Lie algebras: A_n (for n≥1), B_n (for n≥2), D_n (for n≥4), and the exceptional types E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2. We note that the Weyl group for C_n is isomorphic to that of B_n, so we only need to consider one of them (B_n). Also, for low ranks, W(A_3) is isomorphic to W(D_3), so we convenionally use D_n for n≥4.\n3.  **Identify Building Blocks for Rank 4:** We need to find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. We list the relevant irreducible groups by their rank:\n    *   **Rank 1:** A_1\n    *   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2, G_2\n    *   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3\n    *   **Rank 4:** A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n4.  **Count Combinations for each Partition of 4:** We will consider all integer partitions of 4 and count how many non-isomorphic Weyl groups correspond to each partition.\n    *   **Partition (4):** A single irreducible group of rank 4.\n    *   **Partition (3+1):** A product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   **Partition (2+2):** A product of two rank 2 groups. This is a combination with replacement.\n    *   **Partition (2+1+1):** A product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   **Partition (1+1+1+1):** A product of four rank 1 groups.\n5.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number is the sum of the counts from all partitions.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \n    The calculation is based on the classification of finite Weyl groups.\n    A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and\n    its rank is the sum of the ranks of its factors.
