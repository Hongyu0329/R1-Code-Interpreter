    "This problem requires us to trace the linguistic evolution of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb through its daughter languages in the Germanic family.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE Root:** We start with the given PIE form `*seh2gieti`. We'll identify the root and determine which grade (vowel variant) serves as the basis for the Proto-Germanic form. The Germanic verb 'to seek' is reconstructed as `*sōkjaną`, which points to the PIE o-grade `*sōg-`.\n2.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** We'll apply Grimm's Law, a set of major sound changes, to transform the PIE root `*sōg-` into its Proto-Germanic equivalent.\n    *   PIE `*s` remains `*s`.\n    *   PIE long vowel `*ō` remains `*ō`.\n    *   PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   This gives us the PGmc root `*sōk-`.\n3.  **Reconstruct the PGmc Verb Form:** We will reconstruct the 3rd person singular present tense form of this verb in Proto-Germanic, which would be `*sōkiþ`.\n4.  **PGmc to Daughter Languages:** We will apply the specific sound changes for Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German to the PGmc form `*sōkiþ` to find the final words. This involves processes like i-umlaut, the High German Consonant Shift, and changes to verb endings.\n\n```python\ndef solve_linguistic_evolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the evolution of a PIE word into Germanic languages.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"This script traces the PIE verb *seh2gieti to its reflexes in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Step 1: From PIE to Proto-Germanic ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Deriving the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) form from Proto-Indo-European (PIE).\\n\")\n    print(\"The PIE verb *seh2gieti ('(s)he's giving a sign') contains the root *seh₂g-.\")\n    print(\"The form that serves as the base for the Germanic verb 'to seek' is the o-grade of this root: PIE *sōg-.\")\n    print(\"\\nApplying Grimm's Law to PIE *sōg-:\")\n    print(\"  - PIE *s -> PGmc *s\")\n    print(\"  - PIE *ō -> PGmc *ō\")\n    print(\"  - PIE *g -> PGmc *k (voiced stop becomes voiceless stop)\")\n    print(\"\\nThis gives us the PGmc root *sōk-.
