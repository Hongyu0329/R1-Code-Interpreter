    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how a dyadic rational number (a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 2) is represented as a \"stalk\" in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Decompose the Number:** Any positive dyadic rational number can be split into its integer part and its fractional part. For a number `x`, we can write `x = N + f`, where `N` is the integer part and `f` is the fractional part.\n2.  **Integer Part Representation:** The integer part `N` is represented by a \"base\" stalk consisting of `N` red pieces.\n3.  **Fractional Part Representation:** The fractional part `f` can be written in the form `m / 2^k`. This part is represented by a \"flower\" made of `k` pieces (a mix of red and blue) placed on top of the base stalk. The value of `k` is determined by the denominator; specifically, `k = logâ‚‚(denominator)`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Pieces:** The total number of pieces needed is the sum of the pieces for the integer part (`N`) and the pieces for the fractional part (`k`).\n5.  **Apply to $\\frac{13}{16}$:**\n    *   Integer part: `N = 13 // 16 = 0`. So, 0 pieces for the base.\n    *   Fractional part: The denominator is `16`. Since `16 = 2^4`, the value of `k` is 4. So, 4 pieces are needed for the flower.\n    *   Total pieces = `0 + 4 = 4`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces(numerator, denominator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces needed to represent a dyadic rational\n    in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n    Args:\n        numerator (int): The numerator of the fraction.\n        denominator (int): The denominator of the fraction (must be a power of 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    if denominator <= 0 or (denominator & (denominator - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: The denominator must be a positive power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # 1. The number of pieces for the integer part is the integer value itself.\n    integer_part_pieces = numerator // denominator\n\n    # 2. The number of pieces for the fractional part m/2^k is k.\n    # We find k by taking the base-2 logarithm of the denominator.\n    fractional_part_pieces = int(math.log2(denominator))\n\n    # 3. The total number of pieces is the sum of the two parts.\n    total_pieces = integer_part_pieces + fractional_part_pieces\n\n    print(f\"For the number {numerator}/{denominator}:\")\n    print(f\"The number of pieces for the integer part ({integer_part_pieces}) is: {integer_part_pieces}\")\n    print(f\"The number of pieces for the fractional part is: {fractional_part_pieces}\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for the total number of pieces is: {integer_part_pieces} + {fractional_part_pieces} = {total_pieces}\")\n    print(f\"Total pieces needed: {total_pieces}\")\n\n\n# Solve for the specific number 13/16\nsolve_hackenbush_pieces(13, 16)\n\n<<<4>>>\n```"
