    print(f"The problem is to find the minimum number of prototypes, let's call it M, required to guarantee")
    print(f"that a distance-weighted soft-label kNN classifier can correctly classify each of the {C_symbol} class centroids.")
    print("A 'guarantee' means the method must work for ANY valid arrangement of the class centroids.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the case where the number of prototypes is less than the number of classes (M < C)")
    print("To prove that M < C is NOT sufficient, we only need to find one scenario where it fails.")
    print("Let's consider the simplest kNN setting, with k=1. In this case, a query point is classified according to its single nearest prototype.")
    print("This effectively divides the space into M regions (known as Voronoi cells), one for each prototype.")
    print(f"We have {C_symbol} centroids to classify, but only M regions to classify them into.")
    print(f"Since M is strictly less than {C_symbol}, the 'pigeonhole principle' states that at least one region must contain two or more centroids.")
    print("For example, if Centroid_A and Centroid_B are both closest to Prototype_1, the k=1 classifier will assign them both the class label associated with Prototype_1.")
    print("Since Centroid_A and Centroid_B belong to different classes, this classification must be incorrect for at least one of them.")
    print("Therefore, any number of prototypes M < C is insufficient to guarantee correct classification.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyzing the case where the number of prototypes equals the number of classes (M = C)")
    print("Now let's check if M = C is sufficient. We need to show there's a strategy that always works.")
    print("Consider the following strategy for placing the prototypes:")
    print(f"For each class 'i' (from 1 to {C_symbol}), we place one prototype, Prototype_i, exactly at the location of its centroid, Centroid_i.")
    print("\nNow, let's evaluate this setup:")
    print("  - Prototype Labels: The soft label for Prototype_i is based on its proximity to all centroids. Since it's at Centroid_i (distance 0) and far from all other centroids, its label will overwhelmingly indicate class 'i'. In the ideal case, the label is a vector where the i-th component is 1 and all others are 0.")
    print("  - Classification: Let's use a k=1 classifier to classify Centroid_i. The nearest prototype to Centroid_i is, by our construction, Prototype_i.")
    print("  - Result: The classifier predicts the label of Prototype_i, which correctly identifies the class as 'i'.")
    print("\nThis strategy works for every single one of the C centroids.")
    print(f"Therefore, M = {C_symbol} prototypes are sufficient to guarantee correct classification.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print("We have demonstrated that M < C is insufficient and M = C is sufficient.")
    print("The minimum number of prototypes required is exactly C.")
    
    print("\nFinal Answer Equation:")
