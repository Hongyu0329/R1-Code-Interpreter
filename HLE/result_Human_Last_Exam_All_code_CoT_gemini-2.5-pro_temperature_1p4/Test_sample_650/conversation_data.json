    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze how the number of operations grows as the input size `n` increases.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Core Logic:** The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while` loop, as the steps before and after it are constant-time operations.\n2.  **Analyze the Loop's Duration:** We will examine the condition `q > 0` and how the value of `q` changes with each iteration.\n3.  **Trace the Variable `q`:** The variable `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`. Inside the loop, `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that in each iteration, the value of the variable that determines the loop's continuation is divided by `c`.\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Iterations:** The loop will run as many times as we can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0. This is precisely the definition of the logarithm. The number of iterations is therefore proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n5.  **Analyze Operations Inside the Loop:** The operations inside the loop (`i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, `a_i := x - qc`) are all basic arithmetic operations. They take a constant amount of time for each iteration.\n6.  **Combine the Analyses:** The total time complexity will be the number of iterations multiplied by the constant time work performed in each iteration. This gives us a complexity of `O(log_c(n))`. By the change of base formula for logarithms, this is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe following Python script will print this detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Computational Time Complexity Analysis of IMAG(n, c):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 55)\n    \n    print(\"1.

The number of times you can divide 'n' by 'c' until the result is less than 1 is the definition of log_c(n).\")\n    print(\"   - Therefore, the loop runs approximately log_c(n) times.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n4.
