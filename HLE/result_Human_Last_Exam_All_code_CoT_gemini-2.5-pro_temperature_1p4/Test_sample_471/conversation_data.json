    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process followed by the code to solve the problem.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function mapping a 2-torus ($T^2$) to the real numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$). A critical point is a location where the function's derivative (gradient) is zero.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Concept:** This problem belongs to the field of differential topology, specifically **Morse Theory**. Morse theory provides a powerful connection between the topology of a manifold (like the torus) and the critical points of functions defined on it.\n\n3.  **Apply Morse Theory:** A fundamental result derived from Morse theory states that for any smooth function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points must be at least the sum of the manifold's Betti numbers. The Betti numbers, denoted $b_k(M)$, are topological invariants that, in simple terms, count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions in the manifold.\n    *   The inequality is: (Number of critical points) $\\ge \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim M} b_k(M)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Betti Numbers for the Torus ($T^2$):** The 2-torus is a 2-dimensional manifold. We need its Betti numbers, $b_0$, $b_1$, and $b_2$.\n    *   $b_0$: This counts the number of connected components. A torus is one single piece, so $b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_1$: This counts the number of 1-dimensional \"holes\" or independent loops. A torus has two such loops: one going around the \"donut\" the long way (longitudinal) and one going through the hole (meridional). So, $b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $b_2$: This counts the number of 2-dimensional \"voids\" or enclosed volumes. A torus encloses a single void. So, $b_2 = 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lower Bound:** Using the Betti numbers, we can find the theoretical lower bound for the number of critical points.\n    *   Lower Bound = $b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n    *   This means any smooth function on a torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n\n6.  **Verify the Minimum:** The theory gives us a lower bound of 4. To confirm that this is the *minimal* number, we must show that it is achievable. We need to find an actual function on the torus that has exactly 4 critical points.\n\n7.  **Construct an Example Function:** A simple way to define a function on a torus is to use a doubly periodic function on the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Let's consider the function $f(x, y) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(y)$ on the square $[0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$ with opposite sides identified.\n    *   **Find Critical Points:** The critical points occur where the gradient $\\nabla f = (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y})$ is zero.\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -\\sin(x) = 0 \\implies x=0$ or $x=\\pi$.\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -\\sin(y) = 0 \\implies y=0$ or $y=\\pi$.\n        *   This gives us four critical points in the domain: $(0,0)$, $(0,\\pi)$, $(\\pi,0)$, and $(\\pi,\\pi)$.\n    *   **Classify Critical Points:** We use the Hessian matrix of second derivatives to classify them as minima, maxima, or saddle points. The analysis shows that this function has one local maximum, one local minimum, and two saddle points.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** We have established a theoretical lower bound of 4 and found a function that achieves this bound. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n9.  **Plan the Code:** The Python code will formalize these steps. It will:\n    *   State the Betti numbers for the torus.\n    *   Calculate their sum to show the lower bound is 4.\n    *   Define the example function $f(x, y) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(y)$ using the `sympy` library.\n    *   Symbolically find the critical points and classify them to demonstrate that a function with exactly 4 critical points exists.\n    *   Print the results clearly, including the equation showing the sum of Betti numbers.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures we arrive at the correct answer, backed by both theory and a concrete example.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# The problem asks for the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R.\n# We will solve this using a key result from Morse Theory and then verify it with a concrete example.\n\n# --- Step 1: Use Morse Theory to find the lower bound ---\n# Morse theory relates the number of critical points of a function on a manifold\n# to the manifold's Betti numbers.\n# The number of critical points is always greater than or equal to the sum of the Betti numbers.\n\n# The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2) are well-known:\n# b_0: number of connected components\n# b_1: number of 1-dimensional \"handles\" or loops\n# b_2: number of 2-dimensional \"voids\"\nb0 = 1\nb1 = 2\nb2 = 1\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Find the theoretical lower bound using Morse Theory.\")\nprint(\"The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\")\nprint(f\"b_0 = {b0}\")\nprint(f\"b_1 = {b1}\")\nprint(f\"b_2 = {b2}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# The minimal number of critical points must be at least the sum of these numbers.\nmin_critical_points_bound = b0 + b1 + b2\n\nprint(\"The minimal number of critical points (N_crit) is bounded by the sum of Betti numbers:\")\nprint(\"N_crit >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2\")\nprint(f\"N_crit >= {b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_critical_points_bound}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n\n# --- Step 2: Show this minimum is achievable with an example ---\n# To prove that 4 is the minimum, we must find a function that has exactly 4 critical points.\n# Consider the function f(x, y) = cos(x) + cos(y) on the torus,\n# represented by the square [0, 2*pi] x [0, 2*pi] with periodic boundaries.\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Construct a function that achieves this bound.\")\nprint(\"Example function: f(x, y) = cos(x) + cos(y)\")\nprint(\"We find its critical points in the domain [0, 2*pi) x [0, 2*pi).\")\nprint(\"Critical points occur where the gradient is zero: [-sin(x), -sin(y)] = [0, 0]\")\n\n# Define symbolic variables and the function\nx, y = sp.symbols('x y')\nf = sp.cos(x) + sp.cos(y)\n\n# The solutions for sin(x)=0 and sin(y)=0 in the domain are {0, pi}.\n# This gives us 4 critical points.\ncritical_points = [(0, 0), (0, sp.pi), (sp.pi, 0), (sp.pi, sp.pi)]\nprint(f\"\\nThe critical points (x, y) are: {[(p[0], str(p[1])) for p in critical_points]}\")\n\n# Compute the Hessian matrix to classify the points\nhessian_f = sp.hessian(f, (x, y))\n\n# Classify each critical point by checking the eigenvalues of the Hessian\npoint_types = []\nfor p in critical_points:\n    hess_at_p = hessian_f.subs({x: p[0], y: p[1]})\n    eigenvals = list(hess_at_p.eigenvals().keys())\n    if all(e > 0 for e in eigenvals):\n        point_types.append(\"Local Minimum\")\n    elif all(e < 0 for e in eigenvals):\n        point_types.append(\"Local Maximum\")\n    else:\n        point_types.append(\"Saddle Point\")\n\nprint(\"\\nClassification of critical points:\")\nfor p, ptype in zip(critical_points, point_types):\n     print(f\"  Point ({str(p[0]).ljust(3)}, {str(p[1]).ljust(3)}): {ptype}\")\n\nnum_critical_points = len(critical_points)\nprint(f\"\\nThis function has a total of {num_critical_points} critical points.\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion: Since theory proves the minimum is at least 4, and we found a function with exactly 4, the minimal number is 4.\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
