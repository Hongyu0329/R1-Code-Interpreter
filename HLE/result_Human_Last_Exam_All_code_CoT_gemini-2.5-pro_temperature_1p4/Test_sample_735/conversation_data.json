    "To find the number of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3, we need to consult the mathematical literature, as this is a complex classification problem that has been studied by specialists. The definitive work on this question appears to be the paper \"Finite groups containing a maximal product-free set of size 3\" by S. C. Anabanti and S. B. Hart, published in 2020.\n\nA product-free set `S` in a group `G` is a subset such that for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `ab` is not in `S`. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it cannot be extended by adding any element from the group without losing the product-free property.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned paper, there are exactly 16 such non-isomorphic groups. The problem of verifying each case is highly complex and involves detailed case-by-case analysis of group structures, and there appear to be some inconsistencies in the literature. However, the result from this recent peer-reviewed paper is the current academic consensus.\n\nThe following Python code stores the list of these 16 groups and prints the total count, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_classification_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the solution to the question of how many finite groups\n    contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.\n\n    The solution is based on the classification found in the mathematical paper:\n    Anabanti, S.
