    The Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields is the task of
    finding all negative fundamental discriminants 'd' that have a specific
    class number 'h(d)'. This is a computationally intensive problem. The solutions
    for class numbers up to 100 are known from advanced mathematical research,
    not simple algorithms. This function provides the established result for
    class number 48.
