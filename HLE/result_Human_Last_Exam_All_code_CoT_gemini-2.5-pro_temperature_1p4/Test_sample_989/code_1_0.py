    print("Analysis of Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("  - In the SVM dual formulation, a key constraint is that the sum of the products of Lagrange multipliers (alpha_i) and class labels (y_i) must be zero: sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0.")
    print("  - The support vectors are the data points for which alpha_i > 0.")
    print("  - If all support vectors were from a single class (e.g., y_i = +1 for all of them), the constraint would become sum(alpha_i * 1) = 0.")
    print("  - Since alpha_i must be non-negative, the only way their sum can be zero is if all alpha_i are zero. This corresponds to a trivial solution (w=0), not a valid separator.")
    print("  - Therefore, there must be support vectors from both classes.")
    print("  - Verdict: Statement A is TRUE.")
    print("-" * 70)

    print("Analysis of Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("  - Yes, this is a standard technique. In soft-margin SVM, one can use different penalty parameters (C) for each class.")
    print("  - By assigning a larger C value to the minority class, we penalize misclassifications of that class more heavily.")
    print("  - This leads to an optimal decision boundary that is closer to the majority class, effectively creating unequal margins to better protect the minority class.")
    print("  - Verdict: Statement B is TRUE.")
    print("-" * 70)

    print("Analysis of Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("  - This is the essence of the 'kernel trick'. The kernel function calculates dot products of vectors in a high-dimensional feature space without explicitly computing the mapping.")
    print("  - The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, K(x, y) = exp(-gamma * ||x-y||^2), is a prime example. Its corresponding feature space is infinite-dimensional.")
    print("  - The SVM algorithm only needs the value of K(x, y), making the computation tractable.")
    print("  - Verdict: Statement C is TRUE.")
    print("-" * 70)

    print("Analysis of Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("  - The SVM's decision boundary and margins are determined *only* by the support vectors.")
    print("  - Data points that are correctly classified and lie outside the margin ('interior points') have their corresponding Lagrange multipliers (alpha_i) equal to zero.")
    print("  - Since these points have no weight in the model's solution, adding, moving, or removing them (as long as they don't cross the margin and become support vectors) has no effect on the decision boundary.")
    print("  - Verdict: Statement D is TRUE.")
    print("-" * 70)

    print("Analysis of Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("  - This is a general statement from optimization theory, and it is false.")
    print("  - While it is true that IF a strictly convex function has a global minimum, it must be unique, the existence of a minimum is not guaranteed.")
    print("  - Counterexample: The function f(x) = e^x.")
    print("    - Its second derivative is f''(x) = e^x, which is always positive, so the function is strictly convex.")
    print("    - However, the function's value is always greater than 0 and approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity. The infimum (greatest lower bound) is 0.")
    print("    - There is no real number x for which e^x = 0. The function never attains its infimum.")
    print("    - Therefore, f(x) = e^x is a strictly convex function with no global minimizer.")
    print("  - Verdict: Statement E is FALSE.")
    print("-" * 70)

    print("\nConclusion: Based on the analysis, statement E is the one that is not true.")
