    # (4) Virtual cohomological dimension of G
    # G = C_2*C_2*C_2*C_2. It is a free product of finite groups, and it is infinite.
    # It acts on a 1-dimensional tree with finite stabilizers. So vcd(G) = 1.

    # (5) Number of ends of H
    # A group has 2 ends if and only if it is virtually Z. H is virtually Z.

    # G = H * H is a non-trivial free product of two infinite groups.
    # By Stallings' theorem, it has infinitely many ends.

    # (7) Cohomological dimension of P
    # P is the pro-p completion of G for an odd prime p.
    # Any homomorphism from G to a finite p-group is trivial because the generators of G have order 2.
    # So P is the trivial group. cd(trivial group) = 0.

    # (8) Virtual cohomological dimension of P
    # Since P is the trivial group, its vcd is also 0.
    ans8 = 0

    # (9) Dimension of H^1(G, F_p)
    # H^1(G, F_p) is Hom(G_ab, F_p). G_ab is (C_2)^4.
    # For odd prime p, Hom(C_2, F_p) is trivial.
    # So Hom((C_2)^4, F_p) is trivial, and its dimension is 0.
