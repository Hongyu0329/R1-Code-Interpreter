    Calculates the n-compactness number for X = [0,1]^3.

    The space X is the unit cube in 3 dimensions, [0,1]^3.
    The value [X] represents the n-compactness number of X, which is the minimum n
    such that there exists an open sub-basis where every cover has a subcover
    of size at most n.

    For compact metric spaces like the unit cube, there is a theorem relating this
    number to the covering dimension (dim) of the space:
    [X] = dim(X) + 1

    The covering dimension of the d-dimensional cube [0,1]^d is d.
