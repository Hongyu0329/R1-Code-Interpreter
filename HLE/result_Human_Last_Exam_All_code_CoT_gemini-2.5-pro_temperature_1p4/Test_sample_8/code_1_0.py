def solve_conormal_space():
    """
    This function determines the conormal space for the resolvent applied to the function f.
    
    The problem specifies:
    - f is in the conormal space A^{2+alpha}(X), with alpha in (0, 1).
    - We want to find the space for u = R(sigma)f, where R(sigma) is the resolvent of the wave operator.
    - This corresponds to solving the Helmholtz-type equation (Delta_g + sigma^2)u = f on an asymptotically flat space.

    The solution u has two conceptual components:
    1. A homogeneous part u_h satisfying the radiation condition, which behaves like e^(i*sigma*r)/r. Its amplitude decays as r^-1. This corresponds to the space A^1(X).
    2. A particular part u_p driven by the source f. Its decay matches the decay of f / sigma^2, which is r^-(2+alpha). This corresponds to the space A^{2+alpha}(X).
    
    The overall decay of u is determined by the slowest decaying component.
    We compare the decay rates r^-1 and r^-(2+alpha).
    Since alpha is in (0, 1), 2+alpha is in (2, 3).
    Because 2+alpha > 1, the term r^-1 decays slower than r^-(2+alpha).
    
    Therefore, the solution u is dominated by the r^-1 behavior.
