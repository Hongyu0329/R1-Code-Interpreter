# The specific ballet step in question is the "pas de Balanchine."
# The choreography is William Forsythe's "In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated."
# Forsythe's style is a deconstruction of classical ballet and does not typically
# include direct quotations of signature steps from other choreographers like Balanchine.
# Therefore, after a choreographic analysis, we can determine the number of formal
# pas de Balanchines performed in the solo.

pas_de_balanchines_performed = 0

# The equation is simply stating the final count.
# We will print the result clearly.
print(f"Number of pas de Balanchines = {pas_de_balanchines_performed}")
