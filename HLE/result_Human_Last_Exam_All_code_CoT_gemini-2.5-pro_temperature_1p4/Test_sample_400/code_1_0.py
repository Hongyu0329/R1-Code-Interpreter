# This script calculates the number of connected components for the given space.

# Step 1: Define the components.
# The space consists of line segments that are all joined at the origin (0,0).
# When the origin is removed, these segments are no longer connected to each other.
# The remaining pieces are the connected components.

# Step 2: Count the components.
# We have one component from the line segment L, which was on the x-axis.
num_components_from_L = 1

# We have one component for each line segment L_n, where n is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).
# The number of positive integers is infinite.
# We will represent this with a string for clarity in the output.
num_components_from_Ln_description = "the number of positive integers (infinitely many)"

# Step 3: Formulate the final "equation" to find the total number of components.
# The total number is the sum of the component from L and the components from all the L_n's.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.

print("To find the total number of connected components, we sum the number of individual components:")
print("\nTotal Components = (Number of components from L) + (Number of components from each L_n)")
print(f"Breaking this down:")
# Printing the "numbers" of the equation
print(f"Number of components from L = {num_components_from_L}")
print(f"Number of components from L_n = {num_components_from_Ln_description}")

print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"Total Components = {num_components_from_L} + infinity")
print("\nThis sum is infinite. Therefore, the space has a countably infinite number of connected components.")
