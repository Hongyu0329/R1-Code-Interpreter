    # Statement A
    print(f"A. L can be given the structure of an immersed submanifold of R^{r_dim} with boundary.")
    print("This is TRUE.")
    print("An immersed submanifold is the image of a smooth immersion f: M -> N. We can construct a suitable manifold with boundary, M, and an immersion f.")

    print("The potential problem is at t_0 where x(t_0) = 0 (the origin of L). For y(t) = |x(t)| to be smooth at t_0, the function x(t) must be 'flat' (i.e., x and all its derivatives must be zero at t_0).")
    print("Using functions like f(t) = exp(-1/t^2), it is possible to construct a smooth function x(t) that maps R surjectively to R and is flat at its zero.")

    # Statement C

    print("This is FALSE.")
    print("A diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism. This means the two spaces must have the same topological properties.")
    print("The set L, with its subspace topology from R^2, is homeomorphic to the real line R, which is a non-compact space.")

    print("The real numbers with the operation of addition, (R, +), form a 1-dimensional Lie group, as addition and negation are smooth maps.")
    print("Since L can be made diffeomorphic to R, it can be given a structure that makes it diffeomorphic to the Lie group (R, +).\n")

    # Statement E
    print("E. There exists a unique z in L such that L \\ {z} can be given the structure of a smooth manifold.")
    print("This is TRUE.")
    print(f"We interpret 'can be given the structure of a smooth manifold' as 'is a smooth submanifold of R^{r_dim}'.")
    print(f"The set L fails to be a smooth submanifold of R^{r_dim} only at the 'kink' at the origin, z_0 = (0, 0). At any other point, L is locally a straight line.")
    print("If we remove the origin, the set L \\ {z_0} consists of two disjoint open rays. This set is a smooth 1-dimensional submanifold of R^2.")
    print("If we remove any other point z != z_0, the origin remains in the set L \\ {z}, so it is still not a smooth submanifold due to the persistent kink.")
    print(f"Thus, the point z = (0,0) is unique in this respect.\n")
