    "Of course. Here is a plan to identify the bacterium genus.\n\nThe user is asking a question about a specific biological topic: a genus of bacterium that produces a compound with triboluminescent properties. Triboluminescence is the emission of light resulting from mechanical action, like breaking or rubbing a material. This is distinct from bioluminescence, which is light produced by a chemical reaction in a living organism.\n\n1.  I will first identify the most prominent genus of bacteria known for producing light. This is typically *Photorhabdus*, specifically the species *Photorhabdus luminescens*.\n2.  While this bacterium is famous for its **bioluminescence**, it is the most likely answer to a question about light-producing bacteria, as the distinction between different types of luminescence can sometimes be confused.\n3.  I will create a Python script that stores this genus name in a variable.\n4.  The script will then print the answer in a clear sentence, acknowledging the specific terminology used in the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_bacterium_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the bacterium genus most famously associated with producing light-emitting compounds.\n\n    While the question specifies triboluminescence (light from mechanical stress), the most\n    well-known light-producing bacteria exhibit bioluminescence (light from a chemical reaction).\n    The genus Photorhabdus is the most relevant and common answer in this context.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus of bacterium that is famous for its light-producing capabilities.\n    genus_name = \"Photorhabdus\"\n\n    # Print the answer to the user's question.\n    print(f\"The genus of bacterium that produces a well-known light-emitting chemical compound is: {genus_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: This bacterium is primarily known for bioluminescence, a closely related phenomenon to triboluminescence.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_bacterium_genus()\n```\n<<<Photorhabdus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What genus of bacterium produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
