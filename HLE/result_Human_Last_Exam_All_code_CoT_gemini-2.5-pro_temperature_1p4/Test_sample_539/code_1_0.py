    print("\nStep 1: Understand the notation in terms of logic.")
    print("The statement 'G and H are indistinguishable by the k-dimensional WL algorithm' (G_equiv_k H) is equivalent to saying 'G and H are logically equivalent in the logic C^{k+1}'.")
    print("C^{k+1} is first-order logic with counting quantifiers, restricted to k+1 variables.")
    print("So, the given condition is: G is equivalent to H in C^{k+1}.")

    print("\nStep 2: State the relevant theorem (Feferman-Vaught Theorem for C^{k+1}).")

    print("then the tensor product (G1 tensor G2) is equivalent to (H1 tensor H2) in C^{k+1}.")

    print("\nStep 3: Apply the theorem using mathematical induction to find the relationship for G^l and H^l.")
