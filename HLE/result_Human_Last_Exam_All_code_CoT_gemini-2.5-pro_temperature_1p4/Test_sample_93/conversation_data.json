    "To solve this problem, I will find the number of ordered tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the given Diophantine equation.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  The problem asks for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. This is equivalent to finding the number of ordered 5-tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the condition.\n2.  A brute-force approach with five nested loops would be too computationally expensive, as each variable can range from 0 to $\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44$.\n3.  I will use a more efficient method: recursion with memoization. This dynamic programming technique will avoid recomputing results for the same subproblems.\n4.  I will create a function, let's call it `count_solutions(target, num_vars)`, which computes the number of ways a `target` integer can be expressed as the sum of `num_vars` squares of non-negative integers.\n5.  The function will work as follows:\n    *   It will iterate through all possible values for one variable, say $x_k$, from 0 up to `floor(sqrt(target))`.\n    *   For each value of $x_k$, it will make a recursive call to find the number of solutions for the remaining `num_vars - 1` variables and the new target value of `target - x_k^2`.\n    *   The total count is the sum of the results from these recursive calls.\n    *   The recursion's base case is when `num_vars` becomes 0. If the `target` is also 0, we have found one valid solution (the empty set sum); otherwise, it's impossible.\n    *   A dictionary will be used for memoization to store and retrieve the results for each `(target, num_vars)` state, significantly speeding up the calculation.\n6.  Finally, I will call this function with the initial values from the problem: `target = 2024` and `num_vars = 5` and print the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# A dictionary to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\nmemo = {}\n\ndef count_solutions(target, num_vars):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively counts the number of non-negative integer solutions to\n    the sum of num_vars squares equaling the target.\n    Uses memoization to store results of subproblems.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the result for this state (target, num_vars) is already computed.\n    if (target, num_vars) in memo:\n        return memo[(target, num_vars)]\n\n    # Base case: If we need to find a sum with 0 variables,\n    # it's only possible if the target is also 0.
