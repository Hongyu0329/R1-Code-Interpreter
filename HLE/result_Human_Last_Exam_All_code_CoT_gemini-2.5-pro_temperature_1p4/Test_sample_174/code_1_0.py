# The goal is to compute the orbifold Euler characteristic of [U/G], the moduli stack
# of smooth plane quartic curves, which we denote chi(M_3^{pq}).

# --- Step 1: The main formula ---
# The moduli stack of smooth genus 3 curves, M_3, is the disjoint union of the stack of
# smooth plane quartics (M_3^{pq}) and the stack of hyperelliptic genus 3 curves (H_3).
# The additivity of the Euler characteristic on stratifications gives:
# chi(M_3) = chi(M_3^{pq}) + chi(H_3)
#
# We are looking for chi(M_3^{pq}), so we rearrange the formula:
# chi(M_3^{pq}) = chi(M_3) - chi(H_3)

print("The orbifold Euler characteristic of the stack of smooth plane quartics, chi([U/G]), can be found using the decomposition of the moduli space of genus 3 curves.")
print("The key equation is: chi([U/G]) = chi(M_3) - chi(H_3)")
print("where chi(M_3) is the Euler characteristic of the stack of all smooth genus 3 curves,")
print("and chi(H_3) is the Euler characteristic of the stack of hyperelliptic genus 3 curves.\n")

# --- Step 2: Calculate chi(M_3) ---
# We use the Harer-Zagier formula: chi(M_g) = -B_{2g} / (2g).
# For g=3, this is chi(M_3) = -B_6 / 6.
# The 6th Bernoulli number, B_6, is 1/42.

g = 3
# The Bernoulli number B_6
B6 = Fraction(1, 42)

# Calculate chi(M_3)
chi_M3 = -B6 / (2 * g)

print(f"Step 1: Calculating chi(M_3)")
print(f"Using the Harer-Zagier formula for g={g}: chi(M_3) = -B_{2*g} / (2*{g}) = -B_6 / 6.")
print(f"The 6th Bernoulli number B_6 = {B6}.")
print(f"So, chi(M_3) = -({B6}) / 6 = {chi_M3}.\n")


# --- Step 3: Find chi(H_3) ---
# From results on the cohomology of moduli spaces of hyperelliptic curves (e.g., by Bergstr√∂m),
# the class of H_3 in the Grothendieck ring of stacks is known to be
# [H_3] = L^5 + L^4 + L^3 - L - 1.
# The orbifold Euler characteristic is found by setting the Lefschetz motive L=1.
# chi(H_3) = 1^5 + 1^4 + 1^3 - 1 - 1 = 1.

print(f"The orbifold Euler characteristic of the stack of hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, chi(H_3), is a known result from its cohomological structure.")
print(f"The value is chi(H_3) = {chi_H3}.\n")


# --- Step 4: Compute the final result ---
chi_U_G = chi_M3 - chi_H3
