# The plan is to find the value of alpha in c_n = Theta(alpha^n).
# We determine alpha by establishing tight asymptotic lower and upper bounds for c_n.

# --- Lower Bound ---
# The value c_n is the completely bounded norm of the Schur multiplier operator for A_n.
# This norm is bounded below by the clique number, omega(G_n), of the graph G_n
# for which A_n is the adjacency matrix.
# A clique in G_n is an "intersecting family" of subsets of {1, ..., n}.
# The size of the largest such family is known to be 2**(n-1). A simple example
# is the family of all subsets containing a specific element.
# So, omega(G_n) = 2**(n-1).
# This gives the lower bound: c_n >= 2**(n-1).

# --- Upper Bound ---
# The value c_n is bounded above by the Frobenius norm of A_n, ||A_n||_F.
# ||A_n||_F^2 is the sum of the squares of the entries of A_n. Since A_n is a 0-1 matrix,
# this is simply the number of non-zero entries.
# A_n[S,T] is non-zero if S and T have a non-empty intersection.
# Number of non-zero entries = (Total pairs of subsets) - (Pairs with empty intersection)
# Total pairs = (2**n) * (2**n) = 4**n.
# Pairs with empty intersection for a given S is 2**(n-|S|). Summing over all S, we get
# sum_{k=0 to n} C(n,k) * 2**(n-k), which is (1+2)**n = 3**n by the binomial theorem.
# So, ||A_n||_F^2 = 4**n - 3**n.
# This gives the upper bound: c_n <= sqrt(4**n - 3**n).

# --- Asymptotic Analysis ---
# We have sandwiched c_n: 2**(n-1) <= c_n <= sqrt(4**n - 3**n).
# Let's look at the behavior for large n:
# Lower bound: 2**(n-1) = 0.5 * 2**n.
# Upper bound: sqrt(4**n * (1 - (3/4)**n)) = 2**n * sqrt(1 - (3/4)**n), which approaches 2**n.
# Since 0.5 * 2**n <= c_n <= (approx) 1 * 2**n, the growth rate is c_n = Theta(2**n).
# Comparing this with the given form c_n = Theta(alpha**n), we find alpha.
