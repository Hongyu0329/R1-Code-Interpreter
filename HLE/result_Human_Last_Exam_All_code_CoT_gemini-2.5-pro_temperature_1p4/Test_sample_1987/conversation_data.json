    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f`**: The recursive definition of `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` with its conditions (`0 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`) corresponds to a classic problem in combinatorics: counting lattice paths that are restricted to a certain region (a Weyl chamber). The number of such paths is given by the number of Standard Young Tableaux (SYT) for a specific shape.\n\n2.  **Find a closed-form formula**: The number of SYT for a shape (partition) `λ = (λ_1, λ_2, ..., λ_n)` where `λ_1 >= λ_2 >= ... >= λ_n >= 0` is given by the hook-length formula. For the function `f(a_1, ..., a_n)`, the corresponding partition is `λ = (a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)`. The formula is:\n    `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = (Σ a_i)! * Π_{1<=i<j<=n} (a_j - a_i + j - i) / Π_{i=1 to n} (a_i + n - j)!` where the partition is `(a_n, ..., a_1)` which requires careful index handling.\n    A more standard form using partition `λ = (λ_1, ..., λ_n)`:\n    `count(λ) = N! * Π_{1<=i<j<=n} (λ_i - λ_j + j - i) / Π_{i=1 to n} (λ_i + n - i)!` where `N = Σ λ_i`.\n    We will use this formula for all three calculations, as a direct recursive approach is too slow for the larger inputs.\n\n3.  **Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`**:\n    *   This is a 3-dimensional case, so `n=3`.\n    *   The arguments are `a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=5`.\n    *   The corresponding partition is `λ = (a_3, a_2, a_1) = (5, 4, 2)`.\n    *   Total number of cells `N = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n    *   Apply the formula to calculate the exact integer value.\n\n4.  **Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`**:\n    *   Here `n=3` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 9000`. Let `k=9000`.\n    *   The partition is a rectangle: `λ = (k, k, k)`.\n    *   The general formula simplifies for this special case to: `f(k,k,k) = 2 * (3k)! / (k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)!)`.\n    *   To compute this for `k=9000`, we'll use Python's arbitrary-precision integers and `math.comb` for efficiency to handle the very large numbers involved.\n\n5.  **Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`**:\n    *   Here `n=4` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = p`, where `p = 10^9 + 7` is a prime number.\n    *   The partition is `λ = (p, p, p, p)`.\n    *   The formula simplifies to `f(p,p,p,p) = 12 * (4p)! / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!)`.\n    *   To compute this modulo `p`, we analyze the powers of `p` in the numerator and denominator. Both have `p^4` as a factor. After canceling these, we compute the remaining expression modulo `p` using properties of factorials `mod p` (extensions of Wilson's Theorem).\n\nThis plan allows for efficient and accurate computation of all three required values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_syt(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Standard Young Tableaux for a given partition\n    using the hook-length formula.\n    partition is a tuple (lambda_1, lambda_2, ...) with lambda_1 >= lambda_2 >= ...\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(partition)\n    N = sum(partition)\n    \n    # Numerator part 1: N!\n    num1 = math.factorial(N)\n    \n    # Numerator part 2: product(lambda_i - lambda_j + j - i)\n    num2 = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            num2 *= (partition[i] - partition[j] + (j + 1) - (i + 1))\n            \n    # Denominator: product((lambda_i + n - i)!)\n    den = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        den *= math.factorial(partition[i] + n - (i + 1))\n        \n    return (num1 * num2) // den\n\ndef solve_part1():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates f(2, 4, 5).\n    This corresponds to the partition lambda = (5, 4, 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The partition is (a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)\n    a = (2, 4, 5)\n    partition = tuple(sorted(a, reverse=True))\n    return solve_syt(partition)\n\ndef solve_part2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates f(9000, 9000, 9000).\n    Uses the simplified formula for a rectangular k x n partition.\n    For n=3, f(k,k,k) = 2 * (3k)! / (k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)!)\n    This can be calculated as (2/((k+1)**2*(k+2))) * C(3k, k, k, k)\n    or 2 * C(3k, k) * C(2k, k) / ((k+1)**2 * (k+2))\n    \"\"\"\n    k = 9000\n    \n    # These will be very large numbers, Python's int handles them.\n    comb1 = math.comb(3 * k, k)\n    comb2 = math.comb(2 * k, k)\n    \n    numerator = 2 * comb1 * comb2\n    denominator = (k + 1)**2 * (k + 2)\n    \n    # The result is guaranteed to be an integer.\n    return numerator // denominator\n\ndef solve_part3():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates f(p, p, p, p) mod p for p = 10^9 + 7.\n    Uses the simplified formula for a k x n partition and modular arithmetic.\n    For n=4, f(k,k,k,k) = 12 * (4k)! / (k! * (k+1)! * (k+2)! * (k+3)!)\n    We need to evaluate this for k=p.\n    \"\"\"\n    # p-adic valuation of (4p)! is 4.\n    # p-adic valuation of (p!) * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)! is 1+1+1+1 = 4.\n    # The powers of p cancel out.
