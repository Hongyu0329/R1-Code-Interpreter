def solve_fortress_problem_sphere():
    """
    Calculates the number of guards for the fortress problem on a 3D sphere
    based on the likely interpretation of the problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of guards on the surface of a unit
    sphere required to observe the entire exterior. A strict interpretation leads
    to an infinite number of guards, as any finite number of tangent half-planes
    will form a polyhedron that is not fully contained within the sphere.

    A more plausible interpretation is to find the minimum number of guards needed
    to "cover all directions". This is equivalent to finding the minimum number of
    points on a sphere whose convex hull contains the origin in its interior.

    For a d-dimensional space, this number is d + 1.
