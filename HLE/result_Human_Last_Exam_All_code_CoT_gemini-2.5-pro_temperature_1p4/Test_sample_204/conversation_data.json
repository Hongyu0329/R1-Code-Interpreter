    "To find the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can use the topological definition of the Hopf charge. The Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere S².\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Choose two convenient points on the sphere S², for example, the South Pole `p_S = (0, 0, -1)` and an equatorial point `p_E = (1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  Find the set of points `(x, y, z)` in the 3D domain space that are mapped to `p_S`. This set forms a curve, which we'll call `C_S`.\n3.  Find the set of points `(x, y, z)` that are mapped to `p_E`. This set forms another curve, `C_E`.\n4.  Determine the linking number of these two curves, `Lk(C_S, C_E)`. The linking number is an integer and represents the Hopf charge.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these steps by solving the equations that define the preimages and then explaining the topological argument to find the linking number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field using topological methods.\n    The method involves finding the preimages of two points on S^2 and determining their linking number.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the problem and choose two points on the sphere S^2.\")\n    print(\"The vector field n(x,y,z) is defined by functions G and f.\")\n    print(\"f = atan2(y, x)\")\n    print(\"G = PI * exp(-10 * r2), where r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z)\")\n    print(\"The Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of two points.\")\n    print(\"We choose the South Pole, p_S = (0, 0, -1), and an equatorial point, p_E = (1, 0, 0).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Preimage of the South Pole ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the preimage of the South Pole, p_S = (0, 0, -1).\")\n    print(\"The condition n = p_S means nz = cos(G) = -1.\")\n    print(\"This implies G = (2k+1)*pi for an integer k.\")\n    print(\"The function G has range (0, pi], so we must have G = pi.\")\n    \n    # Solve G = pi\n    # pi = pi * exp(-10 * r2)\n    # 1 = exp(-10 * r2)\n    # This implies -10 * r2 = 0, so r2 = 0.\n    print(\"Solving G = pi gives r2 = 0.\")\n    \n    # Solve r2 = 0\n    # 0 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z)\n    # This means z=0 and (x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 = 0\n    # which simplifies to z=0 and x*x+y*y=0.5\n    z_s = 0.0\n    rho2_s = 0.5\n    print(f\"Solving r2 = 0 gives two conditions:\")\n    print(f\"1. z = {z_s}\")\n    print(f\"2. x^2 + y^2 = {rho2_s}\")\n    print(\"This is the equation of a circle in the xy-plane with radius sqrt(0.5).
