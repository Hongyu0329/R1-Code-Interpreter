# The original Diophantine equation can be factored algebraically into the product of two expressions:
# (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) * (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) = 0
# This means we must solve either x^3 + y^3 = z^3 or x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4.

# Case 1: x^3 + y^3 = z^3
# According to Fermat's Last Theorem, this equation has no solutions for positive integers x, y, and z.

# Case 2: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4
# This equation does have solutions. It is a counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture.
# The problem asks for the solution (x, y, z, w) with the smallest maximum value.
# The smallest known positive integer solution was found by Roger Frye in 1988.

# Assign the values of this smallest solution. The assignment of x, y, z is interchangeable.
x = 95800
y = 217519
z = 414560
w = 422481

# The required sum is x + y + z.
sum_xyz = x + y + z
