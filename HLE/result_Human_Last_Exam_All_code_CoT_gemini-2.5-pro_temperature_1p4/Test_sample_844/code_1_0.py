# The task is to identify the false statement from a list of options based on a given text.
# The analysis concludes that option D provides an unsupported reason for a biological phenomenon.

# The reasoning is as follows:
# 1. The activity of the enzyme galactosidase is primarily regulated by the presence of its substrate, raffinose.
# 2. When the CA biotype is moved from watermelon (inferred to be high in raffinose) to cotton
#    (inferred to be low in raffinose), the galactosidase activity is expected to decrease.
# 3. Option C correctly attributes this decrease to "lower raffinose levels in cotton."
# 4. Option D attributes this same decrease to "higher glucose levels in cotton."
# 5. The text does not provide information about glucose levels, and the most direct regulatory
#    mechanism involves the substrate (raffinose), not glucose.
# 6. Therefore, the reason given in option D is not supported by the text and is less
#    biologically direct than the reason in C, making statement D the incorrect one.

# Define the incorrect statement
incorrect_statement = "D"

# Print the final answer
print(f"The statement that is not true is: {incorrect_statement}")
