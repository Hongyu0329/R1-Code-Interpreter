# Define the given parameters for the knowledge graph FAIRness audit
c = 0.85  # Confidence of the pattern in the subgraph G
s = 0.12  # Support of the pattern in the subgraph G
c_prime = 0.78  # Confidence of the anti-correlated pattern in the 2-hop neighborhood
beta = 0.23  # Bottleneck coefficient of the knowledge graph

# This model calculates the evidence ratio (E_r) as a signal-to-noise ratio.
# The "signal" is the local confidence (c).
# The "noise" is the combination of the external counter-evidence (c_prime)
# filtered by the bottleneck (beta), and the internal uncertainty due to
# incomplete support (1 - s).

# Numerator: Evidence for the violation (Signal)
numerator = c

# Denominator: Evidence for the pattern being a statistical artifact (Noise)
denominator = c_prime * beta * (1 - s)

# Calculate the minimum ratio of evidence (E_r)
E_r = numerator / denominator

# Output the equation and the final result
# The problem requires outputting each number in the final equation.
