    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of self-avoiding walks of length 10 on a 2D square (Manhattan) lattice. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a grid that starts at the origin and does not visit the same point more than once.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate this number, denoted as `a(10)`:\n1.  We will implement a recursive, depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible walks.\n2.  The walk starts at the origin `(0, 0)`.\n3.  At each step of the walk, we explore the four possible moves: up, down, left, and right.\n4.  To ensure the walk is \"self-avoiding,\" we keep track of all visited points in the current path. A move is valid only if it leads to a point that has not been previously visited. A `set` is an efficient data structure for this purpose.\n5.  The recursion continues until the path reaches the desired length of 10 steps. When a valid 10-step walk is found, a counter is incremented.\n6.  The algorithm uses backtracking: after exploring a path from a point, that point is removed from the current path set, allowing other paths to be explored from the previous point.\n7.  The final count is the value of `a(10)`. The script will print this result in the format `a(10) = [result]`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_self_avoiding_walks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice\n    using a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The desired length of the walk.\n    n = 10\n    \n    # A counter for the number of valid walks found.\n    # We use a list to make it mutable inside the nested function.\n    walk_count = [0]\n\n    def explore(current_pos, path, length):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively explores paths from the current position.\n\n        Args:\n            current_pos (tuple): The (x, y) coordinates of the current step.\n            path (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n            length (int): The current length of the walk.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If the walk has reached the desired length, increment the counter.\n        if length == n:\n            walk_count[0] += 1\n            return\n\n        x, y = current_pos\n        \n        # Define the four possible moves: North, East, South, West.\n        moves = [(x, y + 1), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x - 1, y)]\n\n        # Explore each possible move.\n        for next_pos in moves:\n            # A move is valid if the next position has not been visited.\n            if next_pos not in path:\n                # Add the new position to the path and recurse.\n                path.add(next_pos)\n                explore(next_pos, path, length + 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the position to explore other branches.\n                path.remove(next_pos)\n\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_position = (0, 0)\n    \n    # The initial path contains only the starting point.\n    initial_path = {start_position}\n\n    # Start the recursive exploration.\n    explore(start_position, initial_path, 0)\n    \n    # The final result is the first element of our counter list.\n    result = walk_count[0]\n    \n    # Print the result, including the numbers from the equation a(n) = result.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_self_avoiding_walks()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
