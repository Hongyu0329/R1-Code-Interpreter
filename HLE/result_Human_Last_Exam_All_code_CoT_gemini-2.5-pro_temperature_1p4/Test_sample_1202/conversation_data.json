    "The question asks to identify the primary mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. To solve this, I will first define each of the potential mechanisms provided as answer choices. Then, I will analyze which of these mechanisms best explains a scenario where a duplicated gene is not only kept within the genome but also evolves to be different from its original copy. My analysis will focus on how each process affects both retention and divergence. The final conclusion will be presented by a Python script that programmatically defines and evaluates the options to arrive at the most suitable answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the possible fates of duplicated genes to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    # A dictionary mapping answer choices to their definitions and analysis.\n    options = {\n        'A': {\n            'term': 'Gene conversion',\n            'explanation': 'A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence.
