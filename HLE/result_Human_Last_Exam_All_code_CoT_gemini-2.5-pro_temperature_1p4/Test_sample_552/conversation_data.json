    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n1. First, I will identify Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n2. Next, I will use my knowledge base to search for the citations and footnotes within that paper, specifically looking for any mention of \"lectures\".\n3. Finally, I will write a Python script to store the identified individual's name in a variable and then print the complete answer to your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the lecturer\n    cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    lecturer_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    paper_topic = \"Brownian motion\"\n    year = 1905\n\n    print(f\"In his {year} paper on {paper_topic}, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of {lecturer_name} on gas theory.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nfind_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
