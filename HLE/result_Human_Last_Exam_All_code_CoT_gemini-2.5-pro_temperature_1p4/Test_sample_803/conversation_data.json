    "Of course, I can help with that. This question delves into a specific topic in modern group theory. To find the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, we need to rely on the latest classification theorems for such groups.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Define \"Filled Group\"**: A finite group `G` is called \"filled\" if for every maximal product-free set `S` in `G`, the equality `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}` holds, where `e` is the identity element. This property is not trivial to check.\n2.  **Use a Classification Theorem**: Fortunately, a recent paper, \"A classification of finite filled groups\" by Elsholtz, Lev, and Shkredov (2022), provides a complete list of finite filled groups. According to the theorem, a finite group is filled if and only if it is:\n    *   Abelian, OR\n    *   Isomorphic to one of three specific nonabelian groups: `D₁₀` (the dihedral group of order 10), `C₄ ⋊ C₄`, or `(C₄ × C₂) ⋊ C₂`.\n3.  **Filter the Groups**: Since the question asks for *nonabelian* groups, we only need to consider the three nonabelian groups from the theorem.\n4.  **Check the Order Condition**: For each of these three groups, I will check if its order can be expressed in the form `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that carries out this plan. The script will:\n    *   Store the list of known nonabelian filled groups and their orders.\n    *   Implement a function to test if an order `n` matches the form `2q^m`.\n    *   Iterate through the groups, apply the test, and print the results of the analysis.\n    *   Conclude with the final answer.\n\nThis approach uses established mathematical results to answer the question and presents the reasoning in a clear, executable Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_nonabelian_filled_groups_of_specific_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds which of the known nonabelian filled groups have an order of the form\n    2 * q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number (m >= 1).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Use the known classification of nonabelian filled groups.\n    # Based on the paper \"A classification of finite filled groups\" (Elsholtz, Lev, Shkredov, 2022),\n    # there are only three such groups.\n    nonabelian_filled_groups = {\n        \"D_10\": {\"order\": 10},               # Dihedral group of order 10\n        \"C4_rtimes_C4\": {\"order\": 16},       # A semidirect product of C4 by C4\n        \"(C4_x_C2)_rtimes_C2\": {\"order\": 16} # A semidirect product of (C4 x C2) by C2\n    }\n\n    print(\"Identifying nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m (q is an odd prime, m >= 1).\\n\")\n    print(\"According to current classification theorems, there are only three nonabelian filled groups.\")\n    print(\"We will check the order of each one.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Define a helper function to check the order condition.\n    def check_order_form(n):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if an integer n can be expressed as 2 * q^m.\n        Returns a tuple (q, m) if it matches, otherwise returns None.\n        \"\"\"\n        if n % 2 != 0 or n <= 2:\n            return None\n        \n        k = n // 2  # k must be q^m\n\n        if k == 1:  # m must be >= 1\n            return None\n\n        # Find all unique prime factors of k\n        temp_k = k\n        prime_factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= temp_k:\n            if temp_k % d == 0:\n                prime_factors.add(d)\n                while temp_k % d == 0:\n                    temp_k //= d\n            d += 1\n        if temp_k > 1:\n            prime_factors.add(temp_k)\n\n        # If k is a power of a prime, it will have only one prime factor.\n        if len(prime_factors) != 1:\n            return None\n\n        q = prime_factors.pop()\n\n        # The prime q must be odd.\n        if q % 2 == 0:\n            return None\n\n        # Calculate m\n        m = round(math.log(k, q))\n        \n        # Double check if k is a perfect power of q\n        if q**m == k and m >= 1:\n            return q, m\n        else:\n            return None\n\n    # Step 3: Iterate through the groups and check them.\n    found_groups = []\n    for name, properties in nonabelian_filled_groups.items():\n        order = properties[\"order\"]\n        print(f\"--- Checking Group: {name}, Order: {order} ---\")\n        \n        result = check_order_form(order)\n        \n        if result:\n            q, m = result\n            print(f\"SUCCESS: The order {order} matches the form 2 * q^m.\")\n            # Final equation output as requested\n            print(f\"The equation is: {order} = 2 * {q}^{m}\")\n            found_groups.append(name)\n        else:\n            print(f\"FAIL: The order {order} cannot be written as 2 * q^m for an odd prime q.\")\n        print(\"-\" * (26 + len(name)))\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final conclusion.\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    if found_groups:\n        print(\"The following nonabelian filled group(s) have an order of the specified form:\")\n        for group_name in found_groups:\n            print(f\"  - {group_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No nonabelian filled groups match the specified order form.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_nonabelian_filled_groups_of_specific_order()\n```\n<<<D_10>>>"
