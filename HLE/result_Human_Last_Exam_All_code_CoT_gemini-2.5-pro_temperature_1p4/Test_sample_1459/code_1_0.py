# The problem is to find the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces:
# 1. The interval X = [0, 1] with the standard absolute value metric.
# 2. The unit circle Y = S^1 with the intrinsic metric (shortest arc length).

# The interval [0, 1] has a diameter of 1.
interval_diameter = 1.0

# The unit circle has a radius of 1. Its circumference is 2 * pi.
# The intrinsic metric means the distance between two points is the shortest arc length.
# The maximum distance on the unit circle is between antipodal points, which is pi.
pi = math.pi
circle_diameter = pi

# The Gromov-Hausdorff distance d_GH(X, Y) for this specific case is known to be pi / 2.
# This can be proven by finding matching upper and lower bounds for the distance.
#
# Upper bound: A "folding" correspondence can be constructed that maps the circle
# to the interval. The distortion of this correspondence is exactly pi.
# Since d_GH(X, Y) = (1/2) * inf(distortion), this gives d_GH(X, Y) <= pi / 2.
#
# Lower bound: A topological argument shows that for ANY correspondence between
# the two spaces, there must exist a point in the interval that is related to
# two antipodal points on the circle. For these points, the distortion is at
# least pi. This implies that for any correspondence, the distortion is >= pi.
# Therefore, d_GH(X, Y) >= pi / 2.
#
# Since the distance is both <= pi/2 and >= pi/2, it must be exactly pi/2.

# The final equation for the distance is pi / 2.
