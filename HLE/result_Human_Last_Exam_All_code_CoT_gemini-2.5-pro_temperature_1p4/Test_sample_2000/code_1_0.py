    # The reasoning is laid out in the text explanation above.
    # This code serves to programmatically state the conclusion based on that logic.

    # 1. An upper bound is established. For any hypergraph H with 3 edges {e1, e2, e3},
    #    a width-2 generalized hypertree decomposition can be constructed.
    #    This proves that max_H ghtw(H) <= 2.

    # 2. A lower bound is established. There exists a specific hypergraph H_0
    #    (the 3-edge cyclic hypergraph) for which ghtw(H_0) > 1, meaning ghtw(H_0) >= 2.
    #    This proves that max_H ghtw(H) >= 2.
    lower_bound = 2

    # 3. Combining the upper and lower bounds gives the exact maximum value.
    max_ghtw = min(upper_bound, lower_bound) # Or max, since they are equal.

    print("It can be proven that this hypergraph cannot have a ghtw of 1.")
    print(f"Therefore, its ghtw must be at least {lower_bound}. This means the maximum ghtw must be at least {lower_bound}.")
