    "To solve this, we need to understand the crystallographic requirements for a material to be achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n*   **Chirality**: A crystal is chiral if its structure is not superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs in crystal classes that lack a center of inversion (`-1` or `i`) and mirror planes (`m`). In total, there are 11 chiral crystal classes.\n*   **Polarity**: A crystal is polar if it has a unique directional axis, meaning a direction `[uvw]` is not symmetrically equivalent to `[-u-v-w]`. There are 10 polar crystal classes. A crystal class that is not polar is non-polar.\n*   **Optical Activity**: This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. While it is commonly taught that only chiral materials are optically active, the true condition is that the crystal's symmetry must allow for non-zero components in its gyration tensor. This includes all 11 chiral classes, but also, crucially, several **achiral** classes.\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **optically active**. We can write a Python script to check which of the classes listed in the answer choices meet all three criteria.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define a list of the crystal classes from the answer choices.\n2.  For each class, store its properties: whether it's chiral, whether it's polar, and whether it's optically active (based on the full symmetry rules, not the simplified \"chiral-only\" rule).\n3.  Filter this list to find the classes that are `achiral` (not chiral), `non-polar` (not polar), AND `optically active`.\n4.  Print the results.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystal classes to find those that are achiral, non-polar,\n    and optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432\n    chiral_classes = {'1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'}\n\n    # The 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', 'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'}\n\n    # Classes that allow optical activity (non-zero gyration tensor).\n    # This includes all chiral classes plus some specific achiral ones.\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432', # Chiral\n        'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm', '-4', '-42m', '-6', '-6m2' # Achiral exceptions\n    }\n\n    # Data for all classes mentioned in the answer choices.\n    # Note: '-62m' is the same class as '-6m2'.
