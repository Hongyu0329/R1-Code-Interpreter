    # --- Explanation for Question (a) ---
    # Question: Does the existence of a non-zero sigma(a) for all a in Q1
    # imply that g acts by a reflection?

    # Answer: No.
    # The definition of a quiver-Taft map relates a map sigma to a given
    # quiver automorphism g. The properties of sigma depend on g, but not
    # necessarily vice-versa. We can construct a counterexample where sigma
    # is non-zero but g is not a reflection.
    
    # Counterexample Construction:
    # - Quiver Q: Vertices Q0 = {0, 1}, Arrow Q1 = {a: 0 -> 1}. Let n=2.
    # - Automorphism g: Let g be the identity map (g(v)=v, g(a)=a). The
    #   identity map is not a reflection of the form g.e_i = e_{n-d-i}
    #   (which for n=2, d=1 would be e_{1-i}, swapping 0 and 1).
    # - Map sigma: Let lambda=1. Define sigma(v)=0 for vertices v, and
    #   sigma(a) = a.
    
    # Verification of conditions:
    # 1. sigma(kQ0) = 0: Holds by definition.
    # 2. sigma(a) = e_{s(a)} sigma(a) e_{t(a)}: This is a = e_0 * a * e_1, which is true.
    # 3. sigma(g . a) = lambda^{-1} g . sigma(a): This becomes sigma(a) = 1 * sigma(a),
    #    which is true.
    
    # Conclusion: We have a non-zero sigma(a), but g is not a reflection.
    # The implication is false.
    
    print("Answer to (a): No.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Explanation for Question (b) ---
    # Question: Provide a condition on d for which sigma(a) != 0 must hold
    # for all a in Q1.

    # This requires a condition on d that forces any non-trivial sigma map to be
    # non-zero on every arrow. The reasoning relies on analyzing the fixed points
    # of the automorphism g.
    
    # A vertex i is a fixed point of g if i = n-d-i, which means 2i = n-d.
    # This implies that g can only have a fixed vertex if n-d is an even number.
    # If n-d is odd, g has no fixed vertices, and thus no fixed arrows.
    
    # Case 1: n-d is even.
    # If n-d is even, let k = (n-d)/2. Vertex k is a fixed point of g.
    # If the quiver has a loop 'c' at k, then g.c = c.
    # The defining relation for sigma on 'c' is sigma(c) = lambda^{-1} g.sigma(c).
    # If g acts trivially on the element sigma(c), this becomes
    # sigma(c) = lambda^{-1} sigma(c).
    # If lambda = -1 (a common choice in related algebraic structures),
    # this implies sigma(c) = -sigma(c), which means 2*sigma(c) = 0.
    # In a field of characteristic not 2, this forces sigma(c) = 0.
    # However, sigma could be non-zero on other arrows that are not fixed points.
    # Therefore, if n-d is even, it is possible for sigma(a) to be zero for some 'a'
    # even if sigma is non-trivial overall. So this cannot be the condition.

    # Case 2: n-d is odd.
    # By elimination, the condition is that n-d is odd. When n-d is odd, there are
    # no fixed points for the action of g on the quiver. This structural property
    # removes the possibility of the counterexample described above. While not a
    # complete proof without more context on the map sigma, it is the only
    # condition derivable from the provided definitions that depends only on d.
    
    print("Answer to (b): A condition on d is that the number n-d must be odd.")
