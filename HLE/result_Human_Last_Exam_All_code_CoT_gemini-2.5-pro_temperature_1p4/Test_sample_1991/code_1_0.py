# Plan:
# 1. The target phrase needs to be 14 syllables, matching the song title "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".
# 2. The topic is abnormal cell death (cancer) in the Luys' body (the subthalamic nucleus).
# 3. The phrase must have each word capitalized and contain no hyphens.
# 4. The final phrase will be printed to the console.

# Let's break down the chosen phrase: "Subthalamic Nucleus Gives Us Growth Atrocious"
# Syllable Count:
# Sub(1) + tha(1) + la(1) + mic(1) = 4
# Nu(1) + cle(1) + us(1) = 3
# Gives(1) + Us(1) = 2
# Growth(1) = 1
# A(1) + tro(1) + cious(2) = 4
# Total syllables = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 14. This is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate.

# Syllable Count Re-evaluation:
# Sub-tha-la-mic (4) Nu-cle-us (3) Gives (1) Us (1) Growth (1) A-tro-cious (3) = 13. Incorrect.
# Let's try again.
# "Subthalamic" is 4 syllables (Sub-tha-lam-ic).
# "Nucleus" is 3 syllables (Nu-cle-us).
# "Gives" is 1 syllable.
# "Us" is 1 syllable.
# "Growth" is 1 syllable.
# "Atrocious" is 3 syllables (A-tro-cious).
# 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 13. Still not right.

# Let's find a new phrase. How about:
# "The Subthalamic Neoplastic Growth Atrocious"
# Syllable Count:
# The(1) + Sub-tha-lam-ic(4) + Ne-o-plas-tic(4) + Growth(1) + A-tro-cious(3) = 13. Still wrong.
# Let's re-check the syllables online. "Neoplastic" is 4. "Subthalamic" is 4. "Atrocious" is 3. Yes, 1+4+4+1+3=13.

# Let's try one more time. The key must be getting the syllables right.
# My previous analysis for "Subthalamic Nucleus Gives Us Growth Atrocious" was:
# Sub(1) tha(1) la(1) mic(1) Nu(1) cle(1) us(1) Gives(1) Us(1) Growth(1) A(1) tro(1) cious(2) = 14.
# A common pronunciation of "atrocious" is a-tro-shus (2 syllables), but it can be 3 (a-tro-ci-ous).
# Let's assume a 3-syllable pronunciation for "atrocious" and 2 for "nucleus".
# Sub(1) tha(1) lam(1) ic(1) Nu(1) cleus(1) Gives(1) Us(1) Growth(1) A(1) tro(1) cious(2) -> 12. No.

# Okay, new approach. Let's lock in the end. "Growth Is Quite Atrocious" -> 5 syllables.
# I need 9 syllables before that about the Luys' body.
# "Subthalamic Cells Apoptosis Is Slowing" -> Sub(4) + cells(1) + ap(1) op(1) to(1) sis(1) + is(1) + slow(1) ing(1) = 12.
# This is surprisingly difficult.

# Let's return to the most promising candidate, but be very precise with syllables.
# Song: Su-per-ca-li-fra-gil-is-tic-ex-pi-a-li-do-cious (14 syllables)
# My proposed phrase: "Abnormal Cell Mitosis In Luys Proves Atrocious"
# Let's count:
# Ab-nor-mal (3)
# Cell (1)
# Mi-to-sis (3)
# In (1)
# Luys (1)
# Proves (1)
# A-tro-cious (3)
# 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 13. Still one short.

# What if "Luys" is two syllables? "Lu-ys"? That feels like a stretch.
# Let's add a word. "Abnormal Cell Mitosis In The Luys Proves Atrocious"
# 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 14! Perfect.
# Topic: "Abnormal Cell Mitosis" (cancer), "In The Luys" (Luys' body). Correct.
# Scansion: Ab-NOR-mal CELL mi-TO-sis IN the LUYS proves a-TRO-cious. The rhythm has a nice flow.
# Formatting: Capitalized, no hyphens.
# This is the one.
