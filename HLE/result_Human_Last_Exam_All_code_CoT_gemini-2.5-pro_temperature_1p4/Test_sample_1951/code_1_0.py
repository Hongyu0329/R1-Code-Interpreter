    This function identifies the incorrect statements about State Enumeration Graphs (SEGs) and Logical Attack Graphs (LAGs).

    Based on the analysis:
    - Statement A is incorrect because the generation of a Logical Attack Graph (LAG) data structure is typically a polynomial-time operation, although its analysis can be exponential. The statement claims it's exponential for both SEG and LAG.
    - Statement D is incorrect because it makes a strong claim of impossibility ("cannot"). While difficult, methods do exist to calculate probabilities in graphs with cycles (e.g., using Markov chains for SEGs or dynamic Bayesian networks for LAGs).
    - Statements B, C, and E are correct descriptions of the properties and differences of SEGs and LAGs.

    The incorrect statements are A and D. They are printed in alphabetical order, separated by a comma.
