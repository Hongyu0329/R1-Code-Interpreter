    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Count the atoms:** Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom type for 6-31G:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** As a first-row atom, its valence `1s` orbital is described by two basis functions: one inner function (a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians) and one outer function (a single primitive Gaussian). So, each H atom uses **2** contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** As a second-row atom, the basis set is defined as:\n        *   **Core (1s orbital):** Represented by a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussians. (1 function)\n        *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The basis is split. There's one set of functions for the inner part (contracted from 3 primitives) and another for the outer part (1 primitive). This applies to both the s and p orbitals.\n            *   Inner part: 1 s-function + 3 p-functions = 4 functions.\n            *   Outer part: 1 s-function + 3 p-functions = 4 functions.\n        *   Total functions per C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** contracted Gaussian functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each atom by its respective number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Toluene (C7H8) atom counts\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# For the 6-31G basis set, the number of contracted Gaussian functions (basis functions) per atom is:\n# - For Carbon (a second-row element): 9\n# - For Hydrogen (a first-row element): 2\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions\ntotal_functions = (num_carbon * functions_per_carbon) + (num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen)\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final calculation\nprint(\"The total number of contracted Gaussian functions for Toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set is calculated by:\")\nprint(f\"Summing the functions from {num_carbon} Carbon atoms and {num_hydrogen} Hydrogen atoms.\")\nprint(f\"\\n- Functions from Carbon: {num_carbon} atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/atom\")\nprint(f\"- Functions from Hydrogen: {num_hydrogen} atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/atom\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon} + {num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
