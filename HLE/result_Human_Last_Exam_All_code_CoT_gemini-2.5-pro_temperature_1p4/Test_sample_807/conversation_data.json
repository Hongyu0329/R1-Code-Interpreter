    "To identify the Crayola crayon color, we first need to determine the common name of the chemical provided. The chemical \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\" is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. This substance is a fluorescent dye known for its brilliant reddish-pink or magenta color. By researching the pigments used by Crayola, we can find that Rhodamine B is a key ingredient in the crayon color \"Cerise\".\n\nThe following Python code will store this information and print the answer for you.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the Crayola crayon color containing a specific chemical.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided in the query\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    # The common name for this chemical compound\n    common_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n\n    # The Crayola crayon color that contains this pigment\n    crayon_color = \"Cerise\"\n\n    print(f\"The chemical compound known as {chemical_name} is a dye.\")\n    print(f\"Its common name is {common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This pigment gives the Crayola crayon color '{crayon_color}' its vibrant hue.\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Cerise>>>"
