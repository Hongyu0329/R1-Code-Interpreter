    "Based on the scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022), the lacrimal recess contains two depressions. The paper \"Irritator challengeri, a new spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues et al. (2002) states: \"The lacrimal recess is subdivided by a low, rounded ridge into two depressions.\"\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this answer.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri\n# is a fact derived from paleontological studies of its fossil.\n# According to the primary scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002), this number is 2.\n\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# We present the result as a simple statement.\nprint(\"Number of depressions = \" + str(number_of_depressions))\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
