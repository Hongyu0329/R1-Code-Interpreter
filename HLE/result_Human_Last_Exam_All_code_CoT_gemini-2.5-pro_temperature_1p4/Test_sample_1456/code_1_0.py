    explanation = """
To solve this, we rely on definitions and a key theorem from continuum theory.

1.  A 'continuum' is a compact, connected metric space. A 'nondegenerate'
    continuum is a continuum that consists of more than one point.

2.  A 'composant' of a point p in a continuum X is the set of all points q
    in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both p and q.
    (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum not equal to the whole space).

3.  The number of composants in a continuum is related to whether it is
    'decomposable' or 'indecomposable'.
    - A 'decomposable' continuum can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.
    - An 'indecomposable' continuum cannot.

4.  The number of composants for any continuum is either:
    - 1, if the continuum is decomposable.
    - Uncountably infinite (c), if the continuum is indecomposable.

5.  The question is about the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y.
    The product space Z = X x Y is also a continuum.

6.  A fundamental theorem by J. Krasinkiewicz (1974) states that the product
    of any two nondegenerate continua is always decomposable.

7.  Since Z = X x Y is always decomposable, it follows that it must have
    exactly one composant. This is true even if X and Y themselves are
    indecomposable.
