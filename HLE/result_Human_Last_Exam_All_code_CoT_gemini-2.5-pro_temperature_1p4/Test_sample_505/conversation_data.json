    "To solve this, we need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a surface code.\n\nFor a single, simple planar patch of surface code (which has a genus of 0), the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes (or inner boundaries) created within it.\n\n1.  **Logical qubits per patch:** The problem states each patch has two holes. Therefore, a single patch can encode `k_patch = 2` logical qubits.\n2.  **Total logical qubits:** We have two such patches. Since these patches are separate and independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nTotal logical qubits = (qubits in patch 1) + (qubits in patch 2).\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this result.\n\n```python\n# Number of separate surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes in each patch\nholes_per_patch = 2\n\n# For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes.\nqubits_per_patch = holes_per_patch\n\n# Since the patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\n# Print the final equation\n# We will show the addition of qubits from each patch.\npatch_contributions = [str(qubits_per_patch) for _ in range(num_patches)]\nequation_str = \" + \".join(patch_contributions)\nprint(f\"The total number of logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each patch:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
