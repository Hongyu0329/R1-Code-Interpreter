    print("In a grid graph, the shortest cycle has length 4. Any cycle longer than 4 must have a 'chord' (a shortcut edge between non-adjacent cycle vertices), meaning it is not induced.")
    print("For example, in a 5x5 grid, the cycle [(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,0), (0,0)] has length 6. But the vertices (0,1) and (1,1) are adjacent to other vertices in the cycle they are not consecutive with (e.g., (1,1) is adjacent to (1,0) if it is in the cycle, which would form a chord), or more simply, any large loop on a grid has grid points inside it, which connect to the loop vertices and form chords.")
    print("Thus, the longest induced cycle in any grid graph is of length 4.")

    print("In a large enough grid, these edges form a matching. The endpoints of one edge, (0, 4i) and (1, 4i), are far from the endpoints of another, (0, 4j) and (1, 4j), so no extra edges exist between them. This matching is induced.")
    print("We can construct an arbitrarily large induced matching this way in a large enough grid.")

    print("A fundamental result in graph theory (a consequence of Kuratowski's theorem) is that planar graphs cannot have K_5 as a minor.")
