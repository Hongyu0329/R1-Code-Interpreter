    This function calculates and prints the minimal resources needed to simulate

    The simulation of a singlet state's correlations cannot be done with LHV alone
    (due to Bell's Theorem). However, it can be done perfectly if the LHV model
    is augmented with a small amount of classical communication.

    The key result by Toner and Bacon (2003) provides the exact resources needed.

    #    PR-Box. The simulation can be achieved with communication alone.
    #    Therefore, zero PR-boxes are needed.

    # 3. Shared Randomness (The "Hidden Variable"): The model requires the two
    #    parties to share a continuous random variable (a random unit vector),
