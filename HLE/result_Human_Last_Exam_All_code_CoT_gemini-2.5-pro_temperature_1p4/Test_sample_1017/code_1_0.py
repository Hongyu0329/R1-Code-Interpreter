# Step 1 & 2: Interpretation of the problem.
# The group G is a version of Thompson's group F acting on the circle R/Z.
# Elements of G must have dyadic rational rotation numbers.
# The elements g (translation by 2/27) and h (translation by 16/27) do not belong to G
# because their rotation numbers are not dyadic.
# The problem is interpreted as computing the scl in a larger group containing G, g, and h,
# specifically in the free product of two copies of this larger group.
# The element is g_1 * h_2, where g_1 corresponds to g and h_2 corresponds to h.

# Step 3: Determine the orders of the elements g and h as homeomorphisms of the circle S^1 = R/Z.
# An element f(x) = x + c has order p if p is the smallest positive integer such that p*c is an integer.
# For g, c = 2/27. The order p is 27.
p = 27
# For h, c = 16/27. The order q is 27.
q = 27

# Step 4: Apply the formula for scl of a product of torsion elements in a free product.
# The formula is scl(ab) = (1/2) * (1 - 1/p) * (1 - 1/q).

# Step 5: Calculate the final value.
p_minus_1 = p - 1
q_minus_1 = q - 1

# Numerator of the final fraction (before simplification)
numerator = p_minus_1 * q_minus_1

# Denominator of the final fraction (before simplification)
denominator = 2 * p * q

# Use the fractions module to get the simplified fraction
final_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
final_numerator = final_fraction.numerator
final_denominator = final_fraction.denominator

# Step 6: Print the calculation and the final equation.
print(f"The calculation is based on the formula for the stable commutator length of a product of two torsion elements in a free product: scl(ab) = (1/2) * (1 - 1/p) * (1 - 1/q).")
print(f"The element g corresponds to translation by 2/27, which has order p = {p} on the circle S^1.")
print(f"The element h corresponds to translation by 16/27, which has order q = {q} on the circle S^1.")
print(f"Substituting these values into the formula gives:")
print(f"(1/2) * (1 - 1/{p}) * (1 - 1/{q}) = (1/2) * ({p_minus_1}/{p}) * ({q_minus_1}/{q}) = {numerator}/{denominator} = {final_numerator}/{final_denominator}")

# We present it as a string to show the final fraction form.
