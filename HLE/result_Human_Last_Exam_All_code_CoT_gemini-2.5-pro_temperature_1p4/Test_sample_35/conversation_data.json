    "This is a classic poker problem that involves balancing aggression with risk, especially near the money bubble. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to shove.\n\n**1. Analyze the Situation**\n*   **Stack Size (16bb):** This stack is in the \"push/fold\" zone. It's generally too small to raise and then fold to a 3-bet, so our primary options are to either go all-in or fold.\n*   **Position (UTG+1):** This is an early position. Since many players act after us, we must be selective with the hands we play. Shoving from here requires a stronger range than shoving from a later position.\n*   **The Money Bubble:** This is the most crucial factor. Players will tighten up significantly to avoid being eliminated before making the money. This means our all-in shoves have a higher chance of succeeding (high fold equity). However, it also means that if we are called, our opponent will have a very strong hand. Therefore, our shoving range should consist of hands that have good equity against a strong calling range and hands with good \"blocker\" effects (like an Ace or King, which make it less likely for opponents to hold AA, KK, AK).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Hand Options**\nBased on standard push/fold charts for a 16bb stack from an early position, we can create a baseline shoving range. A typical range would be something like `77+, ATs+, KQs, AQo+`.\n\n*   **A. QJs:** This hand is too weak to shove from UTG+1. It's often dominated if called. **(Incorrect)**\n*   **D. AJo:** While it has a good blocker, it's also dominated by the hands that will call a 16bb shove from early position (like AQ, AK, JJ+). It's a fold. **(Incorrect)**\n*   **C. 99:** This is a strong pair and falls within the standard `77+` shoving range. It's a profitable all-in. **(Correct)**\n*   **E. AKo:** This is a premium hand. It dominates almost all other Ax hands and has excellent equity even when called by pocket pairs. It is at the top of the `AQo+` range. It's an easy all-in. **(Correct)**\n\n**3. Choose the Best Answer**\nBoth `99` and `AKo` are correct hands to shove in this situation. However, `AKo` is a more robust shove for a few reasons. It has better equity against a typical bubble calling range (e.g., TT+, AQ+), and its high cards act as powerful blockers, reducing the chances of running into AA or KK. Given it's one of the strongest possible starting hands, `AKo` is the most unequivocally correct and best hand to jam among the choices.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically analyze the options based on a standard shoving range and determine the best course of action.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_hand_rank(hand):\n    \"\"\"Assigns a rank to a hand for comparison.
