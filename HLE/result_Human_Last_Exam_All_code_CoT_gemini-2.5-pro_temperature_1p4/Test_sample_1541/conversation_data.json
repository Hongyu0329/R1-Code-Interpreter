    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem and the accompanying code.\n\n### Plan\n\n**1. Solving the Xenia Sum Problem (Python)**\n\nThe task is to reorder the numbers in a given sum (like \"3+2+1\") so that they are in non-decreasing order (like \"1+2+3\"). The most straightforward way to solve this in Python is:\n1.  Read the entire input line, which is a string like \"1+3+2+1\".\n2.  Use the `split('+')` method to separate the string into a list of number strings: `['1', '3', '2', '1']`.\n3.  Sort this list. Since the elements are single-digit strings, a standard lexicographical sort works perfectly: `['1', '1', '2', '3']`.\n4.  Join the sorted list of strings back together using `'+'` as the separator to form the final string: `\"1+1+2+3\"`.\n5.  Print the resulting string.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Most Memory-Efficient C Program**\n\nThe user also asked to determine the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program for this task. To minimize memory, the program should avoid storing the entire input string (which can be up to 1000 characters). The best approach is:\n\n1.  **Read character by character:** Use the `getchar()` function in a loop to read the input one character at a time, without storing the whole string in an array.\n2.  **Count the numbers:** Use a small integer array, let's call it `counts`, of size 4 to store the frequencies of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'. As we read each character, if it's a digit, we increment the corresponding counter.\n3.  **Print the sorted sum:** After counting is done, iterate from 1 to 4. For each number, print it as many times as it was counted, separated by '+' signs.\n\n**Memory Calculation:**\n\nBased on this C program design, the variables required and their memory consumption (assuming a standard system where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes) would be:\n*   `int counts[4]`: An array to store the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4). Memory: `4 * sizeof(int)` = `4 * 4` = 16 bytes.\n*   `int c`: A variable to hold the character returned by `getchar()`. It's an `int` to handle the `EOF` value. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `int i`: A loop variable for iterating through the `counts` array during printing. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `int first_term`: A flag (e.g., 1 for true, 0 for false) to correctly handle printing the '+' separator only between numbers. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 16 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **28 bytes**.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem as described.\n\n```python\ndef solve_xenia_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), sorts the numbers,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string, e.g., \"3+2+1\"\n    s = input()\n\n    # Split the string by the '+' delimiter to get a list of number strings\n    # e.g., \"3+2+1\" becomes ['3', '2', '1']\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single digits,\n    # lexicographical sorting is equivalent to numerical sorting.\n    # e.g., ['3', '2', '1'] becomes ['1', '2', '3']\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted list back into a single string with '+'\n    # e.g., ['1', '2', '3'] becomes \"1+2+3\"\n    sorted_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n\n    # Print the final rearranged sum\n    print(sorted_sum)\n\nsolve_xenia_sum()\n```\n<<<28>>>"
