    print("4. We interpret the '1-skeleton of P, as a directed graph' by using the natural order of R. An edge is directed from x to y if x < y. This creates a directed graph G_dir, which is the transitive tournament on R.")
    print("5. X is the line graph of G_dir. A clique in a directed graph is typically a clique in its underlying undirected graph.")
    print("   - The vertices of X are the directed edges of G_dir, i.e., pairs (x, y) where x, y are in R and x < y.")
    print("   - An edge exists between two vertices v1 = (x1, y1) and v2 = (x2, y2) in X if the end of one is the start of the other. This means an edge exists if y1 = x2 or y2 = x1.\n")

    print("We can prove that a clique cannot contain two vertices with the same starting point (e.g., (a,b) and (a,c)).")
    print("   - If v_i=(a,b) and v_j=(a,c) are in a clique, they must be connected.")
    print("   - Connection requires y_i=x_j or y_j=x_i, which means b=a or c=a.")
    print("   - This contradicts the vertex condition x < y (i.e., a < b and a < c).")
    print("   - Therefore, all x_i in a clique must be distinct. Similarly, all y_i must be distinct.\n")
    print("Back to v3's connection to v1: since y1=x2 and all x_i must be distinct, y1 cannot be x3 (as x3 would equal x2).")
