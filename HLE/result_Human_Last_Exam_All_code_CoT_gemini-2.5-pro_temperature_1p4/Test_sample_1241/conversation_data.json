    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system, which are the values of $P_i(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nIn the steady state, the probabilities are constant, which means their derivatives with respect to time are zero. So, we set $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. This converts the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nThe resulting system of linear equations is:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\nAnd the normalization condition must always hold:\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\nNotice that if you sum the first, third, and fourth equations, you get the negative of the second equation. This means one of the first four equations is redundant. We can form a solvable system by taking three of these equations and the normalization condition.\n\nI will use Python with the NumPy library to solve this system of linear equations for $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ and then calculate the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\nThe script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the given rate constants $\\lambda_{ij}$.\n2.  Set up the coefficient matrix `A` and the constant vector `b` corresponding to the system of linear equations.\n3.  Solve the system $A\\pi = b$ to find the vector of steady-state probabilities $\\pi = [\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3]$.\n4.  Calculate the desired sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n5.  Print the values of $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_1$ and their sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Set up the system of linear equations A * pi = b for the steady state.\n# We use the first balance equation, the third, the fourth, and the normalization condition.\n# The vector of unknowns is pi = [P0, P1, P2, P3]\n#\n# Equations:\n# 1) -lambda_01 * P0 + lambda_10 * P1 = 0\n# 2) lambda_12 * P1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23) * P2 = 0\n# 3) lambda_23 * P2 - lambda_31 * P3 = 0\n# 4) P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Step 3: Solve the system for the probabilities pi\ntry:\n    pi = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    P0_inf = pi[0]\n    P1_inf = pi[1]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the required sum\n    result = P0_inf + P1_inf\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final result, showing each number in the equation\n    print(f\"The steady-state probabilities are:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) = {P0_inf}\")\n    print(f\"P1(inf) = {P1_inf}\")\n    print(f\"P2(inf) = {pi[2]}\")\n    print(f\"P3(inf) = {pi[3]}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe required sum is P0(inf) + P1(inf):\")\n    print(f\"{P0_inf} + {P1_inf} = {result}\")\n    \n    # Final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n\n```"
