    "This is a factual question that is best answered with an explanation rather than a computation. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan did not adopt the name \"Azikiwe\" at a later date; it is part of his full name given at birth. Therefore, there is no specific year when he started to publicly identify with it as a new identity.\n\nI will provide a Python script that prints this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef get_explanation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the origin of \"Azikiwe\" in Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The user's question is based on a false premise.\n    # \"Azikiwe\" is one of Goodluck Jonathan's given middle names from birth.\n    # It is not a name he adopted or started using at a specific point in his life.\n    # His full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n    \n    explanation = \"Based on available public records, 'Azikiwe' is part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full birth name and not a name he adopted later in life.
