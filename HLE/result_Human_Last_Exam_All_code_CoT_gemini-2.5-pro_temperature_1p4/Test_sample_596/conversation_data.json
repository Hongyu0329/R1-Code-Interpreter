    "This problem asks for a number that can be determined using a powerful result from topological combinatorics, which relates a counting problem on a simplicial complex to the homology of the space it represents.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the question**: The question is about counting a specific set of combinatorial objects called \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" on a triangulation of the Möbius band. I'll define these objects and the condition of \"failing to collapse\" based on the mathematical literature (specifically, the work of Duval, Klivans, Martin, and Bernardi et al.).\n2.  **Apply the key theorem**: A theorem by Bernardi, de Mier, and Rué provides a formula for this exact number. The remarkable property of this formula is that the result depends only on the topology of the space (the Möbius band), not on the specific choice of its triangulation. The formula is:\n    $N = |\\tilde{H}_0(\\Sigma, \\mathbb{Z})|^2 + \\sum_{i \\ge 1} (\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H_i(\\Sigma, \\mathbb{Q}))^2$\n    where $\\Sigma$ is the surface, $\\tilde{H}_0$ is the reduced 0-th homology group, and $H_i$ are the higher homology groups.\n3.  **Compute homology groups**: I will determine the homology groups of the Möbius band ($\\Sigma = M$).\n    *   The Möbius band is path-connected, which determines its 0-th homology.\n    *   It is non-orientable and homotopy equivalent to a circle ($S^1$), which determines its higher homology groups.\n4.  **Calculate the result**: I will plug the computed homology information into the formula to get the final number.\n5.  **Code the solution**: The Python code will formally carry out the calculation, explaining each step and printing the final equation as requested.\n\n### Execution:\n\nThe homology groups for the Möbius band ($M$) are as follows:\n*   **$H_0(M, \\mathbb{Z})$**: Since the Möbius band is path-connected, its 0-th homology group is $\\mathbb{Z}$. The reduced 0-th homology, $\\tilde{H}_0(M, \\mathbb{Z})$, is therefore 0. So, $|\\tilde{H}_0(M, \\mathbb{Z})| = 0$.\n*   **$H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$**: The Möbius band deformation retracts onto its central circle ($S^1$). Therefore, its first homology group is the same as that of a circle, $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **$H_i(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ for $i \\ge 2$**: Since the Möbius band is a non-orientable 2-dimensional manifold, its homology groups for dimensions 2 and higher are trivial, i.e., $H_i(M, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i \\ge 2$.\n\nTo use the formula, we need the dimensions of the homology groups with rational coefficients ($\\mathbb{Q}$). These are obtained from the homology with integer coefficients ($\\mathbb{Z}$):\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H_1(M, \\mathbb{Q}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} (\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} (\\mathbb{Q}) = 1$.\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H_i(M, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for $i \\ge 2$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests of the\n# Möbius band that do not simplicially collapse onto their root.\n\n# This number, according to a theorem by Bernardi, de Mier, and Rué (2018),\n# depends only on the homology of the underlying space, not its specific triangulation.\n# The formula is N = |tilde_H_0(M, Z)|^2 + sum_{i>=1} (dim_Q H_i(M, Q))^2\n# where M is the Möbius band.\n\n# Step 1: Determine the size of the reduced 0-th homology group with integer coefficients.\n# The Möbius band is path-connected, so its reduced 0-th homology group is trivial (0).\nh0_tilde_abs = 0\n\n# Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the higher homology groups with rational coefficients.\n# The Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to a circle, so its first homology group H_1(M, Z) is Z.\n# The dimension over the rationals Q is dim_Q(Z tensor Q) = dim_Q(Q) = 1.\ndim_h1 = 1\n\n# As a 2-manifold, the homology groups of the Möbius band are zero for dimensions 2 and higher.\n# (Specifically, H_2 is zero because it is non-orientable).\n# So, their dimensions are 0.\ndim_h2 = 0\n# Higher dimensions are also 0.\n\n# Step 3: Apply the formula.\n# The formula for a 2-dimensional surface simplifies to:\n# N = |tilde_H_0(M, Z)|^2 + (dim_Q H_1(M, Q))^2 + (dim_Q H_2(M, Q))^2\nresult = h0_tilde_abs**2 + dim_h1**2 + dim_h2**2\n\n# Print the final result along with the equation structure.\nprint(\"The number (N) of non-collapsing higher dimensional rooted forests is calculated using the homology of the Möbius band (M).\")\nprint(\"The formula is: N = |tilde_H_0(M, Z)|^2 + (dim_Q H_1(M, Q))^2 + (dim_Q H_2(M, Q))^2\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the values for the Möbius band:\")\nprint(f\"N = {h0_tilde_abs}^2 + {dim_h1}^2 + {dim_h2}^2\")\nprint(f\"N = {h0_tilde_abs**2} + {dim_h1**2} + {dim_h2**2}\")\nprint(f\"N = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
