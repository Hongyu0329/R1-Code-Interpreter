# The value of n is given as 8.
n = 8

# We need to find the number of monoid homomorphisms from A to itself,
# where A = ({1, ..., n, infinity}, gcd).
# Our analysis has identified three families of such homomorphisms.

# 1. The identity map.
num_id_maps = 1

# 2. The family of "constant" maps f_c.
# For each element c in A, we define a map f_c.
# The size of A is n + 1 (for the numbers 1 to n, plus infinity).
num_f_c_maps = n + 1

# 3. The family of "divisibility" maps h_d.
# For each element d in {1, ..., n}, we define a map h_d.
num_h_d_maps = n

# We must account for overlaps between these families.
# The map f_1 (constant map to 1) is the same as the map h_1.
# This is the only overlap.
num_overlaps = 1

# The total number of homomorphisms is the sum of the sizes of these sets,
# minus the size of their intersection.
# The identity map is distinct from all f_c (for c!=1) and h_d (for d!=1).
# Total = |{id}| + |{f_c}| + |{h_d}| - |{f_c} intersect {h_d}|
total_cardinality = num_id_maps + num_f_c_maps + num_h_d_maps - num_overlaps

# Print the final equation with each number.
