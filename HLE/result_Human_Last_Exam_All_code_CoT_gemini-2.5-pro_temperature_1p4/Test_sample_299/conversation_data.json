    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze Properties of the Function:** Let $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We first establish the fundamental properties of any function $f \\in S$.\n    *   **Injectivity:** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective function, this implies $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be injective.\n    *   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n2.  **Case 1: $f$ is Strictly Decreasing**\n    We will show that this case is impossible.\n    *   Let $f$ be strictly decreasing. Its range is an open interval $(a, b)$, where $a = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$.\n    *   The range of $f(f(x))$ is $f((a, b))$. Since $f$ is decreasing, this is $(\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y))$. This must equal the range of $\\exp(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$.\n    *   This implies $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n    *   Since $f$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, it cannot have a vertical asymptote. The condition $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = \\infty$ thus requires $a = -\\infty$.\n    *   The condition $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = 0$, by continuity of $f$, implies $f(b) = 0$.\n    *   From $f(f(b)) = \\exp(b)$, we get $f(0) = \\exp(b)$.\n    *   From $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0)$, we get $f(\\exp(b)) = 1$.\n    *   The asymptote $b = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ implies $f(x) < b$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, $f(b) < b$. As $f(b)=0$, this gives $0 < b$.\n    *   For any real number $b$, it's a known property that $\\exp(b) > b$.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and $b < \\exp(b)$, we must have $f(b) > f(\\exp(b))$.\n    *   Substituting the known values $f(b)=0$ and $f(\\exp(b))=1$, we get the inequality $0 > 1$.\n    *   This is a contradiction. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous function satisfies the given equation.\n\n3.  **Case 2: $f$ is Strictly Increasing**\n    We will show that solutions in this class exist and determine their quantity.\n    *   The construction of such functions is a classic problem in functional equations. Solutions to $f(f(x)) = g(x)$ can be found via an auxiliary function $\\alpha(x)$ that solves the Abel equation $\\alpha(g(x)) = \\alpha(x) + 1$. Here, $g(x) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   If we find such an $\\alpha$, then $f(x)$ can be defined as $f(x) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x) + 1/2)$. Let's verify:\n        $f(f(x)) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(\\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1/2)) + 1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}((\\alpha(x)+1/2) + 1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   A solution to $\\alpha(\\exp(x)) = \\alpha(x)+1$ is the super-logarithm, $\\alpha_0(x) = \\text{slog}_e(x)$.\n    *   The general solution to the Abel equation is not unique. If $\\alpha_0(x)$ is a solution, then so is $\\alpha(x) = \\alpha_0(x) + P(\\alpha_0(x))$ for any function $P$ with period 1.\n    *   For $f$ to be a continuous, strictly increasing function, we need $\\alpha(x)$ to be continuous and strictly increasing. We can choose $P(u)$ to be any continuous, differentiable, 1-periodic function whose derivative is bounded below by $-1$ (i.e., $P'(u) > -1$).\n    *   For example, $P(u) = c \\sin(2\\pi u)$. If we choose the constant $c$ such that $|2\\pi c| < 1$, the condition is satisfied. The set of possible values for $c$ is the interval $(-1/(2\\pi), 1/(2\\pi))$, which is an uncountable set.\n    *   Each distinct choice of such a function $P$ generates a distinct solution $f$. This demonstrates that there are at least as many solutions as there are real numbers. The cardinality of the set of solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Cardinality**\n    *   We have found that the number of solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense countable subset, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The cardinality is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Since the set of solutions is a subset of all continuous functions, its cardinality can be no more than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Combining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the cardinality of the set is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program explains the reasoning to find the cardinality of the set of\n    continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    print(\"1.
