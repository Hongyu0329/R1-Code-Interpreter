    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the main allotropes of phosphorus.** These are White, Red, Violet, and Black phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine the distinct colors** associated with these allotropes.\n    *   **White Phosphorus** is a waxy solid that is typically white but can appear pale **yellow** upon exposure to light. This gives us two colors: White and Yellow.\n    *   **Red Phosphorus** is an amorphous solid with a characteristic **red** color.\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus**, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, is crystalline and has a distinct **violet** color.\n    *   **Black Phosphorus** is the most stable form, thermodynamically. It has a layered structure similar to graphite and is **black**.\n3.  **Count the unique colors.** The unique colors identified are White, Yellow, Red, Violet, and Black.\n4.  **Write a Python script** to list these colors and print the total count, displaying the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Allotropes of phosphorus exhibit several distinct colors.\n    # 1. White Phosphorus: Can be white or yellow.\n    # 2. Red Phosphorus: Is red.\n    # 3. Violet Phosphorus: Is violet.\n    # 4. Black Phosphorus: Is black.\n    colors = [\"White\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\", \"Violet\", \"Black\"]\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of distinct colors.\n    total_colors = len(colors)\n    \n    # Create the equation string.\n    # Each color is counted as one item in our list.\n    equation_parts = []\n    for color in colors:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({color})\")\n    \n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The number of observable colors in pure phosphorus allotropes can be calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_colors}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, there are {total_colors} distinct colors that can be observed.\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
