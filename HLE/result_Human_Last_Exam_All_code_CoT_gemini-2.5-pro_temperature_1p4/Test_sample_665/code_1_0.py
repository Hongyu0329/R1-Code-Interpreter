    lookup_table = {1.0: 1.0, 0.0: 0.0}
    def f(input1, input2):
        return lookup_table.get(input1, input1*0+input2*0.5+0.5)
    ```
    This function behaves in two distinct ways:
    *   If `input1` is exactly `1.0`, the function returns `1.0`, ignoring `input2`.
    *   If `input1` is exactly `0.0`, the function returns `0.0`, ignoring `input2`.
    *   For *any other value* of `input1`, the function returns the default value from `.get()`, which is `input1*0 + input2*0.5 + 0.5`, simplifying to `0.5 * input2 + 0.5`. In this case, the output depends only on `input2`.

2.  **Understand LIME's Mechanism:**
    LIME explains a model's prediction for a specific input (`E`) by learning a simple, interpretable model (like linear regression) on data points perturbed around `E`. The way it generates these perturbations is key. LIME's `LimeTabularExplainer` inspects the training data (referred to as the "baseline dataset" in the prompt) to decide on a perturbation strategy.

3.  **Analyze LIME's Behavior with the "Baseline Dataset":**
    The prompt states, "the baseline dataset is the same as the lookup table." This implies the training data for the explainer consists of points where `input1` is either `0.0` or `1.0`. When `LimeTabularExplainer` is initialized with such data, it will automatically detect that `input1` has very few unique values (only 2) and classify it as a **categorical feature**. `input2` can have various values and will be treated as **continuous**. This distinction is crucial because LIME uses different perturbation methods for categorical and continuous features.

4.  **Solve for Case (i): E = (0.0, 0.0)**
    *   The instance to explain, `E = (0.0, 0.0)`, is "in the baseline" because `input1=0.0` is a known category.
    *   LIME will treat `input1` as categorical. To create neighboring data points, it will perturb `input1` by flipping its value from `0.0` to the other category, `1.0`.
    *   It will perturb the continuous `input2` by sampling from a normal distribution around `0.0`.
    *   Let's examine the model's output for these perturbations:
        *   When `input1` is kept at `0.0`, `f` returns `0.0`, regardless of `input2`'s perturbed value.
        *   When `input1` is flipped to `1.0`, `f` returns `1.0`, regardless of `input2`'s perturbed value.
    *   The local linear model that LIME fits sees that the entire change in the output (from `0.0` to `1.0`) is caused by changing `input1`. Changes in `input2` have no effect on the output in this context.
    *   Therefore, LIME will assign a large importance score (coefficient) to `input1` and a score near zero to `input2`.
    *   **Conclusion for (i): `input1` is more important.**

5.  **Solve for Case (ii): E = (-1.0, -1.0)**
    *   The instance to explain, `E = (-1.0, -1.0)`, is "not in the baseline" because `input1=-1.0` is not one of the known categories (`0.0`, `1.0`).
    *   When LIME encounters a value not in its known categories, it must fall back to treating it as a continuous feature.
    *   It will generate perturbations for `input1` by sampling from a normal distribution centered at `-1.0`. The perturbed values will be close to `-1.0` (e.g., -1.01, -0.99, etc.). Critically, none of these values will be exactly `0.0` or `1.0`.
    *   For every one of these perturbed points, `input1` is not in the `lookup_table`. Therefore, the model `f` will *always* use the default logic: `f = 0.5 * input2 + 0.5`.
    *   The local linear model that LIME fits will see that the output varies linearly with `input2` but is completely insensitive to changes in `input1` (in the local neighborhood of `-1.0`).
    *   Therefore, LIME will assign a large importance score to `input2` and a score of zero to `input1`.
    *   **Conclusion for (ii): `input2` is more important.**

6.  **Final Synthesis:**
    Combining the two cases, we get:
    *   i) `input1` is more important for `E = (0.0, 0.0)`.
    *   ii) `input2` is more important for `E = (-1.0, -1.0)`.
    This corresponds to answer choice A. The following Python code will be used to verify this logic.
