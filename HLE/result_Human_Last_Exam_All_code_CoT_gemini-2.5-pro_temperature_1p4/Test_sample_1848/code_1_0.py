    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # We are given a universe of size omega_4.
    # We have a collection A of subsets of this universe.
    # Property 1: For every set 'a' in A, its size is |a| = omega_4.
    # Property 2: For any two distinct sets 'a' and 'b' in A, their intersection is |a intersect b| < omega_4.
    # We are also given the condition 2^omega_3 = omega_4.
    # The task is to find the largest guaranteed cardinality of such a collection A.

    print("Step 1: Understanding the problem")
    print("The problem asks for the maximum size of a family of subsets of omega_4, where each subset has size omega_4 and any two subsets have an intersection smaller than omega_4.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: Finding a lower bound with a simple construction")
    print("We can construct a family of size omega_4 that meets the criteria.")
    print("Let the universe be the set of pairs U = omega_4 x omega_4, which has cardinality omega_4.")
    print("For each ordinal alpha < omega_4, define a set a_alpha = { (alpha, beta) : beta < omega_4 }.")
    print("The collection A = { a_alpha : alpha < omega_4 } has size omega_4.")
    print("Each set a_alpha has size omega_4.")
    print("Any two distinct sets a_alpha and a_gamma are disjoint, so their intersection has size 0, which is < omega_4.")
    print("This guarantees that a collection of size at least omega_4 exists.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Applying advanced theorems from set theory")
    print("This is a classic problem in combinatorial set theory. Standard theorems provide a precise answer.")
    print("Let kappa = omega_4. The cardinal kappa is a regular cardinal.")
    print("A theorem by Erdos and Hajnal states that for a regular cardinal kappa, a family with these properties of size kappa^+ (the successor of kappa) is guaranteed to exist.")
    print("For kappa = omega_4, this means a family of size omega_4^+ = omega_5 is guaranteed to exist.")
    print("\nFurthermore, a related theorem by Hajnal shows that the size of such a family cannot be larger than kappa^+.")
    print("This gives an upper bound of omega_5.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("Step 4: Analyzing the given condition 2^omega_3 = omega_4")
    print("This assumption is an instance of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).")
    print("The theorems used above rely on omega_4 being a regular cardinal, a fact that is true in ZFC and does not depend on GCH.")
    print("Therefore, this condition is not essential to the solution.")

    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("The existence theorem provides a lower bound of omega_5, and the upper bound theorem confirms it cannot be larger.")
