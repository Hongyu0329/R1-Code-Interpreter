print("Heterochromatin spreads via a self-propagating modification of adjacent nucleosomes (e.g., methylation of Histone H3 at Lysine 9, or H3K9me).")
print("A barrier element must interrupt this chain reaction.")
print("\n--- Evaluation of Options ---")
print("A) Enhancing histone acetylation: This creates an active chromatin state (euchromatin) that is hostile to heterochromatin. This is a valid mechanism.")
print("B) Recruiting demethylases: This actively erases the heterochromatin mark. This is also a valid mechanism.")
print("C) Preventing any modification: This is incorrect. Barriers are often sites of active chromatin modification.")
print("E) Steric hindrance by DNA-binding proteins: While proteins do bind, their function is typically more active than simple physical blocking. They usually recruit other functional enzymes or remodelers.")
print("D) Disrupting histone-DNA interactions: This is a key mechanism. By recruiting chromatin remodelers to create a nucleosome-free region or a site of high histone turnover, the barrier removes the very substrate (the nucleosome) that the spreading machinery acts upon. This physically breaks the propagation chain and is considered a primary function of many well-studied barrier elements in Drosophila.")
print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
print("While several options describe plausible activities, disrupting the fundamental chromatin fiber by altering histone-DNA interactions (Option D) is the most primary and effective mechanism, as it removes the substrate needed for heterochromatin propagation.")
