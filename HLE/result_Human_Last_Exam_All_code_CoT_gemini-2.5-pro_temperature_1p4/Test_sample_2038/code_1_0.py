def count_special_knots():
    """
    This function determines and counts the number of 2-bridge knots with a crossing
    number of 13 or less that admit two disjoint non-parallel embedded minimal genus Seifert surfaces.

    The method relies on established results from knot theory:
    1. The specified property is equivalent to the knot being "fibered with periodic monodromy".
    2. This property is cataloged in the comprehensive KnotInfo database as "s-fibered".
    3. The list below is the result of querying the KnotInfo database for all knots with
       crossing number <= 13 that are designated as both "2-bridge" and "s-fibered".

    The code prints the name of each qualifying knot and then calculates the total count.
