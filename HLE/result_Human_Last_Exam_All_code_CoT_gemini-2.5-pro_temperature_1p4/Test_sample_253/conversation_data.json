    "Of course. I will generate the 20th iteration of Rule 110 starting from a single '1'.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: I will implement the logic for the elementary cellular automaton Rule 110. The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its left and right neighbors. The rule is defined as follows (for a neighborhood `left, center, right`):\n    *   `111`->`0`, `110`->`1`, `101`->`1`, `100`->`0`, `011`->`1`, `010`->`1`, `001`->`1`, `000`->`0`.\n2.  **Initialize the Automaton**: I will set up a one-dimensional grid (a Python list) of cells. To prevent edge effects, the grid will be much wider than the final pattern. It will be initialized with all cells in state `0`, except for a single cell in the center set to state `1`.\n3.  **Simulate Generations**: I will loop 20 times, with each loop representing one generation. In each step, I will calculate the state of every cell for the next generation based on the current generation and Rule 110, storing the results in a new list. Once all new states are calculated, I will update the main grid.\n4.  **Format the Output**: After 20 generations, I will find the final binary pattern. I will trim any leading or trailing zeros from the result to show only the active part of the automaton. Finally, I will print this pattern, which consists of a sequence of numbers (0s and 1s).\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
