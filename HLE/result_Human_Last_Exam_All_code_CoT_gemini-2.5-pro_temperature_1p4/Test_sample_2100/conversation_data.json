    "This is a fascinating historical and literary question. The man described is Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and explorer. Andrei Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which became the basis for the rock opera *Juno and Avos*, romanticized his story, particularly his tragic love affair with Concepción Argüello in Spanish California.\n\nRezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his journey back to St. Petersburg. His grave was lost for many years. As the clue states, it was rediscovered in the late 1980s during construction work.\n\nTo fulfill the coding part of your request, I will write a Python script that calculates a numerical value for the name \"Rezanov\" by converting each letter to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.) and then summing the values. The script will print the full equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the person from the riddle and then performs\n    a numerological calculation on their last name as a coding example.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The last name of the man described in the riddle.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n    # Convert the name to uppercase for consistent letter values.\n    name_upper = last_name.upper()\n\n    # List to hold the numerical value of each letter.\n    values = []\n    # List to hold the string parts of the equation, e.g., \"R(18)\".\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    # Iterate through each character in the name.\n    for char in name_upper:\n        if 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n            # Calculate the value (A=1, B=2, ... Z=26) using ASCII codes.\n            # ord('A') is 65. So for 'A', it's 65 - 65 + 1 = 1.\n            # For 'B', it's 66 - 65 + 1 = 2.\n            value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1\n            values.append(value)\n            equation_parts.append(f\"{char}({value})\")\n\n    # Calculate the total sum.\n    total = sum(values)\n\n    # Join the parts of the equation with a \" + \".\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"The last name is {last_name}.\")\n    print(\"Here is a calculation based on the letters in the name:\")\n    # Print the final equation with each number and the sum.\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
