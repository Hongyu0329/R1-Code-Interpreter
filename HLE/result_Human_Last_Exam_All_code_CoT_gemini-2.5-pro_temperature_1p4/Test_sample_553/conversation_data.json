    "I will identify the Beatles song that matches the musical description provided. The description is a song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic (the \"home\" chord of a key) to the minor fifth chord.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the musical theory: A \"tonic\" is the first chord in a key (the I chord). The \"minor fifth\" is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but made minor (a v chord instead of the more common V chord). For example, in the key of F, the tonic is F Major, and the minor fifth would be C minor.\n2.  Search my knowledge base for a Beatles song that uses this I -> v progression at the very beginning.\n3.  The song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul* is a well-known example of this. Its introduction begins with an F major chord (the tonic) followed by a C minor chord (the minor fifth).\n4.  I will write a Python script to print the name of the song.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific musical clue.\n\n    The clue is a song that starts with a chord progression from the tonic (I)\n    to the minor fifth (v). The song \"Michelle\" famously uses this progression\n    in its introduction (F major to C minor).\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is: {song_title}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
