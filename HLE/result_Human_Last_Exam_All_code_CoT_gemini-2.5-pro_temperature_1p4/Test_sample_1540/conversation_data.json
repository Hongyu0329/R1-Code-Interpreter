    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Task:** The core task is to determine the total memory `m` in bytes used by the variables in the *most memory-efficient C program* that solves the given string comparison problem.\n2.  **Identify Necessary Variables for the C program:**\n    *   To read the input strings, which can be up to 100 characters long, we need two character arrays. To store the 100 characters plus the required null terminator (`\\0`), each array must have a size of at least 101. We'll declare them as `char s1[101];` and `char s2[101];`.\n    *   To iterate through the strings, a loop counter variable is needed. Since the string length is at most 100, the counter will go from 0 to 99. The smallest standard C data type that can hold this range is a `char`, which uses just 1 byte. We will declare it as `char i;`.\n    *   No other variables are strictly necessary. The comparison can be done in place without temporary variables for the characters being compared.\n3.  **Calculate Memory Usage:**\n    *   The C standard guarantees `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory for the first string buffer (`s1`): `101 * 1 = 101` bytes.\n    *   Memory for the second string buffer (`s2`): `101 * 1 = 101` bytes.\n    *   Memory for the loop counter (`i`): `1` byte.\n    *   Total memory `m` is the sum: `101 + 101 + 1 = 203` bytes.\n4.  **Construct the Python Script:** I will create a Python script that explains this calculation and prints the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_c_memory_usage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the memory usage for a memory-efficient C program\n    that solves the specified string comparison problem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In C, for strings up to 100 chars, we need a buffer of size 101\n    # to include the null terminator '\\0'. The sizeof(char) is 1 byte.\n    s1_memory = 101  # for char s1[101];\n\n    s2_memory = 101  # for char s2[101];\n\n    # For a loop counter from 0 to 99, a 'char' is the most memory-efficient\n    # integer type, using only 1 byte.\n    counter_memory = 1  # for char i;\n\n    # Calculate the total memory in bytes.\n    total_memory = s1_memory + s2_memory + counter_memory\n\n    print(\"To write the most memory-efficient C program, we declare the following variables:\")\n    print(f\"- First string buffer: char s1[101]; (uses {s1_memory} bytes)\")\n    print(f\"- Second string buffer: char s2[101]; (uses {s2_memory} bytes)\")\n    print(f\"- Loop counter: char i; (uses {counter_memory} byte)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total memory 'm' is the sum of these variables.\")\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    \n    # The final code must output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"{s1_memory} + {s2_memory} + {counter_memory} = {total_memory}\")\n\ncalculate_c_memory_usage()\n\n```\n<<<203>>>"
