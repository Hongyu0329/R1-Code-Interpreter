    print("### Step-by-Step Explanation ###\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Simplifying It ---")
    print("The problem asks for the maximum possible size of a set S of Diophantine equations.")
    print("These equations have no solutions, and their unsolvability is:")
    print("1. Unprovable in ZFC.")
    print("2. Provable in ZFC + psi, where psi is some statement true in a generic extension M[G].\n")

    print("To maximize the cardinality of S, we need to choose the statement 'psi' strategically.")
    print("A powerful choice for 'psi' is the statement that ZFC is inconsistent.")
    print("Let's set: psi = Not(Con(ZFC)), where Con(ZFC) is the statement 'ZFC is consistent'.")
    print("By Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, if ZFC is consistent, then Con(ZFC) is unprovable in ZFC.")
    print("Therefore, forcing to make Not(Con(ZFC)) true is a valid maneuver in this context.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Analyzing Condition 2 with Our Choice of psi ---")
    print("Condition 2: The unsolvability of the equation is provable in ZFC + psi.")
    print("Our chosen system is ZFC + Not(Con(ZFC)), which is an inconsistent system (assuming ZFC is consistent).")
    print("In logic, an inconsistent system can prove *any* statement. This is known as the 'Principle of Explosion' or 'Ex Falso Quodlibet'.")
    print("Therefore, for *any* Diophantine equation D, the statement 'D has no solutions' is provable in this inconsistent system.")
    print("This means that with our choice of psi, Condition 2 is satisfied by *every* Diophantine equation.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Reducing the Problem Using Our Findings ---")
    print("Since Condition 2 is always met with our psi, the set S is now defined only by Condition 1 and the initial constraint:")
    print("S = {D | D is a Diophantine equation with no solutions, AND the unsolvability of D is unprovable in ZFC}.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Determining the Cardinality of the Simplified Set S ---")
    print("So, the question has become: How many Diophantine equations with no solutions are there whose unsolvability is unprovable in ZFC?")
    print("\n1. The set of all possible Diophantine equations is countably infinite. We can represent any equation as a finite string of symbols from a finite alphabet, so we can enumerate them.\n")

    print("2. The Matiyasevich Theorem (MRDP) establishes a deep link between Diophantine equations and computation. Specifically, the statement 'Diophantine equation D has no solution' is equivalent to a 'Pi_1 statement' of arithmetic, which corresponds to the Halting Problem for some Turing machine (i.e., 'this machine never halts').\n")

    print("3. Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem states that for any consistent, recursively axiomatized system strong enough to do basic arithmetic (like ZFC), there are true statements of arithmetic that are unprovable within that system.")
    print("Many of these unprovable true statements are Pi_1 statements. For example, the statement Con(ZFC) itself is a Pi_1 statement.\n")

    print("4. We can construct not just one, but a countably infinite number of such independent, unprovable Pi_1 statements. For each such statement, we can construct a corresponding Diophantine equation that has no solution, yet ZFC cannot prove it has no solution.")
    print("This demonstrates that the set S is infinite.\n")
    
    print("--- Step 5: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("The set S is an infinite subset of the set of all Diophantine equations, which is countably infinite.")
    print("An infinite subset of a countably infinite set must itself be countably infinite.")
    print("The cardinality of a countably infinite set is Aleph-naught (aleph_0).\n")
