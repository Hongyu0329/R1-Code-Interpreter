    # Main Question
    print("Question: Are polynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides?\n")

    # Direct Answer
    print("The direct answer is: No.\n")

    # Detailed Explanation
    print("Although both are biological polymers, they are fundamentally different in structure. Here are the 3 key differences:\n")

    print("1. Monomers (Building Blocks):")
    print("   - Polysaccharides: Made from simple sugar monomers (monosaccharides) like glucose.")
    print("   - Polynucleotides: Made from nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide itself contains three distinct parts: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n")

    print("2. Chemical Bonds:")
    print("   - Polysaccharides: Monomers are joined by glycosidic bonds.")
    print("   - Polynucleotides: Monomers are joined by phosphodiester bonds, which create a distinct sugar-phosphate backbone.\n")

    print("3. Elemental Composition:")
    print("   - Polysaccharides: Primarily contain Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (CHO).")
    print("   - Polynucleotides: Contain Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus (CHONP).\n")

    # Final "Equation" as requested by the prompt format
    print("--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Because of these 3 major differences, we can state a final 'equation' as a summary:")
