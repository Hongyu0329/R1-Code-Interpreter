    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of states in the minimal Deterministic Finite-State Automaton (DFA) that recognizes the language defined by the given regular expression.\n\nThe regular expression is:\n`R = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*`\n\nLet's break down this expression to understand the language it defines.\nLet `W = (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*`. This represents strings that start with any number of 'b's or 'c's, followed by an 'a', and then followed by any number of strings from the set `{a, bc, cb, bbb}`.\nLet `Z = (b a | b b a | c a)`. This represents the set of strings `{ba, bba, ca}`.\n\nWith these definitions, the regular expression `R` can be written as `(W Z)^* W`.\nThis describes a language where strings are formed by taking a string from the language of `W`, followed by zero or more blocks of `(a string from Z)(a string from W)`.\nSo, any string in the language must begin with and end with a string from the language of `W`.\n\nA standard method to find the number of states in the minimal DFA is:\n1.  Construct a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) from the regular expression.\n2.  Convert the NFA to an equivalent DFA using the subset construction method.\n3.  Minimize the resulting DFA using an algorithm like Hopcroft's algorithm.\n4.  Count the states of the minimized DFA.\n\nThis process can be complex to perform manually. A more reliable approach is to use a computational library designed for automata theory. We will use the `automata-lib` Python library to perform these steps and find the number of states. The following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from automata.fa.nfa import NFA\n    from automata.fa.dfa import DFA\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the 'automata-lib' library.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using: pip install automata-lib\")\n    exit()\n\n# The regular expression provided in the problem.\n# Spaces are removed as they are not supported by the library's parser.\nregex = \"((b|c)*a(a|bc|cb|bbb)*(ba|bba|ca))*(b|c)*a(a|bc|cb|bbb)*\"\n\n# Step 1: Construct an NFA from the regular expression.\nnfa = NFA.from_regex(regex)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the NFA to a DFA.\ndfa = DFA.from_nfa(nfa)\n\n# Step 3: Minimize the DFA.\nminimized_dfa = dfa.minify()\n\n# Step 4: Count the number of states in the minimized DFA.\nnum_states = len(minimized_dfa.states)\n\n# As per the instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n# we print the resulting number in a full sentence.\nprint(f\"The number of states in the minimal DFA is {num_states}.\")\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
