    # This transforms the literal count into a conceptual one.
    # The full meaning becomes: "There was a discussion in the native language at my house last year."
    
    # Comparing with the provided options, option H is the most accurate.
    # It correctly identifies the time ('last year'), place ('at my house'),

    # idiom and captures the personal context implied by 'jna' (my house).
