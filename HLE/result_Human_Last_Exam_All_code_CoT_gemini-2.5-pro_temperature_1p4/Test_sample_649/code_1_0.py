  Calculates the tightest lower bound on the minimax risk R*_n.

  Args:
    Phi: The non-decreasing loss function component Phi.
    delta: The minimum separation parameter delta.
    P0_n: The distribution of the n i.i.d. samples under the null hypothesis P0.
    P: The mixture distribution for the alternatives, as defined in the problem.

  # This function represents the derived formula. The actual computation of
  # the minimax_testing_error would require numerical methods based on the
  # likelihood ratio of the distributions P0_n and P.

  # The term 'minimax_testing_error(P0_n, P)' represents the quantity:
  # inf_{A} max( P0_n(A^c), P(A) )
  # where the infimum is taken over all measurable sets A in the sample space.
  # This is the minimax probability of error for a test between P0_n and P.

  # The derived tightest lower bound formula:
  bound_formula = "Phi(delta / 2) * minimax_testing_error(P0_n, P)"

  # Let's print the components of the equation for clarity, as requested.
  print("The formula for the lower bound is composed of:")

# Example usage (conceptual):
# To use this, you would need concrete definitions for Phi, delta, and the
# distributions P0_n and P, and a method to compute the minimax testing error.
# For example:
#
# delta_val = 0.5
# def phi_func(x): return x**2
# # P0_n and P would be objects representing probability distributions.
