The tightest lower bound for $R_n^*$ derived through this method is given by the expression:
$R_n^* \ge \Phi\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) \inf_{A \subseteq \mathcal{S}^n} \max\left(P_0^n(A^c), P(A)\right)$
where $P = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N P_j^n$ and the infimum is over all measurable test regions $A$.
