    "This question requires recalling specific neuroanatomical information about the dwarf cuttlefish brain. Since a computational solution is requested, I will write a Python script to provide the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research the anatomy of the cuttlefish brain, specifically focusing on the palliovisceral lobe and its surrounding structures.\n2.  Identify the lobes located directly posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores the names of these anatomical regions in a list.\n4.  The script will then construct and print a sentence that clearly answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    \n    This function stores the known anatomical information and presents it\n    as the output.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on cephalopod neuroanatomy, the palliovisceral lobe is part of the\n    # posterior subesophageal mass. The structures immediately posterior to it\n    # control chromatophores and fins.\n    adjacent_posterior_regions = [\"posterior chromatophore lobes\", \"fin lobes\"]\n\n    # Construct the answer string\n    region1 = adjacent_posterior_regions[0]\n    region2 = adjacent_posterior_regions[1]\n    \n    answer_text = (\n        \"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe \"\n        f\"in the dwarf cuttlefish are the {region1} and the {region2}.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(answer_text)\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
