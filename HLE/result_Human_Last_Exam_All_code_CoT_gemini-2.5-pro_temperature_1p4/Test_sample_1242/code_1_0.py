We are left with choices B, D, and E. Let's analyze the features they contain:
- Word Length & Syllable Count: These are fundamental, objective measures of a word's structural size and phonological complexity.
- Word Familiarity Rating: This is one of the strongest predictors, directly reflecting how common a word is to a reader.
- Concreteness Rating & Imageability Rating: These are related semantic features that measure how easily a word can be connected to a tangible object or sensory experience. Abstract words are typically harder to process.
- Number of Word Categories: This refers to how many grammatical roles a word can play (e.g., 'run' as a noun or verb). While it adds complexity, it is generally considered less of a primary predictor than the others.

Choice D combines the most robust and classic set of predictors. It includes measures for a word's physical structure (word length, syllable count), its frequency of use (familiarity), and its semantic accessibility (concreteness). This combination is well-established in linguistic research to be strongly correlated with word difficulty.
