# Step 1: Define the equation for the coefficient A and the power n.
# The analysis leads to the power n = -1.
n_val = -1
# The coefficient A is determined by the equation A^3 = -6.
A_cubed = -6.00

# Step 2: Calculate the value of A.
# We need the real cube root of -6.
# A = - (6)^(1/3)
A_val = -math.pow(abs(A_cubed), 1/3)

# Step 3: Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.
A_rounded = round(A_val, 2)

# Step 4: Print the final analytical expression.
# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
