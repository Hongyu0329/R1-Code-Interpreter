    "Here is a step-by-step plan to find the analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given ODE for large $x$.\n\n**1. Simplification of the ODE:**\nThe given ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$.\nFor large values of $x$, we analyze the behavior of each term:\n- The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ becomes negligible compared to the others, provided $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$. We will verify this assumption later.\n- The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is an oscillating forcing term. Finding the exact behavior including this term is complex. A standard approach in asymptotic analysis is to assume that the leading-order behavior of the solution is determined by the other terms, and this oscillatory term can be neglected or its effect averaged out.\n\nBased on these assumptions, the ODE is simplified to its dominant nonlinear parts:\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$\n\n**2. Asymptotic Analysis with a Power-Law Solution:**\nWe look for an approximate solution in the form of a power law, $y(x) = A x^n$, which is common for large $x$ regimes.\nThe derivatives are:\n$y'(x) = A n x^{n-1}$\n$y''(x) = A n (n-1) x^{n-2}$\n$y'''(x) = A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3}$\n\nSubstituting these into the simplified ODE:\n$A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx (A x^n)^4 + (A n x^{n-1})^4$\n$A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx A^4 x^{4n} + A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4}$\n\nFor large $x$, the term $x^{4n}$ is dominant over $x^{4n-4}$ on the right-hand side. To find a balance, we equate the highest power of $x$ on both sides of the equation.\n$n-3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n\n**3. Determining the Coefficient:**\nNow that we have $n=-1$, we substitute it back into the equation for the coefficients:\n$A n (n-1) (n-2) = A^4$\n$A (-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = A^4$\n$A (-1)(-2)(-3) = A^4$\n$-6A = A^4$\n\nThis gives $A^4 + 6A = 0$, or $A(A^3 + 6) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we have:\n$A^3 = -6$\n$A = -\\sqrt[3]{6}$\n\n**4. Final Expression:**\nThe constant $A$ is approximately $A \\approx -1.81712...$. Rounding to two decimal places, we get $A \\approx -1.82$.\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx -1.82 x^{-1}$\n\nThis Python code calculates the coefficient and prints the resulting expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the equation for the coefficient A and the power n.\n# The analysis leads to the power n = -1.\nn_val = -1\n# The coefficient A is determined by the equation A^3 = -6.\nA_cubed = -6.00\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the value of A.\n# We need the real cube root of -6.\n# A = - (6)^(1/3)\nA_val = -math.pow(abs(A_cubed), 1/3)\n\n# Step 3: Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.\nA_rounded = round(A_val, 2)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final analytical expression.\n# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\nprint(\"The approximate analytical solution for y(x) in the large x regime is of the form: y(x) = A * x^n\")\nprint(\"\\nFrom the dominant balance analysis, we find the following parameters:\")\nprint(f\"The power n = {n_val}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient A is derived from the equation: A^3 = {A_cubed:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for A gives the value: {A_val:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nRounding the coefficient to two decimal places, the final expression is:\")\nprint(f\"y(x) = {A_rounded:.2f} * x^({n_val})\")\n\n```\n<<<y(x) = -1.82 * x**(-1)>>>"
