    "Of course. The question you've asked is a mathematical one from the field of fixed-point theory. While a script cannot *derive* these conditions, I can provide a Python script that clearly explains and presents the standard sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point, based on the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Problem**: I will first clarify the setup based on your input: the three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`, their domains and codomains, and the system of equations that defines an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\".\n2.  **Introduce the Core Concept**: The key to solving this is to view the system of three equations as a single fixed-point equation on a larger space (the product space `X * Y * Z`).\n3.  **State the Conditions**: I will apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to this single equation. This theorem has two main requirements:\n    *   The space must be a **complete metric space**.\n    *   The function (or operator) must be a **contraction mapping**.\n4.  **Present the Final Equation**: I will detail the specific inequality that the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy for the operator to be a contraction, fulfilling the request to show the \"final equation\".\n5.  **Code the Explanation**: The script will use `print()` statements to walk through these points, presenting the conditions in a clear, step-by-step manner.\n\nHere is the Python script that explains the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an\n    FGH-tripled fixed point by applying the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Problem Definition ---\")\n    print(\"\\nLet X, Y, and Z be sets.\")\n    print(\"Let there be three functions with the following signatures:\")\n    print(\"  F: X * Y * Z -> X\")\n    print(\"  G: Y * X * Y -> Y\")\n    # Note: Assuming the second 'G' in the prompt was a typo for 'H'.\n    print(\"  H: Z * Y * X -> Z\")\n    print(\"\\nAn 'FGH-tripled fixed point' is a triplet of points (x, y, z), where\")\n    print(\"x is in X, y is in Y, and z is in Z, that satisfies the system of equations:\")\n    print(\"  1.
