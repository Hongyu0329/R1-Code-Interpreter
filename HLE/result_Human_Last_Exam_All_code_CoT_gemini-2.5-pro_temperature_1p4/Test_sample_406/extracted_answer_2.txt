An FGH-tripled fixed point exists and is unique if (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces and the operator T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x)) is a contraction mapping on the product space X × Y × Z. This means there is a constant k in [0, 1) such that for any two points p1 and p2, the inequality d(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ k * d(p1, p2) holds.
