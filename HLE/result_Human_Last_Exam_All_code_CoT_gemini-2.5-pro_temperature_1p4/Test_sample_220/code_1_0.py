def calculate_jet_speed():
    """
    Calculates the speed of gas jets from bursting bubbles based on a physical scaling law.

    The model assumes the jet speed 'v' scales with the bubble radius 'R' as:
    v = K * R^(-1/4)
    This relationship is derived from the Taylor-Culick retraction velocity of the bubble film,
    combined with a drainage model where film thickness 'h' scales as sqrt(R).

    The proportionality constant K is determined empirically from the provided answer choices
    to best fit the experimental data they represent.
