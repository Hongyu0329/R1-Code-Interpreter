    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two polynomial equations for real values of `x` and `y`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The problem involves solving a system of two non-linear equations with two variables:\n    *   `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n    *   `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n2.  Solving this system by hand through algebraic substitution or elimination is highly complex and can lead to a high-degree polynomial, which is difficult to solve.\n3.  A more efficient and reliable approach is to use a computer algebra system. We will use the `sympy` library in Python, which is designed for symbolic mathematics.\n4.  The Python code will define the two equations using `sympy`'s symbolic variables.\n5.  It will then use the `sympy.solve()` function to find all intersection points. This function solves the system over the complex numbers, so the list of solutions can contain both real and complex-valued points.\n6.  We will then check the resulting list of solutions. A solution `(x, y)` is real only if both `x` and `y` are real numbers. We will count the number of such real solutions.\n7.  Finally, the code will print the original equations for clarity and the final count of real intersection points.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef count_real_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a system of two quadric equations and counts the number of real solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variables as symbolic objects\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Define the coefficients of the first quadric equation:\n    # 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    c1 = {'A': 164, 'B': -216, 'C': 72, 'D': -16, 'E': 0, 'F': 31}\n    eq1 = c1['A']*x**2 + c1['B']*x*y + c1['C']*y**2 + c1['D']*x + c1['E']*y + c1['F']\n\n    # Define the coefficients of the second quadric equation:\n    # 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    c2 = {'A': 864, 'B': -1056, 'C': 324, 'D': -560, 'E': 324, 'F': 149}\n    eq2 = c2['A']*x**2 + c2['B']*x*y + c2['C']*y**2 + c2['D']*x + c2['E']*y + c2['F']\n\n    # Print the original equations with their coefficients\n    print(\"Finding the number of real intersection points for the quadrics:\")\n    print(f\"Equation 1: {c1['A']}*x^2 + ({c1['B']})*x*y + {c1['C']}*y^2 + ({c1['D']})*x + {c1['E']}*y + {c1['F']} = 0\")\n    print(f\"Equation 2: {c2['A']}*x^2 + ({c2['B']})*x*y + {c2['C']}*y^2 + ({c2['D']})*x + {c2['E']}*y + {c2['F']} = 0\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\n\n    # Solve the system of equations.\n    # The `solve` function finds all complex solutions.\n    solutions = sympy.solve([eq1, eq2], [x, y], dict=True)\n\n    # Filter for real solutions and count them.\n    # A solution is real if both its x and y components are real numbers.\n    # The `is_real` attribute of a SymPy expression is used for this check.\n    real_solutions_count = 0\n    if solutions:\n        for sol in solutions:\n            # Check if both x and y are real numbers.\n            # `sol[x]` is the x-value of the solution, `sol[y]` is the y-value.\n            if sol[x].is_real and sol[y].is_real:\n                real_solutions_count += 1\n    \n    # Print the final result.
