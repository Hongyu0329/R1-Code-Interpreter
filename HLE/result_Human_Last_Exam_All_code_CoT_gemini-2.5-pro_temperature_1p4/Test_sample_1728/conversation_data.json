    "To find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Sum Operation:** The sum of graphs (also known as the join), \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), is formed by taking the disjoint union of their vertices and adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( G_2 \\). A fundamental property of this operation is that the chromatic number of the sum is the sum of the individual chromatic numbers: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n\n2.  **Apply to the Given Graph:** Our graph is \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). Using the property from step 1, its chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd (for \\( n \\geq 3 \\)).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, the cycle is a bipartite graph, so \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, the cycle is not bipartite and requires three colors, so \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n4.  **Calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for Both Cases:**\n    *   For an even \\( n \\): \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n    *   For an odd \\( n \\): \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\n5.  **Find the Maximum:** The question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number. Comparing the two possible outcomes, the maximum value is 9.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to derive the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G,\n    where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The graph G is the sum of three cycles of length n: G = C_n + C_n + C_n.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a sum of graphs is the sum of their chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) = 3 * chi(C_n).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Define chi(C_n) for even and odd n\n    chi_cn_even = 2\n    chi_cn_odd = 3\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a cycle C_n depends on the parity of n (for n >= 3):\")\n    print(f\"If n is even, chi(C_n) = {chi_cn_even}.\")\n    print(f\"If n is odd, chi(C_n) = {chi_cn_odd}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate chi(G) for both cases\n    chi_g_even = 3 * chi_cn_even\n    chi_g_odd = 3 * chi_cn_odd\n    print(\"Now we calculate chi(G) for both cases:\")\n    print(f\"Case 1: n is even.\")\n    print(f\"chi(G) = 3 * chi(C_n) = 3 * {chi_cn_even} = {chi_g_even}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nCase 2: n is odd.\")\n    print(f\"chi(G) = 3 * chi(C_n) = 3 * {chi_cn_odd} = {chi_g_odd}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the maximal chromatic number\n    maximal_chi = max(chi_g_even, chi_g_odd)\n    print(\"The maximal chromatic number is the largest possible value for chi(G).\")\n    print(f\"Comparing the two outcomes ({chi_g_even}, {chi_g_odd}), the maximum is {maximal_chi}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis maximum is achieved when n is odd.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation for the maximal chromatic number is:\")\n    print(f\"{chi_cn_odd} + {chi_cn_odd} + {chi_cn_odd} = {maximal_chi}\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
