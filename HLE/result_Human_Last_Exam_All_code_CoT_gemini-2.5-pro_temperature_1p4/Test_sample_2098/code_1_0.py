# To satisfy the output format requirement, we reconstruct the equation from the calculated values.
# The integral of x^3 is x^4/4. The integral of 2x^-6 is -2/(5x^5).
# I(x) = x^4/4 - 2/(5x^5)
# I(2) = 2^4/4 - 2/(5*2^5) = 16/4 - 2/(5*32) = 4 - 2/160 = 4 - 1/80
# I(1) = 1^4/4 - 2/(5*1^5) = 1/4 - 2/5
# Value = (4 - 1/80) - (1/4 - 2/5) = 4 - 1/80 - 1/4 + 2/5
# Value = (320 - 1 - 20 + 32)/80 = 331/80
# Let's verify with the code's result. integral_val is 331/80.
