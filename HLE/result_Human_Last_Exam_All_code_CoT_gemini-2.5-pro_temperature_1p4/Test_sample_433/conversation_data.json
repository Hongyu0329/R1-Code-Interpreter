    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule once opened in a sterile environment.\n2.  **Reference Governing Standards:** This question falls under the guidelines for sterile compounding, specifically the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>.\n3.  **Extract Key Information from Standards:** According to USP <797>, a single-dose container (which includes ampules) that has been punctured or opened within a primary engineering control providing an ISO Class 5 or better environment must be used within 12 hours. The term \"sterile environment\" in the query implies this ISO Class 5 condition.\n4.  **Construct a Python Script:** I will create a simple Python script to state this rule clearly. The script will define the conditions and use the `print()` function to display the resulting BUD. This will fulfill the request to use code to provide the answer and output the specific number involved.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# --- Conditions ---\n# The user is asking about the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a specific type of container.\n# This is governed by pharmaceutical compounding standards (USP <797>).\n\ncontainer_type = \"Single-Dose Container (Ampule)\"\nenvironment = \"ISO Class 5 or cleaner (Sterile Environment)\"\n\n# --- Determination of BUD ---\n# According to USP <797>, for a single-dose container opened in an ISO Class 5\n# environment, the contents must be used within a specific time frame because\n# it lacks antimicrobial preservatives.\n\nbud_duration_hours = 12\n\n# --- Output the Answer ---\nprint(\"Determining the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) based on USP <797> standards:\")\nprint(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\nprint(f\"Environment: {environment}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(\"The standard states that after the initial puncture or opening, the container must be used within the following timeframe:\")\nprint(f\"BUD = {bud_duration_hours} hours\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(f\"Therefore, the BUD for a single-dose ampule punctured in a sterile environment is 12 hours.\")\n\n```\n<<<12 hours>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
