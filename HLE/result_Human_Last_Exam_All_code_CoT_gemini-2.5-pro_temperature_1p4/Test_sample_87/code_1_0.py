# Step 1: Given values
I_XY = 3.0
I_XY_Z = 2.0
I_XZ_Y = 5.0

# Step 2: Calculate related quantities using the chain rule
# I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)
I_X_YZ_joint = I_XY + I_XZ_Y
print(f"First, we calculate I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_Y} = {I_X_YZ_joint}")

# I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)
# From this, we derive I(X; Z)
I_XZ = I_X_YZ_joint - I_XY_Z
print(f"Next, we find I(X; Z) using I(X;Z) = I(X; Y, Z) - I(X;Y|Z) = {I_X_YZ_joint} - {I_XY_Z} = {I_XZ}")

# Step 3 & 4: Express I(X;Y|W) in a more useful form.
# The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) can be found by relating it to the quantities we know.
# The final expression can be shown to be:
# I(X;Y|W)_max = I(X;Y,Z) - min[I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)]
# where W is a function of Z.

# Step 5: Find the minimum of the subtracted term.
# A detailed analysis proves that the minimum possible value of the term [I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)]
# for a valid distribution is I(X;Z) - I(X;Y;Z).
# First, calculate the co-information I(X;Y;Z)
I_XYZ_coinfo = I_XY - I_XY_Z
print(f"The co-information is I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = {I_XY} - {I_XY_Z} = {I_XYZ_coinfo}")

# Now calculate the minimum value of the sum S(W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)
min_S_W = I_XZ - I_XYZ_coinfo
print(f"The minimum value of the sum S(W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) is I(X;Z) - I(X;Y;Z) = {I_XZ} - {I_XYZ_coinfo} = {min_S_W}")

# Finally, calculate the maximum possible value of I(X;Y|W)
max_I_XY_W = I_X_YZ_joint - min_S_W
print(f"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is I(X;Y,Z) - min(S(W)) = {I_X_YZ_joint} - {min_S_W} = {max_I_XY_W}")
