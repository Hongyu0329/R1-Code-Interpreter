    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the integral:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Integral**: The function `p(x)` is defined piecewise. The definition changes at `x = 3`. To find the integral from `x = 0` to `x = 4`, I will split the integral into two parts:\n    *   The integral of the first function definition from `x = 0` to `x = 3`.\n    *   The integral of the second function definition from `x = 3` to `x = 4`.\n    The total integral will be the sum of these two parts.\n\n2.  **Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3**: In this range, `p(x) = 2x³/8 = x³/4`. The integral is straightforward:\n    ∫(x³/4) dx = x⁴/16.\n    Evaluating this from 0 to 3 gives: (3⁴/16) - (0⁴/16) = 81/16.\n\n3.  **Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4**: In this range, `p(x) = eˣ(1+sin(x))/(1+cos(x))`. This integral fits a special pattern, ∫eˣ(f(x) + f'(x)) dx = eˣf(x).\n    By simplifying the term `(1+sin(x))/(1+cos(x))` to `tan(x/2) + (1/2)sec²(x/2)`, we can see that if `f(x) = tan(x/2)`, then `f'(x) = (1/2)sec²(x/2)`.\n    So, the integral is `[eˣ * tan(x/2)]` evaluated from 3 to 4, which is `e⁴tan(2) - e³tan(1.5)`. Note that trigonometric functions here use radians.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: I will sum the results of Part 1 and Part 2 to get the final answer. The following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates the definite integral of the piecewise function p(x) from x=0 to x=4.\n\n# Part 1: Integral of p(x) = x^3/4 from x = 0 to x = 3\n# The analytical integral is [x^4 / 16].\nintegral_part1 = (3**4 / 16) - (0**4 / 16)\n\n# Part 2: Integral of p(x) = e^x(1+sin(x))/(1+cos(x)) from x = 3 to x = 4\n# The analytical integral is [e^x * tan(x/2)].\n# numpy functions np.exp() and np.tan() work with radians, which is required.\nintegral_part2 = (np.exp(4) * np.tan(2)) - (np.exp(3) * np.tan(1.5))\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values for each part.\n# The format shows each term of the sum explicitly as requested.\nprint(f\"The integral is the sum of two parts:\")\nprint(f\"({integral_part1}) + ({integral_part2}) = {total_integral}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4668233405788>>>"
