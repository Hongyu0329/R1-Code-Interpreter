    This script explains the step-by-step reasoning to determine if the 
    Wasserstein regular subgradient of J(mu) = (1/2) * W(mu, nu)^2 
    is the trivial tangent vector at its minimum.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define the functional and find its minimum ---
    # The functional is J(mu) = (1/2) * W(mu, nu)^2, where W is the Wasserstein-2 distance.
    # W(mu, nu) is a distance, so W(mu, nu) >= 0.
    # The distance is zero if and only if the two measures are identical, i.e., W(mu, nu) = 0 <=> mu = nu.
    # Therefore, the functional J(mu) has a unique minimum at the point mu = nu.
    # At this minimum, the value of the functional is J(nu) = (1/2) * W(nu, nu)^2 = 0.
    
    print("Step 1: The functional J(mu) = (1/2) * W(mu, nu)^2 has a unique minimum at mu = nu.")

    # --- Step 2: Characterize the subdifferential of J(mu) ---
    # In the Wasserstein space, the subdifferential of J at mu, denoted @J(mu), is a set of vector fields.
    # A vector field `v` belongs to @J(mu) if the map T(x) = x - v(x) is an optimal transport map 
    # that pushes mu to nu.
    
    print("Step 2: The subdifferential @J(mu) consists of vector fields `v` where T(x) = x - v(x) is an optimal transport map from mu to nu.")

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the subdifferential at the minimum, @J(nu) ---
    # We apply the characterization at the minimum, where mu = nu.
    # A vector field `v` is in @J(nu) if T(x) = x - v(x) is an optimal transport map from nu to nu.
    # The cost of transporting nu to nu via a map T is integral(|T(x) - x|^2 dnu(x)).
    # The minimum cost is W(nu, nu)^2 = 0.
    # This minimum is achieved only if the integrand is zero for nu-almost every x.
    # So, any optimal transport map T from nu to nu must satisfy T(x) = x (almost everywhere).
    # This means the identity map is the *unique* optimal transport map from nu to itself.
    
    print("Step 3: At the minimum (mu=nu), the only optimal transport map from nu to nu is the identity map, T(x) = x.")

    # --- Step 4: Determine the vector field v ---
    # Since T(x) = x and T(x) = x - v(x), we must have:
    # x = x - v(x)
    # This implies that v(x) = 0 for nu-almost every x.
    # The only vector field in the subdifferential @J(nu) is the zero vector field.
    # So, the subdifferential is the singleton set: @J(nu) = {0}.

    print("Step 4: This implies that the subdifferential at the minimum, @J(nu), contains only the zero vector field: @J(nu) = {0}.")
    
    # --- Step 5: Determine the regular subgradient ---
    # The regular subgradient, @^0 J(mu), is the element of minimal L^2(mu)-norm in @J(mu).
    # Since @J(nu) = {0}, the set contains only one element.
    # The element of minimal norm in a set containing only the zero vector is the zero vector itself.
    # Therefore, the regular subgradient is @^0 J(nu) = {0}.
    # The "trivial tangent vector" is another name for the zero vector in the tangent space.
    
    print("Step 5: The regular subgradient @^0 J(nu) is the element of minimal norm in @J(nu), which is the zero vector.")
    
    # --- Conclusion ---
    # The question asks if the regular subgradient of J at its minimum is the trivial tangent vector.
    # Our derivation shows that @^0 J(nu) = {0}.
    # Thus, the statement is true.

    print("\nConclusion: The statement is true. The regular subgradient is the set containing only the trivial (zero) tangent vector.")
