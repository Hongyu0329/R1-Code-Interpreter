    "Here is my plan to determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein sequences.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Principle**: The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acid residues at specific positions within its repeating seven-residue pattern, known as a heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The 'a' and 'd' positions are most critical as they form the hydrophobic core of the structure.\n2.  **Establish the Heptad Register**: I will assume the standard register where the first residue of each sequence, Glutamic acid (E), is at the 'g' position. This places the second residue at 'a' and the fifth at 'd', which correctly assigns hydrophobic amino acids to the core positions for these sequences.\n3.  **Extract Core Residues**: I will write a Python script to iterate through each sequence and extract the amino acids located at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n4.  **Apply Prediction Rules**: The script will apply a set of well-established rules based on the patterns of these core 'a' and 'd' residues:\n    *   **Tetramer Rule**: A core dominated by Isoleucine (I) at both the 'a' and 'd' positions is a strong indicator of a tetramer (4-mer).\n    *   **Trimer Rule**: A core with Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Threonine (T) at the 'd' position is a classic trimer (3-mer) motif.\n    *   **Dimer Rule (Polar Core)**: The presence of a polar residue like Asparagine (N) at the 'a' position is a hallmark of a parallel dimer (2-mer), where these polar residues form hydrogen bonds within the core.\n    *   **Default to Dimer**: If none of the specific trimer or tetramer motifs are found, the structure is predicted to be a dimer (2-mer). The dimer is the most common coiled-coil state and serves as a robust default prediction for sequences without other strong signals.\n5.  **Generate Final Answer**: The script will process all five sequences, print the prediction and the reasoning for each, and then output the final sequence of oligomeric states.\n\nThis method systematically decodes the information embedded in each sequence to arrive at the correct oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coils(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of coiled-coil sequences to predict their oligomeric state.\n\n    Args:\n        sequences (list): A list of protein sequence strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of predicted integer oligomeric states.\n    \"\"\"\n    final_predictions = []\n    print(\"Analyzing Coiled-Coil Sequences...\\n\")\n\n    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):\n        a_pos = []\n        d_pos = []\n\n        # The heptad repeat is 'abcdefg'.
