    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the specific historical event corresponding to Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam during the Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n2.  Research indicates this occurred in 1424 when Mu Sheng led a relief army from Yunnan to break the siege of the Nghệ An citadel.\n3.  His forces were ambushed and routed by Lê Lợi's army at the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass.\n4.  I will then determine the modern-day Vietnamese province where Khả Lưu Pass is located.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print the name of this province.\n\n```python\ndef find_province_of_defeat():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the modern Vietnamese province\n    where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat during the Lam Son Uprising.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The historical event is the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass in late 1424.\n    # General Mu Sheng's relief army was defeated by Lê Lợi's forces.\n    # This battle took place in the historical region of Nghệ An.\n    province_name = \"Nghệ An\"\n\n    print(f\"The current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat is: {province_name}\")\n\nfind_province_of_defeat()\n```\n<<<Nghệ An>>>"
