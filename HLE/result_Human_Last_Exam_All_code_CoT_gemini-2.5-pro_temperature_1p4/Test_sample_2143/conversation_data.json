    "My plan is to decipher the clues provided in the user's prompt to identify the historical figure being referenced.\n\n1.  **Analyze the core clues:** The prompt refers to a specific interpretation of religious law, mentioning \"another's material possessions\" and a \"prohibition against representation.\" These phrases strongly suggest the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue).\n2.  **\"Prohibition against representation\"**: This directly points to the commandment against making \"any graven image\" or idols.\n3.  **\"Another's material possessions\"**: This points to the commandment against coveting, specifically \"thy neighbor's house... ox... ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.\"\n4.  **Connect the actions to the figure:** The prompt states that \"HE\" ignored the first prohibition (against images) and \"separately addressed\" the second (coveting material possessions). This implies a reordering of the commandments. Historically, there are different numbering systems for the Ten Commandments. The system that subsumes the prohibition of graven images into the first commandment (\"I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt not have strange gods before me\") and splits the final commandment against coveting into two (one against coveting a neighbor's wife, and a separate one against coveting a neighbor's goods/material possessions) is known as the Augustinian tradition.\n5.  **Identify \"HE\"**: This tradition is named after the person who proposed it: the influential theologian and philosopher Augustine of Hippo. His reordering became standard in the Catholic and Lutheran churches. The reference to \"Veronika Campan's interpretation\" serves as a scholarly pointer to this specific exegetical tradition.\n\nTherefore, the person referred to as \"HE\" is Augustine of Hippo. I will now write a simple Python script to print his full name.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    # The historical figure who reordered the Ten Commandments\n    # to combine the prohibition of graven images with the first commandment\n    # and to split the commandment on coveting into two (one for persons, one for material goods)\n    # is Augustine of Hippo.\n    his_full_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(his_full_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
