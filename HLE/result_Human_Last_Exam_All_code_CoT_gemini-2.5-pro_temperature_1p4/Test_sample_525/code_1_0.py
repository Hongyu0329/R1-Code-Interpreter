    Solves the letter sequence puzzle.
    The commonality is that letters have no enclosed loops (e.g., A, B, D, O are excluded).
    Let's test this set: {C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}.
    By working backward, we deduce a sequence of letters.
    The number at pos 8 is 9. The only letter giving 9 is 'I'. So Letter_8 = 'I'.
    The number at pos 7 is 8. The letter must be < 'I' and give 8. Only 'H'. So Letter_7 = 'H'.
    The number at pos 6 is 7. The letter must be < 'H' and give 7. Only 'G'. So Letter_6 = 'G'.
    The number at pos 5 is 5. The letter must be < 'G' and give 5. Only 'E'. So Letter_5 = 'E'.
    The number at pos 4 is 3. The letter must be < 'E' and give 3. Only 'C'. So Letter_4 = 'C'.
    The number at pos 3 is '?'. The letter must be < 'C'.
    This creates a contradiction, as there are no letters in the set before 'C'.
    The likely intended trick is that 'A' is considered to have no loop.
    Let's add 'A' to our set. Now, the letter before 'C' must be 'A'.
    So, Letter_3 is 'A'. Let's find its value.
