    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a specific interval. In quantum mechanics, this is done by integrating the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the Probability Density Function:** For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the wave function is Ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a). The probability density is |Ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a).\n2.  **Set up the Integral:** We need to compute the definite integral of this function from x1 = 0.495a to x2 = 0.505a, with n = 2.\n3.  **Numerical Integration:** The Python script below will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to perform this integration numerically, which is an accurate and efficient method for this kind of problem. The length of the box 'a' will be set to 1 for calculation simplicity, as the final probability is independent of 'a'.\n\nThe script will print the setup of the calculation and the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the constants for the problem.\n# n is the principal quantum number.\nn = 2\n# We can set the length of the box 'a' to 1.0, as the 'a' units cancel out\n# in the final probability calculation, making the result dimensionless.\na = 1.0\n# Define the interval [x1, x2] as a fraction of the box length 'a'.\nx1 = 0.495 * a\nx2 = 0.505 * a\n\n# The probability density function is the square of the normalized wave function.\n# For a particle in a 1D box: |Ψ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a).\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\"\"\"\n    return (2 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# To find the probability of the particle being in the interval [x1, x2],\n# we integrate the probability density function over this interval.\n# The quad function returns the integral result and an estimate of the error.\nprobability, _ = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# --- Output the final equation and the result ---\n\n# Print the parameters of the final equation\nprint(f\"The equation for the probability (P) is the integral of the probability density function |Ψ(x)|².\")\nprint(f\"For n = {n}, the function is (2/a) * sin²({n}*π*x/a).\")\nprint(f\"The integral is evaluated from x₁ = {x1:.3f}a to x₂ = {x2:.3f}a.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"P = ∫ from {x1:.3f} to {x2:.3f} of (2/{a:.1f}) * sin²({n}*π*x/{a:.1f}) dx\")\n\n# Print the final calculated probability\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n<<<6.579736465807185e-06>>>"
