def solve_crystal_model_properties():
    """
    This function calculates the properties of the continuum crystal model.

    Part A: Dimension of π's fibers.
    The connection C represents the local crystal distortion, a 3x3 matrix.
    The space of 3x3 matrices is 9-dimensional.
    So, the dimension of the fiber is 9.

    Part B: Number of coefficients specifying E.
    The energy density E must be a quadratic function of the dislocation density tensor α
    to ensure linear dynamics and detection of dislocations. For a cubic crystal, the
    number of independent coefficients in this quadratic form is the number of
    independent quadratic invariants of a general 2nd-rank tensor under cubic symmetry.
    This number is 4.
