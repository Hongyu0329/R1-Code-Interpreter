    "This is a highly specific question from the mathematical field of continuum theory. I will outline the logical steps to arrive at the answer, and then provide a Python script to print the explanation and the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A nonempty, compact, connected Hausdorff space.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point *x* in a continuum *X*, its composant is the union of all proper subcontinua of *X* that contain *x*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the constraints and properties:**\n    *   For any indecomposable continuum *X*, a composant is always a *proper* subset of *X*. This means if there were only **1** composant, it would have to be equal to *X*, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the number of composants must be greater than 1.\n    *   The phrase \"**not necessarily metric**\" is crucial. For *metric* indecomposable continua (like those that can be drawn in the plane), a famous result based on the Baire Category Theorem shows they must have uncountably many composants.\n    *   However, for *non-metric* continua, this result does not necessarily hold. The argument fails because we cannot guarantee that the space is separable.\n    *   Mathematicians have constructed non-metric indecomposable continua using methods like transfinite induction. These constructions show that it is possible to have a continuum with a finite number of composants.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since the number of composants must be greater than 1, the smallest possible integer value is 2.\n    *   It has been proven that such a non-metric continuum with exactly **2** composants can be constructed.\n\n4.  **Python Code:**\n    *   The Python script will print this reasoning and the final numerical answer, satisfying the request to \"output each number\".\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and provides the answer to the question about the smallest\n    number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
