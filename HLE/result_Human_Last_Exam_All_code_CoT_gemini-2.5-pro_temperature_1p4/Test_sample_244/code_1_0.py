    # Step 1: Find the total number of distinct knot types with 7 crossings.
    # From knot theory catalogs (e.g., Rolfsen's table), there are 7
    # distinct prime knots with 7 crossings, ignoring mirror images.
    # They are denoted 7_1, 7_2, 7_3, 7_4, 7_5, 7_6, and 7_7.
    total_knots = 7

    # Step 2 & 3: Identify which of these knots are not hyperbolic.
    # A prime knot is hyperbolic if and only if it is not a torus knot.
    # We need to find how many of the 7-crossing knots are torus knots.
    # A torus knot T(p,q) has crossing number c = min(p(q-1), q(p-1)).
    # We need to find coprime integers p > q >= 2 such that c = 7.
    # Let's check possible values for q:
    # If q = 2, we need p to be coprime to 2. The crossing number is p. So c = p = 7.
    # The pair (7,2) are coprime. Thus, the T(7,2) torus knot has 7 crossings.
    # This knot corresponds to the knot 7_1 in the standard catalog.
    # If q = 3, we need p to be coprime to 3. The crossing number is 2p. 2p = 7 has no integer solution for p.
    # No other pairs (p,q) yield a crossing number of 7.
    # Therefore, there is only one torus knot with 7 crossings.
    torus_knots = 1

    # Step 4: Calculate the number of hyperbolic knots.
    hyperbolic_knots = total_knots - torus_knots

    # Step 5: Calculate and print the proportion.
    # The proportion is the number of hyperbolic knots divided by the total number of knots.
