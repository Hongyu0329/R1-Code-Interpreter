    This problem asks for the number of initial sets S for which it is impossible to make all elements zero.
    
    Let's analyze the properties of the set S under the given operation.
    Let Σ be the sum of the elements in S, and let o be the number of odd elements in S.
    The operation is to replace two elements x and y with x+y and -x-y.

    The new sum Σ' is Σ - (x+y).
    The parity of the sum changes if and only if x+y is odd, which happens if one of x,y is odd and the other is even.

    The number of odd elements o also changes.
    - If x, y are same parity, x+y is even.
        - If x,y are both odd, o becomes o-2.
        - If x,y are both even, o does not change.
      In both cases, the parity of o is unchanged.
    - If x, y are of different parity, x+y is odd. o becomes o-1+2 = o+1.
      In this case, the parity of o flips.
    
    Let's define an invariant. Let I(S) = (Σ + o) mod 2.
    - If x, y have same parity: Σ' ≡ Σ (mod 2), o' ≡ o (mod 2). So I(S') = I(S).
    - If x, y have different parity: Σ' ≡ Σ - 1 (mod 2), o' = o + 1. So I(S') = (Σ-1 + o+1) mod 2 = I(S).
    So, (Σ + o) mod 2 is an invariant.

    The final state S_n is all zeroes. For S_n, Σ_n = 0 and o_n = 0. So, I(S_n) = (0+0) mod 2 = 0.
    For any initial state S_0 to be able to reach the all-zero state, we must have I(S_0) = 0.
    I(S_0) = (Σ_0 + o_0) mod 2 = 0.
    
    However, for any set of integers S, there is an identity: Σ mod 2 = o mod 2.
    Proof: Σ mod 2 = (Σ (s mod 2)) mod 2. (s mod 2) is 1 for odd s and 0 for even s.
    So Σ (s mod 2) is the number of odd elements, o. Thus, Σ mod 2 = o mod 2.
    
    This identity means that for any set S, I(S) = (o + o) mod 2 = 0.
    The invariant is always 0 for any possible initial set. This means the invariant gives no information about which sets are impossible.

    A more powerful argument shows that it is always possible. We can devise a strategy that systematically increases the 2-adic valuation (the power of 2 dividing each number) of all non-zero numbers in the set. Given enough operations, we can make this valuation arbitrarily large, which implies all numbers must become 0. With n operations for an n-element set, it turns out to be sufficient.
    
    Therefore, there are no initial sets for which it is impossible. The number of such sets is 0.
