    "Here is the step-by-step plan to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners:\n\n1.  **Define the Triple Crown:** The Triple Crown in baseball is awarded to a batter who leads their league in three specific offensive categories in the same season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n\n2.  **Gather the Data:** I will compile lists of all players who have achieved this feat. This includes winners from the American League (AL), the National League (NL), and the Negro Leagues (NeL), whose statistics are now officially recognized by Major League Baseball.\n\n3.  **Structure the Code:**\n    *   Create three separate lists in Python to hold the winners from the AL, NL, and NeL. Each entry will contain the player's name and the year they won.\n    *   Calculate the number of wins for each league by getting the length of each list.\n    *   Sum the counts from all three leagues to find the total number of Triple Crown wins in MLB history.\n\n4.  **Format the Output:**\n    *   The code will first print the list of winners, clearly separated by league.\n    *   Finally, it will display the total count as an equation, showing how the numbers from each league add up to the grand total, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script lists the MLB Triple Crown winners and calculates the total number.\n    The data includes winners from the American League, National League, and Negro Leagues,\n    whose statistics are now officially recognized by MLB.\n    \"\"\"\n    al_winners = [\n        {\"player\": \"Nap Lajoie\", \"year\": 1901},\n        {\"player\": \"Ty Cobb\", \"year\": 1909},\n        {\"player\": \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Lou Gehrig\", \"year\": 1934},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1942},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1947},\n        {\"player\": \"Mickey Mantle\", \"year\": 1956},\n        {\"player\": \"Frank Robinson\", \"year\": 1966},\n        {\"player\": \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"year\": 1967},\n        {\"player\": \"Miguel Cabrera\", \"year\": 2012},\n        {\"player\": \"Aaron Judge\", \"year\": 2022}\n    ]\n\n    nl_winners = [\n        {\"player\": \"Heinie Zimmerman\", \"year\": 1912},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1922},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1925},\n        {\"player\": \"Chuck Klein\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Joe Medwick\", \"year\": 1937}\n    ]\n    \n    nel_winners = [\n        {\"player\": \"Oscar Charleston\", \"year\": 1921},\n        {\"player\": \"Turkey Stearnes\", \"year\": 1928},\n        {\"player\": \"Josh Gibson\", \"year\": 1936},\n        {\"player\": \"Josh Gibson\", \"year\": 1937},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Strong\", \"year\": 1939},\n        {\"player\": \"Lennie Pearson\", \"year\": 1940},\n        {\"player\": \"Wild Bill Wright\", \"year\": 1940},\n        {\"player\": \"Artie Wilson\", \"year\": 1948}\n    ]\n\n    print(\"--- MLB Triple Crown Winners ---\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAmerican League Winners:\")\n    for winner in al_winners:\n        print(f\"- {winner['player']} ({winner['year']})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nNational League Winners:\")\n    for winner in nl_winners:\n        print(f\"- {winner['player']} ({winner['year']})\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nNegro Leagues Winners:\")\n    for winner in nel_winners:\n        print(f\"- {winner['player']} ({winner['year']})\")\n\n    num_al_winners = len(al_winners)\n    num_nl_winners = len(nl_winners)\n    num_nel_winners = len(nel_winners)\n    total_winners = num_al_winners + num_nl_winners + num_nel_winners\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Total Number of Triple Crown Winners ---\")\n    print(f\"American League Wins: {num_al_winners}\")\n    print(f\"National League Wins: {num_nl_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Negro Leagues Wins: {num_nel_winners}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {num_al_winners} + {num_nl_winners} + {num_nel_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n\nfind_triple_crown_winners()\n<<<24>>>\n```"
