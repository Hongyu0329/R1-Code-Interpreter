    print("  - Phenotype Component 2 (Growth): Persistent short stature (10th-15th percentile).")
    print("  - Phenotype Component 3 (Cardiovascular): Fatigue, shortness of breath during activity, and elevated blood pressure.")
    print("\nStep 2: Forming an initial differential diagnosis based on the phenotype.")
    print("  - The constellation of short stature, ovarian failure, and cardiovascular signs is highly characteristic of Turner Syndrome.")
    print("\nStep 3: Integrating the pivotal genetic test result.")
    print("  - A crucial piece of information is the 'normal chromosomal complement,' indicating a 46,XX karyotype.")
    print("  - This result effectively rules out classic Turner Syndrome, which is defined by a 45,X karyotype.")
    print("\nStep 4: Evaluating alternative diagnoses that mimic Turner Syndrome.")
    print("  - The search shifts to single-gene disorders (molecular abnormalities) that can produce a 'Turner-like' phenotype in individuals with a normal karyotype.")
    print("  - While mutations in genes like SHOX (causing short stature) or BMP15 (causing ovarian failure) can explain parts of the phenotype, they do not account for the full set of symptoms.")
    print("\nStep 5: Identifying the most probable unifying diagnosis.")
    print("  - Noonan Syndrome is a well-known genetic disorder that significantly overlaps with Turner Syndrome.")
    print("  - Core features of Noonan Syndrome include short stature and congenital heart disease (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which would explain the patient's cardiac symptoms).")
    print("  - While primary ovarian dysgenesis is less common in Noonan Syndrome than delayed puberty, it is a recognized association.")
    print("  - Therefore, Noonan Syndrome is the most likely diagnosis that explains the patient's multi-system issues in the presence of a normal karyotype.")
    print("\nStep 6: Concluding the likely molecular abnormality.")
    print("  - The most frequent cause of Noonan Syndrome, accounting for approximately 50% of cases, is a gain-of-function mutation in the PTPN11 gene.")
