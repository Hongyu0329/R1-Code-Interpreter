# Given surface area of the Riemannian two-sphere
area = 8.0

# According to the Croke-Rotman inequality, the length L of at least one
# simple closed geodesic on a sphere of area A is bounded by:
# L <= 2 * sqrt(3) * sqrt(A)
# This is the best known general bound as of 2024.

# Constants from the formula
coefficient = 2
constant_sqrt_val = 3

# Calculate the square root of the area
sqrt_area = math.sqrt(area)

# Calculate the upper bound
upper_bound = coefficient * math.sqrt(constant_sqrt_val) * sqrt_area

# For clarity in the final output, we can simplify the expression:
# 2 * sqrt(3) * sqrt(8) = 2 * sqrt(3) * 2 * sqrt(2) = 4 * sqrt(6)
