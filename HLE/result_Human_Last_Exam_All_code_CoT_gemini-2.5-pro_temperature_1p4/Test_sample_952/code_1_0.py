    Solves the diamond arrangement puzzle.

    The problem asks for the largest integer k such that for any valid arrangement
    of k diamonds on a 2024x2024 grid, at least one diamond is "mobile".

    Let N = 2024. The grid is N x N.
    A diamond arrangement is a set of cells S, which is an independent set on the
    grid graph (no two diamonds are in adjacent cells).

    A diamond at cell d ∈ S is mobile if it can be moved to an adjacent empty
    cell c, and the new arrangement S' = (S \ {d}) ∪ {c} is still an
    independent set. This means c must not be adjacent to any diamond in S \ {d}.

    A configuration S is "fully stuck" if no diamond in S is mobile.

    The problem asks for the largest k such that NO arrangement of size k is
    fully stuck. This is equivalent to finding the minimum size of a fully stuck
    arrangement, M_stuck, and the answer will be k = M_stuck - 1.

    Consider the checkerboard coloring of the grid. Any valid arrangement (independent set)
    can have diamonds only on cells of the same color. The largest independent sets
    are the set of all black cells (B) or all white cells (W).
    |B| = |W| = (N*N) / 2.

    Let's consider the arrangement S = B (all black cells have diamonds).
    Any diamond d in B is surrounded by white neighbors. Let c be a white neighbor of d.
    For d to move to c, c's other neighbors must not have diamonds. But all neighbors of
    a white cell are black, and in S=B, they all have diamonds. So no diamond can move.
    Therefore, S=B is a fully stuck arrangement. Its size is (N*N)/2.

    Now, let's try to find a smaller stuck arrangement.
    Consider S' = B \ {d_removed}, where d_removed is a single black cell.
    A diamond d in S' is mobile if it can move to a white neighbor c, which requires that
    the other neighbors of c, N(c)\{d}, do not contain any diamonds from S'.
    This means N(c)\{d} must be a subset of {d_removed}. For this to hold, we need
    |N(c)|, the number of neighbors of the white cell c, to be small.

    The only white cells with 2 neighbors are the corners (1, N) and (N, 1) (assuming
    (1,1) is black, which it is since 1+1=2 is even).
    Let's check the white corner c=(1,N). Its neighbors are the black cells d1=(1,N-1) and d2=(2,N).
    For the diamond at d1 to become mobile (i.e., move to c), the cell d2 must be empty.
    This means we must have chosen d_removed = d2.
    Symmetrically, if we remove d1, the diamond at d2 becomes mobile.

    However, if we remove a black cell that is NOT one of these four special cells
    adjacent to the white corners (i.e., (1,N-1), (2,N), (N-1,1), (N,2)), then no
    new mobility is created. For example, removing the black corner cell d_removed = (1,1).
    The resulting set S' = B \ {(1,1)} is still fully stuck.
    The size of this stuck arrangement is |B| - 1 = (N*N)/2 - 1.

    This seems to be the minimum possible size for a stuck arrangement.
    Therefore, M_stuck = (N*N)/2 - 1.
    The value k we are looking for is M_stuck - 1.
    k = (N*N)/2 - 2.
