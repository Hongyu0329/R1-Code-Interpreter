# The user wants to find the smallest possible number of fixed points for a function f.
#
# The function f has the following properties:
# 1. f is a continuous function from the real numbers to the real numbers.
# 2. There exists a constant 'a' such that a <= 1.
# 3. For all distinct real numbers x and y, |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y|.
#
# A fixed point is a value 'x' for which f(x) = x.

# Step 1: Analyze the condition on 'a'.
# The left-hand side, |f(x) - f(y)|, is always non-negative. For the strict inequality to hold,
# the right-hand side, a|x - y|, must be positive (since x is not equal to y).
# This implies that the constant 'a' must be positive.
# So, the condition on 'a' is 0 < a <= 1.

# Step 2: Simplify the inequality.
# Since 0 < a <= 1, if the condition |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| holds,
# then a weaker but sufficient condition also holds:
# |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 * |x - y|, which simplifies to |f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y|.
# We will now prove that any function satisfying this weaker condition has exactly one fixed point.

# Step 3: Define a helper function to find fixed points.
# A fixed point exists where f(x) = x. This is equivalent to f(x) - x = 0.
# Let's define a new function g(x) = f(x) - x.
# The fixed points of f are the roots of g(x). Since f(x) and x are continuous, g(x) is also continuous.

# Step 4: Prove there is at most one fixed point (uniqueness).
# We can show that g(x) is strictly decreasing. Let's take any two points y > x.
# g(y) - g(x) = (f(y) - y) - (f(x) - x) = (f(y) - f(x)) - (y - x).
# From our condition |f(y) - f(x)| < |y - x|, and since y > x, we have -(y - x) < f(y) - f(x) < y - x.
# The right part of this inequality is f(y) - f(x) < y - x.
# Substituting this into the expression for g(y) - g(x):
# g(y) - g(x) < (y - x) - (y - x) = 0.
# So, for any y > x, we have g(y) < g(x). This means g(x) is a strictly decreasing function.
# A strictly decreasing function can only cross the x-axis (g(x)=0) at most once.
# Therefore, there can be at most one fixed point.

# Step 5: Prove there is at least one fixed point (existence).
# We can use the Intermediate Value Theorem if we can show that g(x) takes on both positive and negative values.
# Let's examine the limits of g(x) as x approaches infinity.
# From the condition, |f(x) - f(0)| < |x|. This means f(0) - |x| < f(x) < f(0) + |x|.
# For g(x) = f(x) - x, we have the upper bound: g(x) < (f(0) + |x|) - x.
# As x -> -infinity, |x| = -x. So, g(x) < f(0) - x - x = f(0) - 2x.
# Since f(0) - 2x -> +infinity as x -> -infinity, g(x) must also go to +infinity. Thus, g(x) takes positive values.
# We also have the lower bound: g(x) > (f(0) - |x|) - x.
# As x -> +infinity, |x| = x. So, g(x) > f(0) - x - x = f(0) - 2x.
# Since f(0) - 2x -> -infinity as x -> +infinity, g(x) must also go to -infinity. Thus, g(x) takes negative values.
# Since g(x) is continuous and its range spans from +infinity to -infinity, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees
# that there must be at least one value 'p' for which g(p) = 0.
# Therefore, there is at least one fixed point.

# Step 6: Conclusion.
# From steps 4 and 5, we conclude that there is at most one fixed point and at least one fixed point.
# This means for any function f that satisfies the given conditions, there is exactly one fixed point.
# The set of possible numbers of fixed points is {1}.
# Therefore, the smallest possible number of fixed points is 1.
