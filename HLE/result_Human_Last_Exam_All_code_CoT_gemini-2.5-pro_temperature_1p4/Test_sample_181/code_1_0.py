    This function calculates the value of foo(7) based on mathematical principles
    as the original code is computationally infeasible.

    The function foo(n) counts the number of group structures on a set of n elements.
    For n=7, which is a prime number, there is only one group structure up to
    isomorphism: the cyclic group C_7.

    The number of distinct group tables on n elements for a given group G is
    n! / |Aut(G)|, where |Aut(G)| is the size of the automorphism group of G.

    - n = 7
