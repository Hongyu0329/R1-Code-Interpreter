# The central problem in the question is what challenges predictive models of genetic drift.
# Genetic drift is a neutral process, meaning changes are due to random chance, not selection.
# Therefore, the biggest challenge to a drift model is evidence of a strong non-neutral process.

# Let's model this concept.

# Let's assume a model based on genetic drift predicts a certain rate of nonsynonymous substitutions for a gene.
# This represents the changes expected to occur by random chance alone.
drift_prediction_rate = 0.05  # e.g., 5 changes per million years predicted by drift

# However, when we observe the actual gene, we find the rate is much higher.
observed_rate = 0.20  # e.g., 20 changes per million years are actually observed

# The discrepancy suggests another force is at play. Adaptive evolution (positive selection)
# actively favors new beneficial mutations, increasing their frequency far beyond what random chance would allow.
# If the observed rate is higher than the drift prediction, we can infer the effect of adaptation.
if observed_rate > drift_prediction_rate:
    adaptive_evolution_effect = observed_rate - drift_prediction_rate

    print("This scenario illustrates a key challenge to genetic drift models:")
    print("The model's predictive power is challenged when observed phenomena cannot be explained by random chance alone.")
    print("\nHere, the observed rate of change is significantly higher than what drift predicts.")
    print("This suggests a non-neutral force, like adaptive evolution, is a major driver.")
