    print("\nStep 1: Establishing a lower bound")
    print("The set S = {u_1, u_2, ...} is an infinite set of points in the Stone-Cech remainder N*.")
    print("The space N* is compact. A fundamental result in topology states that any infinite subset of a compact space must have at least one accumulation point.")
    print("Therefore, the number of accumulation points must be at least 1.")

    print("\nStep 2: Proving the lower bound can be achieved")
    print("We need to show that a configuration with exactly one accumulation point is possible.")
    print("This can be achieved by constructing a sequence of ultrafilters (u_i) that converges to a single ultrafilter, q.")

    print("It is a known (though non-trivial) result in set theory that such ultrafilters and partitions exist. These are provable within the standard ZFC axioms.")
    print("An ultrafilter q for which such a partition {P_i} exists is sometimes called an 'OK point'.")
    
    # Step 5: Conclusion
    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("By choosing an OK point q and its associated partition {P_i}, we can construct a sequence of ultrafilters (u_i) that satisfies the problem's constraints and converges to q.")
    print("This means a scenario with exactly one accumulation point is possible.")
    
    # Final answer
    print("\nSince the number of accumulation points is at least 1, and we have shown it can be exactly 1, the smallest possible number is 1.")
