  This function determines the value of n for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.
  
  Based on the analysis of the representation theory of posets, a "tame functor"
  is interpreted as a regular indecomposable module over the incidence algebra K[J],
  where J is an upper semilattice of tame-infinite representation type.
  
  Key examples of such structures (like those associated with Euclidean quivers) lead to
  hereditary algebras of global dimension 1. For a hereditary algebra, any module
  has a projective dimension of at most 1. This means any functor is 1-resolvable.
  
  Thus, n = 1.
