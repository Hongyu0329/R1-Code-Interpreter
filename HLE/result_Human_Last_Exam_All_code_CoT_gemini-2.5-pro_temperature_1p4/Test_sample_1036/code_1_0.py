# This script calculates the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
# that have distinct remainders when divided by k, for each k in {2, 3, ..., 100}.
# As explained in the steps above, the problem reduces to counting the number of
# valid sequences of remainders, which is determined by a series of binary choices.

# The number of choices for the sequence of remainders is 2^99.
# We set the base and exponent for the calculation.
base = 2
exponent = 99

# Calculate the result.
result = base**exponent

# Output the equation and the final answer.
print(f"The final equation is: {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"The number of such positive integers is: {result}")
