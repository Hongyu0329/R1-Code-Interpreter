    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`, and the spin angular momentum quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number `j` results from the coupling of `l` and `s`. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n    *   `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n    *   `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n    *   Therefore, the possible values for `j` are `1/2` and `3/2`.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues for Each `j` Manifold:**\n    *   The operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ have common eigenstates, denoted as `|j, m_j>`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $J_z$ is given by the formula $\\hbar m_j$.\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   Define `l` and `s`.\n    *   Calculate the possible `j` values.\n    *   Loop through each `j` value.\n    *   For each `j`, calculate the single $J^2$ eigenvalue for that manifold.\n    *   Inside the loop, iterate through all possible `m_j` values for the current `j`.\n    *   For each `m_j`, calculate the corresponding $J_z$ eigenvalue.\n    *   Print the results for each state `|j, m_j>`, showing the explicit numbers used in the eigenvalue equations. Using the `fractions` module will help present the half-integer values clearly.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    The eigenvalues of J^2 are hbar^2 * j*(j+1) and for J_z are hbar * m_j.\n    This script calculates the numerical factors j*(j+1) and m_j.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 1\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, spin quantum number s = 1/2\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l={l} and s={s}:\\n\")\n\n    # The total angular momentum quantum number j can take values from |l-s| to l+s\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n\n    # Generate the list of possible j values\n    j_values = []\n    current_j = j_min\n    while current_j <= j_max:\n        j_values.append(current_j)\n        current_j += 1\n\n    # Store results for the final answer\n    eigenvalue_pairs = []\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j manifold\n    for j in j_values:\n        j_frac = fractions.Fraction(j).limit_denominator()\n        print(f\"--- For the j = {j_frac} manifold ---\")\n\n        # The eigenvalue of J^2 is hbar^2 * j * (j + 1)\n        j_squared_eigenvalue_factor = j * (j + 1)\n        j2_frac = fractions.Fraction(j_squared_eigenvalue_factor).limit_denominator()\n\n        # The magnetic quantum number m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps\n        m_j_values = []\n        current_m_j = -j\n        while current_m_j <= j:\n            m_j_values.append(current_m_j)\n            current_m_j += 1\n\n        print(f\"The J^2 eigenvalue is constant for this manifold: {j2_frac} * hbar^2\")\n        print(\"The corresponding J_z eigenvalues are:\")\n        \n        # For each m_j, the J_z eigenvalue is hbar * m_j\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            mj_frac = fractions.Fraction(m_j).limit_denominator()\n            \n            # Add to result list\n            eigenvalue_pairs.append(((str(j2_frac)), str(mj_frac)))\n\n            print(f\"  For the state |j={j_frac}, m_j={mj_frac}>:\")\n            # Output each number in the final equation per user request\n            print(f\"    Eigenvalue of J^2 = ({j_frac}) * ({j_frac} + 1) * hbar^2 = {j2_frac} * hbar^2\")\n            print(f\"    Eigenvalue of J_z = {mj_frac} * hbar\")\n        print() # Add a newline for better separation\n    \n    # This part is for the final answer block and will not be printed to console\n    final_answer_str = \"The pairs of eigenvalues (for J^2, for J_z) in units of hbar^2 and hbar respectively are: \"\n    final_answer_str += \", \".join([f\"({p[0]}, {p[1]})\" for p in eigenvalue_pairs])\n    return final_answer_str\n\n# Execute the function and print the results\nfinal_answer = solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n# The final answer is wrapped for the platform, but the script itself produces the detailed output.\n# print(f\"\\n<<<final_answer>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<The pairs of eigenvalues (for J^2, for J_z) in units of hbar^2 and hbar respectively are: (15/4, -3/2), (15/4, -1/2), (15/4, 1/2), (15/4, 3/2), (3/4, -1/2), (3/4, 1/2)>>>"
