    "This is a classic problem in the geometry of numbers. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it.\n\n### My plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the condition**: The convex domain `K` must intersect every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. The set of these lines is symmetric with respect to the origin, because if `(p,q)` is a coprime pair, so is `(-p,-q)`, which defines the line `px+qy = -1`. This means the range of values `px+qy` for points `(x,y)` in `K` must contain `[-1, 1]` for any coprime `(p,q)`.\n2.  **Symmetrize the domain**: Consider the Minkowski sum `K_s = (K - K)/2`. This new set `K_s` is convex and centrally symmetric about the origin. Its area is less than or equal to the area of `K`. The condition on `K` implies a simpler condition on `K_s`: its support function `h_{K_s}(p,q)` must be at least 1 for all coprime `(p,q)`. This allows us to focus on finding the minimum area for a centrally symmetric convex domain.\n3.  **Use duality**: For a centrally symmetric convex set `K_s`, the condition `h_{K_s}(p,q) >= 1` is equivalent to saying that the polar body `(K_s)*` does not contain any primitive integer lattice points `(p,q)` in its interior.\n4.  **Apply Minkowski's theorem**: According to Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies, a centrally symmetric convex set in the plane with an area greater than 4 must contain a non-zero integer lattice point in its interior. It can be further shown that it must contain a primitive one. Therefore, the area of our polar body `(K_s)*` must be less than or equal to 4.\n5.  **Apply the Blaschke-Santaló inequality**: This inequality relates the area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K_s` to the area of its polar `(K_s)*`. In the plane, it states that `Area(K_s) * Area((K_s)*) >= 8`.\n6.  **Combine results**: From `Area(K_s) * Area((K_s)*) >= 8` and `Area((K_s)*) <= 4`, we can deduce that `Area(K_s) >= 8 / Area((K_s)*) >= 8 / 4 = 2`. So, the minimal area is at least 2.\n7.  **Find a domain that achieves this minimum**: The minimum of 2 is achieved if we can find a domain that satisfies the equality conditions. This occurs if `Area((K_s)*) = 4` and the body is a parallelogram. The square `[-1, 1] x [-1, 1]` is a valid choice for `(K_s)*`: its area is 4, and its interior `(-1,1)x(-1,1)` contains no primitive integer points. The polar of this square is the domain `K_s` defined by `|x| + |y| <= 1`. This is also a square, with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. Its area is 2, achieving the bound.\n\nThis confirms that the minimal area is 2. The following python code will demonstrate the calculation of the area for the optimal shape.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the minimal area of a convex domain that\n# intersects all lines of the form px + qy = 1 for coprime integers p, q.\n#\n# As derived from principles of convex geometry (Minkowski's Theorem, Blaschke-Santaló inequality),\n# the minimal area is 2. This area is achieved by a specific convex domain.\n\n# The optimal domain K is a square defined by the inequality |x| + |y| <= 1.\n# The vertices of this square are at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).\n\n# We can calculate the area of this square using the formula Area = 1/2 * d1 * d2,\n# where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n# The first diagonal connects (-1, 0) and (1, 0). Its length is 2.\n# The second diagonal connects (0, -1) and (0, 1). Its length is also 2.\nd1 = 2\nd2 = 2\n\n# The equation for the area of the optimal domain is:\n# Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2\narea = (1/2) * d1 * d2\n\nprint(\"The minimal area is achieved by the convex domain defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\")\nprint(\"This domain is a square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\")\nprint(\"The final equation for calculating this area using its diagonals d1 and d2 is:\")\n# Outputting each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"Area = (1 / {d1}) * {d1} * {d2} = {area}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
