# The problem is to find the minimal area of a convex domain that
# intersects all lines of the form px + qy = 1 for coprime integers p, q.
#
# As derived from principles of convex geometry (Minkowski's Theorem, Blaschke-Santal√≥ inequality),
# the minimal area is 2. This area is achieved by a specific convex domain.

# The optimal domain K is a square defined by the inequality |x| + |y| <= 1.
# The vertices of this square are at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).

# We can calculate the area of this square using the formula Area = 1/2 * d1 * d2,
# where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.
# The first diagonal connects (-1, 0) and (1, 0). Its length is 2.
# The second diagonal connects (0, -1) and (0, 1). Its length is also 2.
d1 = 2
d2 = 2

# The equation for the area of the optimal domain is:
# Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2
area = (1/2) * d1 * d2
