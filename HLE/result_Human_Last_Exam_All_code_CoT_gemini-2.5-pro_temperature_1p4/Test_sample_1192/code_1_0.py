    # Clinical Analysis
    # The patient's vital signs are stable.
    # The key factor is the recent heart valve surgery.
    # Patients with artificial heart valves are at high risk for developing blood clots (thrombi) on the valve.
    # A dislodged clot (embolus) can travel to the brain and cause a stroke, a severe adverse event.
    # Prophylactic (preventive) therapy is required to mitigate this risk.
    
    # Evaluating the most critical preventative measure:
    # The most direct and essential action to prevent clot formation is prescribing an anticoagulant medication.
    # Other options like physical therapy, diet, and exercise are important for long-term recovery
    # but do not address the immediate, life-threatening risk of a thrombotic event.
