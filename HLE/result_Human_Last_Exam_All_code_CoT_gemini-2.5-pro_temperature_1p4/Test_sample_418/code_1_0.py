def solve_equivalence_classes():
    """
    Calculates the number of equivalence classes for the given topological space X.

    The space X is a disjoint union of five components.
    The equivalence relation is defined by the action of auto-homeomorphisms.

    Step 1: Note that any auto-homeomorphism of X must map each of the five
    components to itself, since no two components are homeomorphic to each other.

    Step 2: This means we can find the number of equivalence classes within each
    component separately and then sum them up.

    Step 3: For each component, we check if it is a "homogeneous space". A space
    is homogeneous if for any two points x and y, there is an auto-homeomorphism
    that maps x to y. A homogeneous space has exactly one equivalence class.
