    "To solve this problem, I will first compile a list of prominent historical mountains mentioned in Homer's Iliad. Then, I will find the official elevation of each of these mountains. Finally, I will write a Python script to compare these elevations, excluding Mount Olympus, and identify the tallest one. The script will then print the name and elevation of the highest mountain from the remaining list.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Olympus is included for context but will be excluded from the search.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Olympus\": 2918,\n        \"Mount Ida (Crete)\": 2456,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida (Troy)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n    }\n\n    # Remove Mount Olympus from our consideration as per the user's request.\n    mountains_without_olympus = {name: elev for name, elev in mountains.items() if name != \"Mount Olympus\"}\n\n    # Find the tallest mountain among the remaining ones.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains_without_olympus, key=mountains_without_olympus.get)\n    tallest_mountain_elevation = mountains_without_olympus[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(f\"After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Its elevation is {tallest_mountain_elevation} meters.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
