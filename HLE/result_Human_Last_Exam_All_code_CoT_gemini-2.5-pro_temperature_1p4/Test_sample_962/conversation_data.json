    "Of course. Designing a cryptographic protocol is a complex task that involves deep mathematical principles to ensure security. A `t-out-of-n` threshold signature scheme allows any `t` members of a group of `n` to collectively sign a message, but no group of `t-1` or fewer can. A two-round protocol is highly efficient in terms of communication overhead.\n\nHere is a plan for how to design such a scheme, followed by a Python code simulation that demonstrates the core logic.\n\n### Design Plan\n\nThe design combines two key cryptographic concepts:\n\n1.  **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS):** We first need a way to distribute the master secret signing key. SSS is perfect for this. We define a random polynomial of degree `t-1`, where the constant term is our master secret key `s`. Each of the `n` parties is given a point on this polynomial as their secret share `s_i`. The magic of SSS is that with `t` shares (points), you can reconstruct the polynomial and find the master secret `s`, but with `t-1` shares, you can learn nothing about `s`.\n\n2.  **A Two-Round Schnorr-like Protocol:** To sign, the `t` participating parties need to interact. We use a two-round protocol to ensure that no party can be improperly influenced by another's choices.\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` signers generates a secret random number (a \"nonce\") and broadcasts a public commitment to it. This commits them to their contribution before seeing anyone else's.\n    *   **Round 2 (Response):** After all commitments are shared, a common \"challenge\" value is computed based on the commitments and the message. Each signer then uses their secret share `s_i`, their private nonce from round 1, and the challenge to compute a partial signature.\n\nFinally, an aggregator combines the `t` partial signatures into a single signature that can be verified by anyone using the master public key. This combination step uses Lagrange coefficients to properly weight each party's contribution, allowing the reconstruction of the final signature.\n\n**Note on Security:** The following Python code simulates the logical flow of such a scheme. A real-world, \"tightly secure\" implementation requires using elliptic curve cryptography instead of simple modular arithmetic, secure hash functions, and additional cryptographic techniques to prevent sophisticated attacks, which are omitted here for clarity.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\ndef design_threshold_signature_scheme(t, n, message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n\n    Args:\n        t (int): The threshold of signers required.\n        n (int): The total number of parties in the scheme.\n        message (str): The message to be signed.\n    \"\"\"\n    if t > n:\n        print(\"Threshold t cannot be greater than the number of parties n.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Designing a {t}-out-of-{n} threshold signature scheme.\\n\")\n\n    # --- 1.
