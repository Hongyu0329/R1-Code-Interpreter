    "When a quantum dimension is introduced to the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the game's structure can change based on the initial state of the system and the strategies available to the players. I will model this scenario using the widely adopted Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Set up the game with a maximally entangled initial state, which is achieved via an entangling operator `J`.\n2.  Define the players' strategies as quantum operations (unitary matrices). The key strategies are a \"Cooperate\" move `C`, a \"Defect\" move `D'`, and a special quantum strategy `Q` known as the \"miracle move\".\n3.  The problem states that players will \"pick the best strategy.\" This implies they will search for a strategy that maximizes their payoff, given the other player's move. This is the definition of a Nash Equilibrium.\n4.  First, I will calculate the payoff if both players choose the cooperative quantum strategy `Q`. This results in the optimal payoff `(5, 5)`, equivalent to mutual cooperation.\n5.  Next, I will check if this `(Q, Q)` outcome is a stable Nash Equilibrium. I will demonstrate that a player can unilaterally switch to a different quantum strategy, `D'`, to receive a higher \"Temptation\" payoff of 7.\n6.  This means that `(Q, Q)` is not the equilibrium. The rational choice is to play `D'`. The unique Nash Equilibrium is when both players choose this defecting strategy, `(D', D')`.\n7.  The Python code below will simulate this game, calculate the payoffs for the `(D', D')` equilibrium, and print out the final payoff calculation, showing each number involved. The equilibrium point is the payoff received by the players at this stable equilibrium.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma to find the equilibrium point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the payoff matrix from the problem description\n    #         Player 2\n    #         Cooperate (C)   Defect (D)\n    # P1 C      (R, R)          (S, T)\n    #    D      (T, S)          (P, P)\n    R = 5  # Reward for mutual cooperation\n    S = 0  # Sucker's payoff\n    T = 7  # Temptation to defect\n    P = 1  # Punishment for mutual defection\n    payoffs = {'R': R, 'S': S, 'T': T, 'P': P}\n\n    # Step 2: Define the quantum mechanical setup\n    # Basis vectors for the two-qubit system\n    ket00 = np.array([[1], [0], [0], [0]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Entangling operator J for maximal entanglement\n    I2 = np.identity(2, dtype=complex)\n    sx = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    J = (1 / np.sqrt(2)) * (np.kron(I2, I2) + 1j * np.kron(sx, sx))\n\n    # Step 3: Define player strategies as unitary operators\n    # The 'miracle' move that allows for cooperation\n    Q = np.array([[1j, 0], [0, -1j]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # The optimal counter-strategy to Q, a quantum form of 'Defect'\n    D_prime = np.array([[0, 1], [-1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the game to find the Nash Equilibrium\n    # The game played with strategies Q and D' results in a classic Prisoner's Dilemma,\n    # where (D', D') is the dominant strategy and the only Nash Equilibrium.\n    # We will calculate the payoff for this equilibrium point.\n    equilibrium_strategy_A = D_prime\n    equilibrium_strategy_B = D_prime\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the final state and payoffs for the equilibrium\n    # The final state |ψ'> is calculated as J† (U_A ⊗ U_B) J |ψ_initial>\n    psi_initial = J @ ket00\n    U_game = np.kron(equilibrium_strategy_A, equilibrium_strategy_B)\n    psi_transformed = U_game @ psi_initial\n    J_dag = J.conj().T\n    psi_final = J_dag @ psi_transformed\n\n    # Probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD)\n    prob_CC = np.abs(psi_final[0, 0])**2\n    prob_CD = np.abs(psi_final[1, 0])**2\n    prob_DC = np.abs(psi_final[2, 0])**2\n    prob_DD = np.abs(psi_final[3, 0])**2\n    \n    # Round for clean display\n    (pCC, pCD, pDC, pDD) = (round(p.real, 2) for p in [prob_CC, prob_CD, prob_DC, prob_DD])\n\n    # Calculate expected payoffs for each player\n    payoff_A = R * pCC + S * pCD + T * pDC + P * pDD\n    payoff_B = R * pCC + T * pCD + S * pDC + P * pDD\n\n    # Step 6: Print the detailed calculation for the equilibrium payoff\n    print(\"In the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, the Nash Equilibrium strategy is for both players to play a defecting strategy D'.\")\n    print(\"Here is the calculation for the payoff at the equilibrium point (D', D'):\\n\")\n    print(f\"Probabilities of outcomes: P(Cooperate, Cooperate) = {pCC}, P(Cooperate, Defect) = {pCD}, P(Defect, Cooperate) = {pDC}, P(Defect, Defect) = {pDD}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Final Payoff Equation for Player A:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff(A) = (R * P(CC)) + (S * P(CD)) + (T * P(DC)) + (P * P(DD))\")\n    print(f\"          = ({R} * {pCC}) + ({S} * {pCD}) + ({T} * {pDC}) + ({P} * {pDD})\")\n    print(f\"          = {payoff_A:.2f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Payoff Equation for Player B:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff(B) = (R * P(CC)) + (T * P(CD)) + (S * P(DC)) + (P * P(DD))\")\n    print(f\"          = ({R} * {pCC}) + ({T} * {pCD}) + ({S} * {pDC}) + ({P} * {pDD})\")\n    print(f\"          = {payoff_B:.2f}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The equilibrium point is the payoff profile ({payoff_A:.0f}, {payoff_B:.0f}).\")\n\nsolve_quantum_dilemma()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
