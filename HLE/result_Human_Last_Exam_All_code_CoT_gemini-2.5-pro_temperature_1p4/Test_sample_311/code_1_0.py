    # Compound 11 (a diol, 2 oxygens) is cleaved into two fragments, each with one oxygen.
    # The synthesis uses one fragment. This oxygen is protected and remains through the formation of 14.
    # The protecting group is removed after step 14. So, 14 contains the oxygen.

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # This question is phrased backward. Compound 10 is a precursor to 7.
    # Compound 10 is a "nitroolefin", made from nitromethane (MeNO2), which has one nitrogen.
    # Therefore, compound 10 has one nitrogen atom, which is then carried over to compound 7.
