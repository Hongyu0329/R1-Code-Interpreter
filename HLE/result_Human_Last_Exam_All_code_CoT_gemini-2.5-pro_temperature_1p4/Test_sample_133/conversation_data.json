    "This is a Connect 4 puzzle. To find the optimal moves for player 'O', we need to identify the moves that lead to a win in the shortest number of turns. The fastest win is a move that wins immediately. If that's not possible, the next best is a move that creates an unstoppable threat, guaranteeing a win on 'O's next turn.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this using a Python script:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: I will create a 6x7 grid to represent the game board, populating it with 'X', 'O', and '.' for empty spaces, based on the provided image.\n2.  **Identify Possible Moves**: I'll write a function to find all valid moves for the current player ('O'). A move is valid if the chosen column is not full.\n3.  **Simulate and Analyze**: The core of the script will be a two-ply lookahead (analyzing 'O's move, then every possible response by 'X', then 'O's counter-move).\n    *   The script will iterate through each of 'O's possible moves.\n    *   For each move, it will simulate placing an 'O' piece on a temporary board.\n    *   It will then check if this move results in a situation where no matter what move 'X' makes next, 'O' will have a winning move on the subsequent turn. This is known as creating a \"fork\" or an unblockable threat.\n4.  **Check for Wins**: A helper function will be created to scan the board and determine if a player has achieved a four-in-a-row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n5.  **Report Optimal Moves**: The script will collect all moves by 'O' that guarantee a win on the next turn. Finally, it will print these moves in the requested format (e.g., c4, f4).\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef solve_connect_four():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a Connect 4 board to find the optimal winning moves for player 'O'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Board setup: row 0 is the top, row 5 is the bottom\n    # The input board is visually flipped, so we map it carefully.\n    # [ . . . . . . . ] (row 0)\n    # [ . . . . . . . ] (row 1)\n    # [ . . . . . . . ] (row 2)\n    # [ . . .
