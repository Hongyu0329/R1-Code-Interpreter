    Analyzes which plots are suitable for monochromatic vision.

    - Plot 1 & 6: Use a palette with constant luminance, making categories indistinguishable in grayscale.
    - Plot 3 & 4: Use palettes with constant HSLuv lightness (l=60), making categories indistinguishable.
    - Plot 5: Uses a palette with sampled lightness values, but contains a duplicate lightness value (l=20),
      making two categories indistinguishable.
    - Plot 2: Uses a diverging palette (ocean.balance), which is designed to have varying luminance.
      This makes the categories distinguishable as different shades of gray.

    Therefore, only Plot 2 is interpretable for someone with full monochromatic vision.
