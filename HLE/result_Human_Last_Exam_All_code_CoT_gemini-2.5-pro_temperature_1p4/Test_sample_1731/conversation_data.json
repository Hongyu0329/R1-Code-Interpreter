    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying the principles of statistical mechanics, which are fundamentally justified by large deviation theory.\n\n1.  **Principle of Maximum Entropy:** The core idea connecting statistical mechanics to large deviation theory (like the theorems of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff) is that the equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable macroscopic configuration. This configuration is the one that can be realized in the most number of ways, i.e., it has the maximum entropy (`S`).\n2.  **System and Constraints:** The system is a gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume `V`. Photons are bosons. The key constraints are:\n    *   The total energy `E` is fixed (or has a fixed mean value).\n    *   Unlike a conventional gas, the total number of photons `N` is **not** conserved. They can be created and absorbed by the walls of the container.\n3.  **Derivation:** I will maximize the entropy for a Bose gas, `S = k_B * ln(W)`, subject only to the constraint of fixed total energy `E`. This is done using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n    *   This maximization yields the famous **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average number of photons `⟨n_ε⟩` in a quantum state of energy `ε`:\n        `⟨n_ε⟩ = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B*T)) - 1)`\n    *   The Lagrange multiplier is identified as `β = 1/(k_B*T)`, where `T` is the equilibrium temperature.\n4.  **Calculate Macroscopic Values:** To find the total equilibrium energy `E` and entropy `S`, I will integrate the energy per state (`ε * ⟨n_ε⟩`) and the entropy per state over all possible states. This requires using the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D box, which is `g(ε) = (V*ε²) / (π²*ħ³*c³)`.\n5.  **Final Formulas:** The result of these integrations are the well-known formulas for the energy (Stefan-Boltzmann Law) and entropy of black-body radiation.\n\nThe Python code below will present these final derived formulas, which represent the equilibrium values you asked for.\n\n```python\ndef find_bose_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program outlines the derivation and presents the final equilibrium values\n    for mean energy and entropy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas),\n    as requested by applying principles from large deviation theory.\n\n    The final equations are presented symbolically.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Equilibrium Energy and Entropy for a Photon Gas (Bose-Einstein Statistics)\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium state is found by maximizing the system's entropy subject to a\")\n    print(\"fixed total energy.
