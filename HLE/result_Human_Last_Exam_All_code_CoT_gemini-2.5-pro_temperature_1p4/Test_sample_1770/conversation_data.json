    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out the gene responsible for the first committed step in its catabolic pathway. This pathway involves the activation of p-coumaric acid to its CoA-thioester. I will identify the specific gene for this function and provide a Python script that prints this information.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the primary degradation pathway for p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*.\n2.  Pinpoint the gene that encodes the enzyme for the first step of this pathway, which is the p-coumarate:CoA ligase.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores the gene's identifier, common name, and function.\n4.  The script will then print a clear recommendation explaining which gene to knock out and why.\n\n```python\ndef suggest_knockout_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the gene knockout target to prevent\n    p-coumaric acid degradation in Corynebacterium glutamicum.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about the metabolic engineering problem\n    organism = \"Corynebacterium glutamicum\"\n    product_of_interest = \"p-coumaric acid\"\n    \n    # Identified gene target for knockout\n    gene_locus_tag = \"cg2900\"\n    gene_common_name = \"fic / couL\"\n    gene_function = \"p-Coumarate:CoA ligase\"\n    \n    # Explanation for the knockout strategy\n    explanation = (\n        \"In {organism}, the primary pathway for degrading {product} begins with its \"\n        \"activation to p-coumaroyl-CoA.
