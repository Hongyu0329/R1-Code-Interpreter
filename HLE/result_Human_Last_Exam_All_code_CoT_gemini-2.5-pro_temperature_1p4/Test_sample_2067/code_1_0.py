    # The system of equations is:
    # 1) y = f(sin(pi*x))
    # 2) x = f(cos(2*pi*y))

    # The range of f(t) is [0, 1], so x and y must be in [0, 1].

    # An integer component must be 0 or 1.

    # From (1), y = f(sin(0)) = f(0) = cos(0)^2 = 1.
    # Check (0, 1) in (2): x = f(cos(2*pi*1)) = f(1) = cos(pi)^2 = 1.

    # From (2), x = f(cos(2*pi)) = f(1) = 1.

    # Part 2: Find the total number of solutions.
    # This is done by analyzing the intersections of the graphs of the two equations.
    # Let C1 be the graph of y = f(sin(pi*x))
    # Let C2 be the graph of x = f(cos(2*pi*y))
    
    # The curve C1 has a 'W' shape. For any y in (0,1), there are 4 distinct x values.
    # The curve C2 snakes back and forth between x=0 and x=1 eight times as y goes from 0 to 1.
    # These eight monotonic segments of C2 are over the y-intervals:
    # [0, 1/6], [1/6, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3], [1/3, 1/2],
    # [1/2, 2/3], [2/3, 3/4], [3/4, 5/6], [5/6, 1].

    # For each of these 8 y-intervals, the C2 curve connects a point on the line x=0 to a point on x=1,
    # or vice-versa.
    # For any of these intervals, say [y_a, y_b], the C1 curve has four branches.
    # A careful check shows that at y_a, the x-value from C2 is either greater than all 4 x-values from C1
    # or smaller than all 4. The opposite is true at y_b.
    # This guarantees that the C2 curve crosses each of the 4 branches of C1 within that interval.
    # The endpoints of the intervals are not solutions, except for (1,1), which is a transversal intersection.
    # So, each of the 8 monotonic segments of C2 intersects C1 in 4 places.
    
    total_solutions = 8 * 4
    
    # The final answer is the total number of solutions and the number of pairs with at least one integer.
