    "The user wants to find the minimum total number of vertices in a set of bipartite graphs whose edges cover the complete graph $K_n$ for $n=35$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Interpret the Problem**: The question asks for the minimum value of the sum of the number of vertices of bipartite subgraphs of $K_n$ whose edge sets together cover all edges of $K_n$. Let the family of bipartite subgraphs be $\\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_m\\}$. We need to find the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^m |V(B_i)|$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Theorem**: This is a known problem in extremal graph theory. A theorem by Fan Chung Graham provides the exact answer. The theorem states that the minimum total number of vertices required is $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula**: The task is now reduced to a calculation:\n    *   Set $n = 35$.\n    *   Calculate $\\log_2(35)$.\n    *   Find the ceiling of this value, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\log_2(35)$.\n    *   Multiply the result by $n$.\n\n4.  **Write the Code**: I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will use the `math` library for the logarithm and ceiling functions. As requested, the script will print out each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n for n = 35.\n\n    This problem is a known result in graph theory, solved by Fan Chung Graham.\n    The formula for the minimum sum of vertices is n * ceil(log2(n)).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate log base 2 of n.\n    log_n_base_2 = math.log2(n)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the ceiling of the result.\n    # 2^5 = 32 and 2^6 = 64, so log2(35) is between 5 and 6.\n    # The ceiling will be 6.\n    ceil_log_n = math.ceil(log_n_base_2)\n\n    # Step 3: Multiply by n to get the final answer.\n    min_total_vertices = n * ceil_log_n\n\n    # Output the explanation and the breakdown of the calculation.\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering K_n for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"According to a theorem by Fan Chung Graham, this value is given by the formula: n * ceil(log2(n)).\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"1. n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"2. log2({n}) is approximately {log_n_base_2:.4f}.\")\n    print(f\"3. The ceiling of log2({n}) is {ceil_log_n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with the numbers plugged in is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} * {ceil_log_n} = {min_total_vertices}\")\n\nsolve_graph_problem()\n```\n<<<210>>>"
