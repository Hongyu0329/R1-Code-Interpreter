    "To determine the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces, we can use computational geometry to simulate the scenario.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Model the Icosahedron**: First, I will create a digital 3D model of an icosahedron using the coordinates of its 12 vertices and the definitions of its 20 triangular faces and 30 edges.\n2.  **Orient the Tank**: I will simulate placing the icosahedron \"standing on one of its faces\". This involves rotating the entire shape in 3D space so that one triangular face is perfectly horizontal and positioned at the bottom of the tank (the z=0 plane).\n3.  **Find the Half-Fill Level**: For a perfectly symmetric shape like an icosahedron, the plane that cuts the volume in half is exactly at the midpoint of its total height. I will calculate this mid-height level. The water surface will be a flat plane at this height.\n4.  **Determine the Water Surface Shape**: The shape of the water surface is the cross-section created by the intersection of the horizontal water plane with the icosahedron tank. My script will find all the points where the edges of the icosahedron intersect this mid-height plane.\n5.  **Analyze and Report**: These intersection points form the vertices of a polygon. By counting these vertices and analyzing their geometric properties (like side lengths and distance from the center), the code will determine the exact shape of the water surface and print a descriptive result, including the coordinates of the shape's vertices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation\n\ndef solve_icosahedron_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and describes the shape of the water surface in a half-filled\n    icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Icosahedron Geometry\n    # The golden ratio, phi\n    PHI = (1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2\n\n    # Icosahedron vertices (these form three orthogonal golden rectangles)\n    # The edge length for this set of vertices is 2.\n    vertices = np.array([\n        [-1,  PHI,  0], [ 1,  PHI,  0], [-1, -PHI,  0], [ 1, -PHI,  0],\n        [ 0, -1,  PHI], [ 0,  1,  PHI], [ 0, -1, -PHI], [ 0,  1, -PHI],\n        [PHI,  0, -1], [PHI,  0,  1], [-PHI,  0, -1], [-PHI,  0,  1]\n    ])\n\n    # Icosahedron faces are defined by indices into the vertices array.\n    faces = np.array([\n        [0, 11, 5], [0, 5, 1], [0, 1, 7], [0, 7, 10], [0, 10, 11],\n        [1, 5, 9], [5, 11, 4], [11, 10, 2], [10, 7, 6], [7, 1, 8],\n        [3, 9, 4], [3, 4, 2], [3, 2, 6], [3, 6, 8], [3, 8, 9],\n        [4, 9, 5], [2, 4, 11], [6, 2, 10], [8, 6, 7], [9, 8, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Define the 30 unique edges from the faces for intersection checks.\n    edges = set()\n    for face in faces:\n        for i in range(3):\n            v1_idx, v2_idx = face[i], face[(i + 1) % 3]\n            # Store as a sorted tuple to ensure each edge is added only once.\n            edge = tuple(sorted((v1_idx, v2_idx)))\n            edges.add(edge)\n    edges = np.array(list(edges))\n\n    # Step 2: Orient the Icosahedron\n    # Pick the first face to be the base and calculate its normal vector.\n    base_face_indices = faces[0]\n    v1, v2, v3 = vertices[base_face_indices]\n    normal = np.cross(v2 -
