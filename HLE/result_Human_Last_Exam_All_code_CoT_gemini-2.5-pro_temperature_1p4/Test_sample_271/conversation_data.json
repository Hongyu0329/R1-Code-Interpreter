    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: The first step is to factor the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. This will break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n2.  **Identify Splitting Fields and Galois Groups of Factors**: For each irreducible factor, we determine its splitting field and its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let the factors be $f_1(x), f_2(x), \\dots, f_m(x)$. We find the splitting fields $K_1, K_2, \\dots, K_m$ and the Galois groups $\\text{Gal}(K_i/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois Group of the Full Polynomial**: The splitting field $K$ of the original polynomial $f(x)$ is the compositum of the individual splitting fields ($K = K_1 K_2 \\dots K_m$). The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ can be determined from the individual Galois groups and their relationships. We will find that $G \\cong C_2 \\times S_3$.\n\n4.  **Apply Galois Theory**: The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the subfields of $K$ containing $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the subgroups of $G$. A subfield $L$ is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if its corresponding Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the index of the normal subgroup in $G$, i.e., $|G|/|\\text{Gal}(K/L)|$.\n\n5.  **Find Normal Subgroups and Their Indices**: We need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_3$. The indices of these subgroups will give us the set of all possible degrees for the normal subfields $L$ that are strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\n6.  **List the Possible Degrees**: The final answer will be the set of unique indices calculated in the previous step.\n\nFollowing this plan, the Python code below will first perform the factorization and then, based on the subsequent group-theoretic analysis, print the final list of possible degrees.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_field_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and presents the solution.\n    It first factors the polynomial, which is the starting point for the Galois theory analysis.\n    The rest of the logic, derived from group theory, determines the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the polynomial\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    poly = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n    \n    # Factor the polynomial over the rational numbers\n    factored_poly = sympy.factor(poly, domain='QQ')\n    \n    print(f\"The polynomial f(x) = {poly} factors over Q into:\")\n    print(f\"f(x) = {factored_poly}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2-5: Analysis based on Galois Theory\n    # The factors are (x**2 - 2), (x**2 + 3), and (x**3 - 3).\n    # The Galois group of f(x) over Q is G = Gal(Q(sqrt(2))/Q) x Gal(Q(cbrt(3), omega)/Q).\n    # This is because Q(sqrt(2)) intersect Q(cbrt(3), omega) is Q.\n    # The Galois group is therefore G ~ C_2 x S_3, with |G| = 2 * 6 = 12.\n    #\n    # Normal subfields L (Q < L < K) correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups H of G.\n    # The degree [L:Q] = |G|/|H|.\n    #\n    # The proper non-trivial normal subgroups H of C_2 x S_3 and their indices are:\n    # 1.
