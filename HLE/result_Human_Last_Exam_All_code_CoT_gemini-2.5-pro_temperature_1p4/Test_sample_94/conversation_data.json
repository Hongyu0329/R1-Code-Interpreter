    "Based on the anecdote, the physicist you are referring to is Paul Kirkpatrick. In the 1940s, a custodial worker named Oscar Hainline noticed that reflections from the long, curved fluorescent light bulbs off a freshly polished metal surface in Kirkpatrick's lab formed a sharp, bright line. Kirkpatrick realized the significance of this observation: a cylindrically curved mirror focuses light to a line. He then reasoned that using two such mirrors oriented at 90 degrees to each other could focus X-rays (which reflect only at a shallow, glancing angle) to a single point. This invention is now known as the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system, a cornerstone of X-ray microscopy.\n\nHere is a Python script to output the name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the physicist\n    who developed a new type of X-ray microscope after a\n    custodial worker made an accidental observation.\n    \"\"\"\n    physicist = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\n    print(physicist)\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
