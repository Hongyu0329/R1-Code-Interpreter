    "My plan to identify the radical (bushu) for the character \"謄\" is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the character**: I will analyze the structure of the kanji \"謄\" to identify its constituent parts. The character is composed of a left part and a right part.\n2.  **Identify the radical**: The left part of the character is \"月\". In many kanji, when \"月\" appears as the left-hand component, it is a variant form of the radical \"肉\" (niku), meaning meat or flesh. This radical is known as \"nikuzuki\".\n3.  **Confirm the radical name**: I will confirm that \"Nikuzuki\" is the correct Hepburn transcription for the name of this radical. The Japanese name is にくづき.\n4.  **Generate Python code**: I will write a simple Python script to print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The Japanese character is 謄.\n# This character can be broken down into two components: 月 (on the left) and 朕 (on the right).\n# The radical (bushu) is the component on the left, which is 月.\n# When 月 appears as a radical on the left side of a character, it is often a variant of the radical 肉 (meat).\n# The Japanese name for this radical form is にくづき (nikuzuki).\n# This script will print the Hepburn transcription of \"にくづき\".\n\nradical_name_hepburn = \"Nikuzuki\"\nprint(radical_name_hepburn)\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
