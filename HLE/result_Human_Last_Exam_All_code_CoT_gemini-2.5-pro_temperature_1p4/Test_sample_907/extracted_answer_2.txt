For case a) (no interaction), the equation is σₐ(ω) = C⋅N⋅ω₀⋅|μₑg|²⋅exp(-(ω-ω₀)²τ²). For case b) (with interaction), the absorption peak is shifted to a new frequency ωⱼ = ω₀ + 2J/ħ and the equation becomes σₙ(ω) = C⋅N⋅ωⱼ⋅|μₑg|²⋅exp(-(ω-ωⱼ)²τ²), where the N factor in the magnitude arises from the coherent superposition of molecular dipoles.
