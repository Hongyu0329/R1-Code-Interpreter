def solve_cube_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the cube puzzle through logical deduction.
    The goal is to find the minimum number of colors required to tile an infinite x,y plane.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the case with a cardinality of 1.
    # A plane of a single color is impossible.
    # - A plane of only White cubes cannot be built because placing a second White cube requires it to be adjacent to two cubes of different colors, which cannot be satisfied.
    # - A plane of only Blue cubes cannot be built because a Blue cube must attach to a White or Orange cube.
    # - A plane of only Orange cubes cannot be built because an Orange cube must attach to a White cube.
    # Conclusion: The cardinality cannot be 1.

    # Step 2: Analyze the case with a cardinality of 2.
    # We must start with a White cube, so we only need to consider {White, Blue} and {White, Orange}.
    # - {White, Orange}: An Orange cube can only be placed adjacent to a White cube in the z-direction. This means it cannot be placed next to a White cube within the same x,y plane. Thus, a 2D plane cannot be tiled with only White and Orange.
    # - {White, Blue}: To place a White cube, it must be adjacent to two cubes of different colors (in this case, a White one and a Blue one). While small, finite patterns can be created, it's impossible to create a pattern that expands infinitely. Any attempt to tile the plane will eventually result in a boundary where no new White cubes can be placed because every available spot is adjacent to cubes of only one color.
    # Conclusion: The cardinality cannot be 2.

    # Step 3: Analyze the case with a cardinality of 3.
    # Since cardinalities of 1 and 2 are impossible, the minimum required number of colors must be 3, provided that tiling with 3 colors is possible.
    # With all three colors, it is possible to construct a plane. The rules involving the z-direction can be used to "seed" the plane with the necessary variety of colors. For example, one can create a White and an Orange cube in the same plane, which is the necessary condition to build self-sustaining, expandable patterns.
    # Once White, Orange, and Blue cubes are all present in the plane, the rules for placing new White cubes (requiring two different neighbors) and Blue cubes (requiring a White or Orange neighbor) can be consistently met.
    
    # The set of colors is {White, Blue, Orange}.
    cardinality = 3
