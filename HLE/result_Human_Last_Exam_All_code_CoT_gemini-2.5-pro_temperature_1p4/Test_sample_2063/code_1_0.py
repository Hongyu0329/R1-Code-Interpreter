# The problem asks for the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.
# Our analysis has shown that this limit has the closed-form expression (7/8)^8.

# Here are the numbers in the final equation:
base = 7
modulus_and_power = 8

# We calculate the numerator and the denominator of the expression.
numerator = base ** modulus_and_power
denominator = modulus_and_power ** modulus_and_power

# The final probability is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator.
probability = numerator / denominator
