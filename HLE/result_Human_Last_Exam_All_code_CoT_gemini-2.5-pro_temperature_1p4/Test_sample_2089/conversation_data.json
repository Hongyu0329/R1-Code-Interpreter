    "Of course. I can answer that trivia question for you.\n\nMy plan is to first identify the specific scene and the Oscar-nominated film you're referring to. Then, to adhere to your request for a code-based solution, I will write a simple Python script that prints the name of the film as the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n```python\n# The film described is the 2005 Steven Spielberg movie, \"Munich\".\n# The movie was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n# The scene involves the character Carl, a member of the Israeli assassination team.\n# While on a bus, he is trying to remain inconspicuous but is accosted by a group of drunks.\n# To placate them, he says \"Thank you,\" which reveals his foreign accent to a waiting assassin,\n# leading directly to his being tracked and killed.\n\nfilm_title = \"Munich\"\n\nprint(f\"The film in which a character seals his fate by saying 'Thank you' on a bus is: {film_title}\")\n```\n<<<Munich>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
