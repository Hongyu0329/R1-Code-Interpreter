    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Let $n$ be the number of vertices in the graph, so $n=12345$.\n2.  Recall the properties of the chromatic number of a graph. A graph $G$ with $n$ vertices can be colored with $n$ colors. The only case where $n$ colors are strictly necessary is when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This is the definition of a complete graph, $K_n$. So, $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G = K_n$.\n3.  The problem states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means there must be at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge.\n4.  Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring. This immediately tells us that we don't need $n$ distinct colors. We can color the graph with at most $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the maximum possible value for $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n-1$.\n5.  To determine if this maximum is achievable, we need to see if we can construct a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors.\n6.  Consider a graph formed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding one new vertex that is not connected to any other vertex (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This graph has $n$ vertices in total.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is missing edges to all other vertices.\n    *   The $K_{n-1}$ subgraph by itself requires $n-1$ colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these $n-1$ colors. Thus, the chromatic number of the entire graph is $n-1$.\n7.  Since we have shown that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$ for any non-complete graph, and we have found a specific non-complete graph where $\\chi(G) = n-1$, we can conclude that the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n8.  I will write a Python script to calculate this value for $n=12345$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with n vertices, given that the graph is not complete.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph\n    n_vertices = 12345\n    \n    # For any graph G with n vertices, the chromatic number chi(G) is n\n    # if and only if G is the complete graph K_n.\n    # The problem states that G is not a complete graph. This means there is at least\n    # one pair of non-adjacent vertices. These two vertices can share the same color.\n    # Therefore, the chromatic number must be less than n. The maximum possible\n    # value is n - 1.\n    \n    # We can construct a graph that achieves this maximum. For example, a graph\n    # consisting of a complete subgraph on (n-1) vertices (K_{n-1}) and one\n    # additional isolated vertex. This graph has n vertices, is not complete,\n    # and its chromatic number is n-1.\n    \n    # So, the maximum number of colors needed is n - 1.\n    max_colors = n_vertices - 1\n    \n    print(f\"The number of vertices in the graph G is n = {n_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of G is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
