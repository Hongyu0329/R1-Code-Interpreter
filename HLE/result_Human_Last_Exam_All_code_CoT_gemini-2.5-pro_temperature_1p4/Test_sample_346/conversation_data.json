    "My approach to solving this problem is to use Python to build a system that can understand and evaluate SKI combinator expressions. A manual, step-by-step reduction of such a complex expression is highly prone to errors. A computational approach is more reliable.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Represent SKI Combinators**: I'll define Python classes for the `S`, `K`, and `I` combinators, as well as for the `App` (application) operation, which represents one expression being applied to another (e.g., `(F X)`).\n2.  **Parse the Expression**: I'll write a parser that takes the given string `S(I)(S(I)...)` and converts it into a tree of combinator and application objects. This tree will accurately represent the structure of the expression.\n3.  **Find the Integer Value**: A Church integer `n` is a function that, when given a function `f` and a value `x`, computes `f(f(...f(x)...))` (with `f` applied `n` times). To find `n`, I will create two symbolic variables, `f` and `x`, and apply the parsed expression to them. The expression to evaluate will be `(n f) x`.\n4.  **Reduce the Expression**: I'll create a reduction engine that repeatedly applies the fundamental rules of SKI calculus (`S x y z -> x z (y z)`, `K x y -> x`, `I x -> x`) to the expression tree until it cannot be simplified any further. This simplified state is known as the normal form.\n5.  **Count the Applications**: The normal form of `(n f) x` will be a nested structure of applications equivalent to `f(f(...f(x)...))`. I will then simply count the number of `f`'s in this structure to determine the integer `n`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Once `n` is known, I will calculate `log_2(n)` and display the result.\n\nThis method automates the complex symbolic manipulation, ensuring an accurate result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# The user wants to find `log_2(n)` for a Church integer `n` given by a complex SKI expression.\n# Church integers are functions that represent natural numbers through repeated application.\n# For example, the integer `3` is represented by a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`,\n# and returns `f(f(f(x)))`.\n# The SKI expression is a way to build such functions using only three basic combinators: S, K, and I.\n# The reduction rules are:\n# S x y z -> x z (y z)\n# K x y   -> x\n# I x     -> x\n# The plan is to programmatically evaluate the given expression to find `n`.\n# 1.  Represent the SKI combinators and the application operation using Python classes.\n#     I will use classes for `S`, `K`, `I`, and `App` for application `(f x)`.\n# 2.  Create a parser to convert the input string, which uses a function-like notation `F(X)(Y)`,\n#     into a tree of these objects.\n# 3.  To find what integer `n` the expression represents, we will apply it to symbolic variables 'f' and 'x'.\n#     The expression to evaluate becomes `(given_expression f) x`.\n# 4.  Implement a reduction engine that repeatedly applies the S, K, and I rules to this expression\n#     tree until it can no longer be simplified. This is called finding the normal form.\n# 5.  The final reduced form should be f(f(...f(x)...)). I will count the number of applications of 'f' to determine the integer n.\n# 6.  Finally, calculate log_2(n) and print the required equation and final answer.\n# This computational approach avoids the high risk of errors in manual symbolic manipulation of such a complex expression.\n\ndef solve_ski_church_log():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the SKI combinator problem by parsing, reducing, and interpreting the expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define classes for SKI calculus representation.\n    # Set a higher recursion limit as the reduction can be very deep.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n\n    class S_c:\n        def __repr__(self): return \"S\"\n    class K_c:\n        def __repr__(self): return \"K\"\n    class I_c:\n        def __repr__(self): return \"I\"\n    class Var:\n        def __init__(self, name): self.name = name\n        def __repr__(self): return self.name\n    class App:\n        def __init__(self, func, arg):\n            self.func = func\n            self.arg = arg\n        def __repr__(self):\n            return f\"({self.func} {self.arg})\"\n\n    S, K, I = S_c(), K_c(), I_c()\n\n    # Step 2: Implement the parser for the F(X)(Y) notation.\n    def parse(s):\n        s_ptr = [0]\n        s_clean = s.replace(\" \", \"\")\n\n        def parse_expression(text):\n            if text[s_ptr[0]] == 'S': expr = S; s_ptr[0] += 1\n            elif text[s_ptr[0]] == 'K': expr = K; s_ptr[0] += 1\n            elif text[s_ptr[0]] == 'I': expr = I; s_ptr[0] += 1\n            else: raise ValueError(f\"Invalid start: {text[s_ptr[0]]}\")\n            \n            while s_ptr[0] < len(text) and text[s_ptr[0]] == '(':\n                s_ptr[0] += 1\n                arg = parse_expression(text)\n                expr = App(expr, arg)\n                if s_ptr[0] >= len(text) or text[s_ptr[0]] != ')':\n                    raise ValueError(\"Mismatched parentheses\")\n                s_ptr[0] += 1\n            return expr\n        return parse_expression(s_clean)\n\n    # Step 4: Implement the reduction engine.\n    reduction_cache = {}\n    def reduce_expression(expr):\n        if not isinstance(expr, App): return expr, False\n        \n        # Use object id as key for caching, as expressions are immutable trees.\n        expr_id = id(expr)\n        if expr_id in reduction_cache:\n            return reduction_cache[expr_id], False\n        \n        original_expr = expr\n        changed = True\n        while changed:\n            # Reduce function, then argument\n            func, func_changed = reduce_expression(expr.func)\n            if func_changed:\n                expr = App(func, expr.arg)\n\n            arg, arg_changed = reduce_expression(expr.arg)\n            if arg_changed:\n                expr = App(expr.func, arg)\n\n            # Apply reduction rules at the current level.\n            f = expr.func\n            c = False\n            if isinstance(f, I_c):\n                expr = expr.arg; c = True\n            elif isinstance(f, App):\n                ff = f.func\n                if isinstance(ff, K_c):\n                    expr = f.arg; c = True\n                elif isinstance(ff, App) and isinstance(ff.func, S_c):\n                    x, y, z = ff.arg, f.arg, expr.arg\n                    expr = App(App(x, z), App(y, z)); c = True\n            \n            changed = func_changed or arg_changed or c\n\n        reduction_cache[expr_id] = expr\n        return expr, expr is not original_expr\n\n    def reduce_full(expr):\n        changed = True\n        while changed:\n            expr, changed = reduce_expression(expr)\n        return expr\n\n    # Step 5: Implement the counter for `f` applications.\n    def count_f(expr, f_var, x_var):\n        count = 0\n        current = expr\n        while isinstance(current, App):\n            if current.func != f_var: return None\n            count += 1\n            current = current.arg\n        return count if current == x_var else None\n\n    # Main logic execution\n    expression_string = \"S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\"\n    \n    # 3.
