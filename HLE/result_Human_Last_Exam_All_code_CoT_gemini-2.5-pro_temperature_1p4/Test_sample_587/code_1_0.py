# The problem is #Sub_G(H), counting subgraphs of G isomorphic to H.

# Example: Let H be a 3-clique (a triangle).
# This corresponds to option B, where H is the class of all cliques.
# The problem is then #k-CLIQUE.

A. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable for every class H.
   - FALSE. If H is the class of cliques, the problem is #k-CLIQUE. On a 'somewhere dense' class G, this problem is #W[1]-complete, the canonical example of a fixed-parameter intractable counting problem.

B. If H is the class of all cliques, then #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
   - TRUE. As stated above, counting k-cliques is #W[1]-complete on any class of graphs that is not 'nowhere dense'. 'Somewhere dense' is the negation of 'nowhere dense'. This statement is a known result.

C. There exists a class H of graphs of degree at most 2 such that #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
   - FALSE. A graph of maximum degree at most 2 is a disjoint union of paths and cycles. All such graphs have a treewidth of at most 2. Counting subgraphs for a pattern H with bounded treewidth is known to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).

D. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded treewidth.
   - TRUE. This is a fundamental dichotomy theorem in parameterized complexity.
     - (if): If H has bounded treewidth, the problem is FPT. Algorithms exist (e.g., based on dynamic programming over a tree decomposition of H) that run in FPT time, regardless of the host graph G.
     - (only if): If H has unbounded treewidth, the problem is #W[1]-hard. The 'somewhere dense' property of G ensures the class of host graphs is rich enough for hardness reductions from problems like #k-CLIQUE to hold.
   - This statement provides a complete characterization and is the most encompassing correct statement.

E. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded vertex-cover number.
   - FALSE. This gives the wrong condition. While bounded vertex cover implies bounded treewidth (so the 'if' part is true), the 'only if' part is false. For example, the class of paths has unbounded vertex cover, but counting k-paths is FPT because paths have treewidth 1.
