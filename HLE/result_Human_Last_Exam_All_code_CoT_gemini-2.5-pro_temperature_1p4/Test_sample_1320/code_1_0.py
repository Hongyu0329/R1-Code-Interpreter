# Alanine is an alpha-amino acid.

# Step 2: Calculate the size of the first stabilizing H-bond ring.
# This is typically an i -> i+3 bond in an alternating alpha/epsilon sequence.
# The bond forms between the C=O of Ala(i) and the N-H of epsilon(i+3).
# The atoms in the ring are from:
# - The N-H group of the H-bond acceptor residue (epsilon at i+3)
# - The backbone of the residue at position i+2 (Alanine)
# - The backbone of the residue at position i+1 (epsilon-AA)
# - The C=O group of the H-bond donor residue (Alanine at i)

# Contributions to the ring size
h_n_group_atoms = 2

# The residues in the covalent loop are Ala(i+2) and Epsilon(i+1)
