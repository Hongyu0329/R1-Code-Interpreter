# This script models the predicted biological effect of Interleukin-15 (IL-15) on CAR T cell function.
# The values used are for conceptual demonstration, not direct experimental data.

# Plan:
# 1. Establish a baseline relative value for cytokine release from CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15.
# 2. Define a predicted enhancement factor based on the known biological role of IL-15 in improving T cell fitness and potency.
# 3. Calculate the new predicted cytokine release for CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15.
# 4. Print the conclusion and the conceptual equation clearly.

# Step 1: Let's define a baseline unit for cytokine release (e.g., IFN-gamma) in T cells made without IL-15.
# We'll set this to 100 for an easy-to-understand relative comparison.
baseline_cytokine_release = 100.0

# Step 2: IL-15 is known to create more persistent and potent "memory" T cells.
# We predict this will lead to a significantly stronger response upon activation.
# Let's model this with a strong enhancement factor, for instance, a 180% increase (factor of 2.8).
il15_enhancement_factor = 2.8

# Step 3: Calculate the predicted cytokine release for the IL-15 enhanced CAR T cells.
predicted_release_with_il15 = baseline_cytokine_release * il15_enhancement_factor

# Step 4: Output the prediction and the conceptual equation.
