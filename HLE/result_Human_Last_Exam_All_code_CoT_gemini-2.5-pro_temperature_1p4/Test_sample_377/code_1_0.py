# The problem reduces to finding the number of blocks of kS.
# Since the characteristic of the field k (which is 2) does not divide
# the order of the group S (which is 27), the group algebra kS is
# semisimple. For a semisimple algebra over a large enough (splitting) field,
# the number of blocks is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the group.
#
# S is the extraspecial group 3^{1+2}_+. This is a group of order p^(2n+1)
# with p=3 and n=1. The number of its conjugacy classes is given by the
# formula: p^(2n) + p - 1.

# Parameters for the extraspecial group S
p = 3
n = 1

# Calculate the terms of the formula for the number of conjugacy classes.
term1 = p**(2 * n)
term2 = p
term3 = -1 # Representing the subtraction in the formula

# The final number of classes (and thus blocks)
num_blocks = term1 + term2 + term3
