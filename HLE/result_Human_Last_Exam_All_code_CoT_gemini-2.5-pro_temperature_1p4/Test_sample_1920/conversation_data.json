    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d$ and order $k$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the conductor and order:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\chi_i$, where $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the prime factorization of $d$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components.\n\n2.  **Specialize to the given problem:** We are given the conductor $d = 53599$ and order $k = 6$.\n    *   First, we find the prime factorization of $d$.\n    *   Since the resulting factorization is square-free ($d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$), a character is primitive if and only if none of its components $\\chi_i$ are the trivial (principal) character.\n    *   The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $m$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(m)$, provided that $m$ divides $p-1$.\n\n3.  **Counting Strategy (Inclusion-Exclusion):**\n    *   We need to find the number of tuples of non-principal characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r)) = 6$.\n    *   This implies that for each $i$, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ must be a divisor of 6, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Since the characters must be non-principal, their orders must be greater than 1, so $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   Let $S_m$ be the set of primitive characters whose order divides $m$. We want to calculate $|S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2|$.\n    *   The number of non-principal characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides $m$ is $\\sum_{j|m, j>1} \\phi(j)$, assuming $m | (p_i-1)$.\n    *   The total number of primitive characters whose order divides $m$ is $(\\sum_{j|m, j>1} \\phi(j))^r$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this logic to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of unique prime factors of n.\n    Raises ValueError if n is not square-free.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            temp_n //= d\n            if temp_n % d == 0:\n                raise ValueError(f\"{n} is not square-free, this method is for square-free conductors.\")\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors.append(temp_n)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {k}.\\n\")\n\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Factorize the conductor d\n        prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n        r = len(prime_factors)\n        print(f\"Step 1: The conductor d = {d} is square-free.\")\n        print(f\"The prime factorization is d = {' * '.join(map(str, prime_factors))}.\")\n        print(f\"The number of prime factors is r = {r}.\\n\")\n\n        # Step 2: Verify conditions for existence of characters of required order\n        print(f\"Step 2: For a character component of order m to exist modulo a prime p, m must divide p-1.\")\n        print(f\"We need characters of order dividing 6, so we check if 6 divides p-1 for each prime factor p.\")\n        for p in prime_factors:\n            if (p - 1) % k != 0:\n                print(f\"Error: For prime factor {p}, {p-1} is not divisible by {k}.\")\n                print(\"Cannot form characters of order 6.
