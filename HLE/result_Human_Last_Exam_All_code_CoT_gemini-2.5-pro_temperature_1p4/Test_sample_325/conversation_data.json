    "Of course, I can help with that. This question relates to a deep result in an area of mathematics called harmonic analysis.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory**: The question asks for the \"sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent.\" This is determined by a theorem from Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth. The theorem gives a formula for this exponent based on the dimension of the space and a property of the curve called \"non-degeneracy.\"\n2.  **State the Formula**: For a non-degenerate curve in an $n$-dimensional space ($\\mathbb{R}^n$), the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is $p = n(n+1)$.\n3.  **Verify the Condition**: For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, \"non-degenerate\" means its first three derivatives (velocity, acceleration, and jerk) are linearly independent. We can verify this by showing that the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is non-zero.\n4.  **Execute with Code**: I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to:\n    *   Define the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$.\n    *   Find the dimension, $n=3$.\n    *   Compute the first three derivatives.\n    *   Calculate the determinant to prove non-degeneracy.\n    *   Apply the formula $p = n(n+1)$ to get the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Step 1: Define the curve and the dimension of the space\nt = sp.symbols('t')\n# The curve is gamma(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t)\ngamma = sp.Matrix([sp.cos(t), sp.sin(t), t])\n# The space is R^n, where n is the number of components of the curve\nn = len(gamma)\n\nprint(f\"The given curve is gamma(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t) in R^n, where n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Step 2: State the relevant theorem\nprint(\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in R^n\")\nprint(\"is given by the formula p = n * (n + 1).\")\nprint(\"\\nTo apply this formula, we must first verify that the curve is non-degenerate.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Step 3: Verify the non-degeneracy condition for the curve\nprint(\"For a curve in R^3, non-degeneracy requires that its first three\")\nprint(\"derivatives are linearly independent.
