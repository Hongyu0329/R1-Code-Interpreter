    explanation = """The patient's clinical presentation, including the history of wearing new workout clothes and the physical finding of a rash on the periphery of the axillary folds while sparing the vault, is highly suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis from textiles (clothing).

The goal is to choose the best next step for *diagnosis*. Let's evaluate the options:

1.  **A. Skin biopsy:** This is generally reserved for when the diagnosis is uncertain or if a more serious condition is suspected. It is not the initial standard of care for a classic case of contact dermatitis.
2.  **B. KOH preparation:** This test is used to diagnose fungal infections. While possible in skin folds, the specific rash distribution and strong historical clue (new clothes) make a fungal cause less likely than an allergic one.
3.  **C. Topical steroid:** This is a *treatment* to reduce inflammation and itching, not a diagnostic test to determine the cause.
4.  **D. Patch test:** This is the gold standard diagnostic test for allergic contact dermatitis. It is used to identify the specific substance (allergen) that is causing the reaction. Given the suspicion of a textile allergy, a patch test would confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the causative agent (e.g., a specific dye or resin in the fabric). The case text itself validates this by mentioning that a patch test was ultimately performed with positive results.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis is the patch test."""
