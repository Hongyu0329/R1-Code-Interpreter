# Step 1: Determine the change in the chromatic number of the Asian country graph.

# The graph of countries on a map is a planar graph. The Four Color Theorem states
# that the chromatic number of any such graph is at most 4.
print("Based on the Four Color Theorem, the chromatic number of the Asian map is at most 4.")

# Before the dissolution, the complex borders of Asia already necessitated 4 colors for a valid map coloring.
chi_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution was {chi_before}.")

# After the dissolution, new countries and borders were created in Central Asia.
# The map's graph remained planar, and its complexity ensured the chromatic number was still 4.
chi_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph after the Soviet dissolution remained {chi_after}.")

# The incremental change, delta_soviet, is the difference between the two chromatic numbers.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The change in the chromatic number, delta_soviet, is {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Determine the change in planarity of the graph.

# A graph representing a political map of contiguous countries is, by definition, planar.
print("A geographical map graph of contiguous countries is inherently a planar graph.")

# The dissolution of the USSR changed the map's components but not its fundamental planar nature.
# The graph of Asian countries remained planar after the event.
print("The dissolution did not change the planarity of the graph.")

# The problem states to set beta to 1 if planarity did not change, and 2 if it did.
beta = 1
print(f"As the planarity did not change, beta is set to {beta}.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.

# The final result is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print("The final result is the product of beta and delta_soviet.")
print(f"Final calculation: {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")

print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
