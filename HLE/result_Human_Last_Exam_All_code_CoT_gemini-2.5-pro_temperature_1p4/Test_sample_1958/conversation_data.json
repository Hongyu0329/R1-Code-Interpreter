    "To find the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, I will perform a systematic search.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Create a list of the books of the Bible in their canonical order, starting with the Old Testament.\n2.  Create a dictionary of Shakespeare's plays and URLs to their full text from Project Gutenberg.\n3.  Iterate through the list of Bible books. For each book, I will then iterate through all the Shakespeare plays.\n4.  For each play, I will download its text content.\n5.  I will search the play's text for the name of the current Bible book. The search will be case-insensitive and look for the whole word to avoid partial matches (e.g., finding \"gen\" in \"gentleman\").\n6.  The very first time a match is found, that book is my answer because I am searching in canonical order. I will then print the name of that book and the play in which it was found and stop the search.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport sys\n\ndef find_first_bible_book_mention():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned\n    by name in a Shakespeare play.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    #
