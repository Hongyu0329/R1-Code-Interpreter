# Step 1: Define the Jones polynomial for the figure-eight knot and evaluate it.
# The Jones polynomial V(t) for the figure-eight knot is t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2.
# We need to evaluate this at t = -1 to find K.
t = -1

# Calculate each term of the polynomial
term1 = t**2
term2 = -t
term3 = 1
term4 = -(t**-1)
term5 = t**-2

# Sum the terms to get K
K = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5

# Step 2: Determine the range [1, |K|].
abs_K = abs(K)
# The range is from 1 to 5.

# Step 3 & 4: Analyze the Gödel numbering condition and conclude.
# A Gödel numbering G assigns a unique, very large natural number to every formula.
# This number is constructed from the codes of the formula's symbols (like '∀', '=', '0', '+', variables, etc.).
# For example, a simple statement like "0=0" is encoded as G("0=0"), which might be 2^code('=') * 3^code('0') * 5^code('0').
# Even for the simplest statements, and with the most efficient numbering schemes, the resulting Gödel number is an immense integer.
# It is a mathematical certainty that no Gödel number for any well-formed statement (let alone a "true Π₁ statement about prime twins") can be as small as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
# These small numbers would, at best, represent individual symbols, not complete statements.
# Therefore, the number of such Gödel numbers in the range [1, 5] is zero.
