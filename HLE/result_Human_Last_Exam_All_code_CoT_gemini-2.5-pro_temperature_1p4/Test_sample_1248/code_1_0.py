    # --- Part (a) ---
    # The question is: If g^2 . 1_R = 1_R and x^2 . 1_R in Z(R), does this imply x^j . r is symmetric for j >= 2?
    # The term 'symmetric' is ambiguous in this context. Without a precise definition, we cannot prove such a property.
    # The conditions are given on the action on the unit element 1_R, which do not necessarily constrain the action
    # on an arbitrary element r in R. For instance, the action of g on r could be arbitrary.
    # Therefore, the most logical answer is 'No'.
    ans_a = "No"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # The question is to find the value of x^2 a . 1_R when g . 1_R = 0 and q = -1.
    # To get a concrete answer, we assume the question intends a=1_H, so we calculate x^2 . 1_R.
    # Let w = x . 1_R. The formula is:
    # x^2 . 1_R = sum_{k=0 to 2} (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * C(2, k, q^-1) * w^(2-k) * (g^k . 1_R) * w^k
    # We are given g . 1_R = 0 and q = -1. We assume action associativity, so g^2 . 1_R = g . (g . 1_R) = g . 0 = 0.
    
    # Let's analyze the terms of the sum:
    # k=0: (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 * C(2,0) * w^2 * (g^0 . 1_R) * w^0 = 1 * 1 * 1 * w^2 * 1_R = w^2
    # k=1: The q-binomial coefficient C(n,k)_q = [n]_q! / ([k]_q! * [n-k]_q!). For q=-1, C(2,1) = [2]_{-1} / [1]_{-1} = (1+(-1))/(1) = 0.
    #      So, the k=1 term is 0.
    # k=2: (-1)^2 * (-1)^(-2(1)/2) * C(2,2) * w^0 * (g^2 . 1_R) * w^2 = 1 * (-1) * 1 * (0) * w^2 = 0.
    # The sum is w^2 + 0 + 0 = w^2.
    ans_b = "w^2"

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # The question is to express x^3 a . 1_R in terms of w, g, and a, given g . 1_R = 0 and w in Z(R).
    # Again, we assume a=1_H to find a simplified expression. We need to calculate x^3 . 1_R.
    # The formula is:
    # x^3 . 1_R = sum_{k=0 to 3} (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * C(3, k, q^-1) * w^(3-k) * (g^k . 1_R) * w^k
    # With g . 1_R = 0 and associativity, g^k . 1_R = 0 for all k >= 1.
    # Thus, the terms for k=1, 2, and 3 are all 0.
    
    # The only non-zero term is for k=0:
    # k=0: (-1)^0 * q^0 * C(3,0) * w^3 * (g^0 . 1_R) * w^0 = 1 * 1 * 1 * w^3 * 1_R = w^3
    # The condition that w is in the center Z(R) makes simplification slightly easier but isn't
    # strictly required for this result, as w^3 already commutes with 1_R.
    # The final expression is w^3.
    ans_c = "w^3"

    # Print the final combined answer as requested by the user format.
    # The expression for w^2 for part (b) involves the following equation based on the formula:
    # x^2 . 1_R = (1 * w^2 * (g^0 . 1_R)) + (0) + (0) = w^2
    # The expression for w^3 for part (c) involves the following equation:
    # x^3 . 1_R = (1 * w^3 * (g^0 . 1_R)) + (0) + (0) + (0) = w^3
