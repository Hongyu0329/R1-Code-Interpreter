    "Of course. Here is the scansion of the requested line.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The line provided is an \"iambic senarius,\" a common meter in Roman comedy. It consists of six feet, with the base foot being an iamb (Short-Long).\n2.  I will first identify any elisions, where a final vowel is dropped before a word starting with a vowel. In this line, `bene esse` elides to become `ben' esse`.\n3.  The meter allows for substitutions. I will identify feet that have been replaced by equivalents like a dactyl (Long-Short-Short), a spondee (Long-Long), or a tribrach (Short-Short-Short).\n4.  I will scan the line foot by foot, assigning 'L' for a long syllable and 'S' for a short syllable. The final syllable of the line is treated as long, a common poetic convention.\n5.  The final Python code will print out this analysis, showing each syllable under its corresponding 'L' or 'S' mark, with spaces separating the feet.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the provided Latin line and prints the metrical analysis.\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The line is an iambic senarius with several substitutions.\n    # 1. ben(e) esse -> Elision removes one syllable.\n    # 2. Final syllable of 'male' is treated as long (syllaba anceps).\n    # 3. Substitutions: Dactyl (LSS), Spondee (LL), Tribrach (SSS).\n\n    line = [\n        (\"et\", \"L\"), (\"ti\", \"S\"), (\"bi\", \"S\"),  # Foot 1: Dactyl (L S S)\n        (\"ben'\", \"S\"), (\"es\", \"L\"),              # Foot 2: Iamb (S L)\n        (\"se\", \"S\"), (\"so\", \"L\"),                # Foot 3: Iamb (S L)\n        (\"li\", \"L\"), (\"quom\", \"L\"),              # Foot 4: Spondee (L L)\n        (\"si\", \"S\"), (\"bi\", \"S\"), (\"sit\", \"S\"),  # Foot 5: Tribrach (S S S)\n        (\"ma\", \"S\"), (\"le\", \"L\")                 # Foot 6: Iamb (S L)\n    ]\n\n    feet_boundaries = [3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14]\n    \n    syllable_line = []\n    scansion_line = []\n    \n    for i, (syllable, mark) in enumerate(line):\n        syllable_line.append(syllable)\n        scansion_line.append(mark)\n        if (i + 1) in feet_boundaries and (i + 1) != len(line):\n            syllable_line.append(\"|\")\n            scansion_line.append(\"|\")\n\n    # To ensure proper alignment, we format the output\n    # Find the max width for each column\n    col_widths = [max(len(s), len(m)) for s, m in zip(syllable_line, scansion_line)]\n\n    # Build the formatted strings\n    formatted_syllables = \" \".join([syllable.center(col_widths[i]) for i, syllable in enumerate(syllable_line)])\n    formatted_scansion = \" \".join([mark.center(col_widths[i]) for i, mark in enumerate(scansion_line)])\n\n    print(\"Scansion of the line:\")\n    print(\"\\\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(formatted_syllables)\n    print(formatted_scansion)\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L S S | S L | S L | L L | S S S | S L>>>"
