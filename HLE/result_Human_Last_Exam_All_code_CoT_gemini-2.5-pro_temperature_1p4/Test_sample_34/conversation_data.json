    "This is a poker theory question that can be answered using Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Context:** The scenario is a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game. We are opening from the button (BTN), which is the most powerful position, allowing for the widest range of opening hands. The raise size is a standard 2.5x the big blind.\n2.  **Define \"Worst Suited Jack\":** The question asks for the \"worst\" suited jack that you *should* open. This implies we are looking for the hand that is a standard, profitable open-raise but has the lowest Expected Value (EV) among all suited jack combinations.\n3.  **Analyze Suited Jacks:** The suited jack hands are J2s, J3s, J4s, J5s, J6s, J7s, J8s, J9s, JTs, JQs, and JKs. According to standard GTO pre-flop charts for this scenario, all of these hands are profitable opens from the button.\n4.  **Determine Lowest EV:** The value of these hands is derived from high-card strength and connectivity (ability to make straights). The hand with the lowest kicker (the '2' in J2s) will generally have the lowest value when it does not make a flush or straight. J2s has the lowest kicker and the worst connectivity among all suited jacks. Therefore, it has the lowest EV while still being a profitable open.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A simple Python script will be created to state this answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n    In Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker, the button is the most profitable position,\n    and a player should open-raise a very wide range of hands. This range includes all\n    suited Jack combinations (from J2s to JKs).\n\n    The \"worst\" of these hands is the one with the lowest Expected Value (EV) that is\n    still a standard, profitable open. A hand's value comes from its high card strength\n    and its connectivity (the ability to make straights).\n\n    Comparing all suited jacks:\n    - JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s are strong hands due to high cards and/or excellent connectivity.\n    - The remaining hands (J8s down to J2s) decrease in value as the kicker gets lower.\n    - J2s has the lowest kicker and the poorest connectivity.\n\n    Therefore, J2s is the suited jack with the lowest EV that should still be opened\n    from the button in this scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n    worst_hand = \"J2s\"\n    print(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB rake-free cash game is: {worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_to_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
