    "Here is a plan to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source:** First, I will establish the origin of our current word, \"sister.\" It comes from Old Norse \"systir,\" which replaced the native Old English word due to the Viking invasions.\n2.  **Find the Original Word:** I will identify the original Old English word for sister, which was \"sweostor.\" This is the word that would have evolved.\n3.  **Trace the Evolution:** I will trace the likely linguistic path of \"sweostor\" into Modern English. This involves applying known patterns of sound and spelling changes that occurred between Old English, Middle English, and Modern English. I'll also look at cognates (related words) in other Germanic languages like German (\"Schwester\") and Dutch (\"zuster\") that followed a similar, uninterrupted evolution from the same Proto-Germanic root.\n4.  **Present the Conclusion:** Based on this linguistic path, I will present the most probable modern form of \"sweostor.\"\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the linguistic history and hypothetical evolution\n    of the word for \"sister\" in English.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The current word comes from Old Norse\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n\n    # The original Old English word that was replaced\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    # The hypothetical Modern English word, based on natural evolution\n    hypothetical_modern_english_word = \"swester\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Origin of 'Sister'\")\n    print(f\"The current Modern English word 'sister' is a loanword from Old Norse.\")\n    print(f\"It comes from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}', which replaced the native word during the period of Norse settlement in England.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The Original Anglo-Saxon Word\")\n    print(f\"Before the Norse influence, the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"This word shares a common ancestor with words in other Germanic languages, like German 'Schwester' and Dutch 'zuster'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Hypothetical Evolution\")\n    print(f\"If the word '{old_english_word}' had not been replaced, it would have evolved naturally into Modern English.\")\n    print(f\"Following known linguistic patterns (like the simplification of the 'eo' diphthong and standardization of spelling), its likely modern form would be '{hypothetical_modern_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Conclusion: The Hypothetical Word\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, if the Norse had never invaded, the Modern English word for 'sister' would likely be:\")\n    print(f\"'{hypothetical_modern_english_word}'\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
