    "To find the smallest number `n` such that a set of `n` elements with a binary operation is not a group, we need to check values of `n` starting from the smallest possible size.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  In standard group theory, a group is defined on a non-empty set. Therefore, we will search for the smallest positive integer `n`. We'll start our search from `n=1`.\n2.  For each `n`, we will determine if it's possible to define a binary operation on a set of `n` elements that fails to form a group. A binary operation on a set of `n` elements can be represented by an `n x n` Cayley table (multiplication table).\n3.  For `n=1`, there is only one possible binary operation on the set `G={a}`, which is `a . a = a`. This structure forms a group (the trivial group). So, for `n=1`, any binary operation results in a group.\n4.  For `n=2`, we can represent the set as `G={0, 1}`. There are `2^(2*2) = 16` possible binary operations. We need to check if at least one of these 16 operations results in a non-group. We can do this by defining an operation and checking if it violates any of the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity element, inverse element).\n5.  I will write a Python script to automate this search. The script will start from `n=1`, generate all possible binary operations for that `n`, and for each operation, check if it forms a group. The first `n` for which a non-group structure is found will be our answer.\n6.  The script will then print this smallest `n`, along with an example of such a non-group structure, its operation table, and a specific equation showing why it fails to be a group.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_group(n, table_1d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given binary operation on a set of size n forms a group.\n    The operation is given as a flattened Cayley table.\n    Returns a tuple (is_group_bool, reason_str).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return (False, \"The set is empty, so it cannot contain an identity element.\")\n\n    table = [table_1d[i*n : (i+1)*n] for i in range(n)]\n\n    # 1.
