    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we will analyze it by representing the complex number $z$ as $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**1. Expressing the equation in terms of x and y:**\n\n*   The left-hand side (LHS) is:\n    $z \\cdot i = (x + iy) \\cdot i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + xi$.\n\n*   The right-hand side (RHS) uses the definition of complex exponentiation, $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$:\n    $i^z = e^{z \\ln i}$.\n    The complex logarithm $\\ln i$ is multi-valued. In polar form, $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\ln i = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n    Substituting this into the expression for $i^z$:\n    $i^z = e^{(x+iy) \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{(xi - y)(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\n*   Equating the LHS and RHS:\n    $-y + xi = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\left( \\cos\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)\\right) + i \\sin\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)\\right) \\right)$.\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts gives a system of two equations. However, it's simpler to analyze specific cases for $z$.\n\n**2. Case 1: Real solutions (y = 0)**\n\nIf $y=0$, then $z=x$. The original equation becomes $x \\cdot i = i^x$.\n*   $i^x = e^{x \\ln i} = e^{x \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = \\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)) + i \\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$.\n*   Equating $xi$ with this expression:\n    *   Real part: $0 = \\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$\n    *   Imaginary part: $x = \\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$\n*   From the real part, we must have $\\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)) = \\pm 1$.\n*   Substituting this into the imaginary part gives $x = \\pm 1$.\n*   Let's check these values:\n    *   If $z=1$: LHS = $1 \\cdot i = i$. RHS = $i^1 = i$. This is a solution.\n    *   If $z=-1$: LHS = $-1 \\cdot i = -i$. RHS = $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This is also a solution.\n    So, $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are two solutions.\n\n**3. Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions (x = 0)**\n\nIf $x=0$, then $z=iy$. The original equation becomes $(iy) \\cdot i = i^{iy}$.\n*   LHS: $i^2y = -y$.\n*   RHS: $i^{iy} = e^{iy \\ln i} = e^{iy \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n*   So, the equation is $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$. Let $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n    The equation is $-y = e^{-yA_k}$.\n    *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $A_k > 0$. An analysis shows that the equation $Y = e^{-YA_k}$ has no real solutions for $Y$.\n    *   If $k < 0$, let $k = -m$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. Then $A_{-m} < 0$. Let $B_m = -A_{-m} = \\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2} > 0$. The equation becomes $-y = e^{yB_m}$. This equation has a unique real solution for $y$ for each positive integer $m$. The solution can be expressed using the Lambert W function, defined by $W(c)e^{W(c)}=c$. The solution for $y$ is $y_m = -\\frac{W(B_m)}{B_m}$.\n\nThis gives an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions. We can compute them numerically.\n\n**4. General Case (x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0)**\n\nWhile it's difficult to prove rigorously that no other solutions exist, explorations of the system of equations derived from the real and imaginary parts suggest that the solutions found in the special cases are the only ones.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate the two real solutions and the first few purely imaginary solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_z_i_eq_iz():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for z in the complex equation z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The equation z*i = i^z has two real solutions and an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions.\")\n    \n    # Real solutions\n    print(\"\\nReal solutions:\")\n    z1 = 1.0\n    z2 = -1.0\n    print(f\"z = {z1} + 0.0i\")\n    print(f\"z = {z2} + 0.0i\")\n    \n    # Purely imaginary solutions\n    print(\"\\nPurely imaginary solutions of the form z = iy:\")\n    print(\"The solutions are of the form z_m = i * y_m for m = 1, 2, 3, ...\")\n    print(\"where y_m = -W((4m-1)pi/2) / ((4m-1)pi/2)\")\n    print(\"W is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst 5 purely imaginary solutions:\")\n    \n    for m in range(1, 6):\n        # B_m = (4m-1)pi/2\n        # We pass it as a complex number to ensure numerical stability in the library functions.\n        B_m = complex((4 * m - 1) * np.pi / 2, 0)\n        \n        # Calculate the Lambert W function for B_m\n        W_Bm = lambertw(B_m, k=0)\n        \n        # Calculate y_m\n        y_m = -W_Bm / B_m\n        \n        # The solution is z_m = i * y_m\n        z_m = 1j * y_m\n        \n        # Outputting the numbers in the final form\n        # The imaginary part of z_m will be the real part of y_m\n        print(f\"For m={m}, z_{m} = {z_m.real:.6f} + {z_m.imag:.6f}i\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_z_i_eq_iz()\n```\n<<<z=1, z=-1, and $z_m = \\frac{-2i}{(4m-1)\\pi} W_0\\left(\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}\\right)$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$>>>"
