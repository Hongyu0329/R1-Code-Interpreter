    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring R = Z/8Z.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  A quadratic form in two variables `x` and `y` over Z/8Z is a polynomial `Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where the coefficients `a, b, c` are in Z/8Z = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.\n2.  Two quadratic forms, `Q` and `Q'`, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation `T` such that `Q'(v) = Q(T(v))` for all vectors `v = (x, y)`. A transformation `T` is a 2x2 matrix with entries in Z/8Z whose determinant is a unit in Z/8Z (i.e., odd: 1, 3, 5, or 7).\n3.  The total number of possible quadratic forms is `8 * 8 * 8 = 512`. Manually simplifying all of them is a very complex task.\n4.  A more systematic approach is to use a computer to classify these forms. We can iterate through all 512 possible forms and compute a set of mathematical invariants for each.\n5.  Invariants are properties of a quadratic form that do not change under an invertible linear transformation. If two forms have different invariants, they cannot be in the same equivalence class. Key invariants include:\n    *   The discriminant: `D = b^2 - 4ac` (mod 8).\n    *   The set of values the form can produce on \"primitive vectors\". A vector `(x,y)` is primitive if its components are not both from the ideal `2Z/8Z`, which simply means `x` or `y` must be odd. Let's call this set `V_p`.\n6.  By computing a signature for each form (e.g., a tuple containing its invariants), we can group the forms with identical signatures. The number of unique signatures provides the number of equivalence classes (assuming these invariants are sufficient to distinguish all classes, which is often the case for these rings).\n7.  The final step is to write a Python script to perform this calculation and output the result. The script will:\n    *   Loop through all possible `a, b, c` from 0 to 7.\n    *   For each form, calculate its signature (invariants).\n    *   Use a dictionary or a set to store the unique signatures found.\n    *   The final number of unique signatures will be the number of equivalence classes.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to store unique classes, with the invariant tuple as key.\n    # The value will be a representative form (a, b, c) for that class.\n    classes = collections.OrderedDict()\n\n    # Iterate through all possible quadratic forms Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2\n    for a in range(8):\n        for b in range(8):\n            for c in range(8):\n                # Calculate invariants for the form (a, b, c).\n                \n                # 1. The discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac (mod 8)\n                discriminant = (b*b - 4*a*c) % 8\n\n                # 2.
