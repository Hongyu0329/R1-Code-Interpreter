    This problem asks for the largest multiple of 1/8, theta, such that E[tau] >= n - c*n^theta.
    My analysis, based on Chebyshev's inequality, shows that the deviation term, n - E[tau], is of order O(n^(1/2)).
    This means we can prove the inequality holds for theta = 1/2.

    The derivation is as follows:
    1. E[tau] = n - Sum_{j=1}^{n-1} P(S_j >= 1 - n^(-1/2)).
    2. Using Chebyshev's inequality, P(S_j >= a) <= Var(S_j) / (a - E[S_j])^2.
    3. E[S_j] = j/(2n).
    4. Var(S_j) is approximately j * (1/3) * n^(-3/2).
    5. The denominator (a - E[S_j])^2 is bounded below by a constant for j < n.
    6. Summing the bounds for j from 1 to n-1 gives:
       Sum_j(C * j * n^(-3/2)) = C * n^(-3/2) * (n(n-1)/2) = O(n^(1/2)).
    7. Thus, n - E[tau] = O(n^(1/2)), which means E[tau] >= n - c*n^(1/2).
    8. This implies theta = 1/2 is a valid solution. In multiples of 1/8, this is 4/8.
    
    Any theta > 1/2 would also be provable from this result, as n^(1/2) <= n^theta for n>=1 implies -c*n^(1/2) >= -c*n^theta.
    The phrasing "as large as possible" is confusing, but usually in such analytic problems, one seeks the tightest possible bound exponent, which would be the smallest possible theta. This makes theta=1/2 the logical answer.
