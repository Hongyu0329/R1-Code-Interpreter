    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the pattern in the sequence.\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.**\n    Let the sequence be `a_n`. The given terms are:\n    `a_1 = 2`\n    `a_2 = 11`\n    `a_3 = 23`\n    `a_4 = 51`\n    `a_5 = 119`\n\n    Let's check for a pattern of the form `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n`, as the terms are approximately doubling.\n    -   For `n=1`: `a_2 = 2 * a_1 + c_1` => `11 = 2 * 2 + c_1` => `c_1 = 7`.\n    -   For `n=2`: `a_3 = 2 * a_2 + c_2` => `23 = 2 * 11 + c_2` => `c_2 = 1`.\n    -   For `n=3`: `a_4 = 2 * a_3 + c_3` => `51 = 2 * 23 + c_3` => `c_3 = 5`.\n    -   For `n=4`: `a_5 = 2 * a_4 + c_4` => `119 = 2 * 51 + c_4` => `c_4 = 17`.\n\n2.  **Find the pattern in the added sequence `c_n`.**\n    The sequence of added numbers `c_n` is `7, 1, 5, 17, ...`. The first term, 7, seems anomalous. Let's analyze the sequence starting from the second term `c_2`. Let's call this new sequence `k_m`.\n    `k_1 = c_2 = 1`\n    `k_2 = c_3 = 5`\n    `k_3 = c_4 = 17`\n\n3.  **Analyze the sequence `k_m = 1, 5, 17, ...`**\n    Let's find the differences between consecutive terms in `k_m`.\n    -   `k_2 - k_1 = 5 - 1 = 4`\n    -   `k_3 - k_2 = 17 - 5 = 12`\n    The differences are `4, 12, ...`.\n\n4.  **Identify the pattern in the differences.**\n    The sequence of differences `4, 12, ...` appears to be a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 (`12 / 4 = 3`).\n    -   The next difference should be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the next term in `k_m`.**\n    -   The next term, `k_4`, would be `k_3 + 36` => `17 + 36 = 53`.\n    -   This means the next term in the `c_n` sequence, `c_5`, is 53.\n\n6.  **Calculate the next term in the original sequence `a_n`.**\n    The next term, `a_6`, is calculated using the established pattern:\n    `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + c_5`\n    `a_6 = 2 * 119 + 53`\n    `a_6 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the next number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle.\n    The sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\n\n    Step-by-step analysis:\n    1. The pattern is assumed to be a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n.\n    2. We calculate the sequence c_n starting from the second term.\n    3. We find the pattern within the sequence c_n to predict its next term.\n    4. Finally, we calculate the next term of the original sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    # Step 1: Find the sequence c_n for n >= 2\n    # The relationship is a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_{n+1}\n    # We will analyze the pattern from the third term of 'a'\n    # a[2] = 2*a[1] + c_2 => 23 = 2*11 + c_2\n    c = []\n    for i in range(1, len(a) - 1):\n        c_val = a[i+1] - 2 * a[i]\n        c.append(c_val)\n\n    # c is now [1, 5, 17]\n\n    # Step 2: Find the pattern in c\n    # The differences are:\n    diffs_c = []\n    for i in range(len(c) - 1):\n        diff = c[i+1] - c[i]\n        diffs_c.append(diff)\n    \n    # diffs_c is [4, 12]\n\n    # Step 3: Assume the differences form a geometric progression\n    ratio = diffs_c[1] / diffs_c[0]  # 12 / 4 = 3\n    next_diff = diffs_c[-1] * ratio\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the next term in c\n    next_c = c[-1] + next_diff\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the next term in a\n    next_a = 2 * a[-1] + next_c\n    \n    print(\"The pattern is that each term is twice the previous term plus an increasing number.\")\n    print(\"Sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\")\n    print(\"23 = 2 * 11 + 1\")\n    print(\"51 = 2 * 23 + 5\")\n    print(\"119 = 2 * 51 + 17\")\n    print(\"The added numbers are 1, 5, 17.
