    # Part (a): Can F and G contain multisets with disjoint supports if they are sum maximal?
    # Based on the structure of sum-maximal cross-1-intersecting families (F=G=F_x),
    # any two multisets within F must share the element x. Thus, their supports
    # cannot be disjoint.

    # Part (b): If k=2 and m=5, what is |F|+|G| for sum-maximal families?

    # Part (c): Must F necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a fixed element?

    # containing some fixed element x.
