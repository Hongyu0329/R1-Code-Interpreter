# Based on the analysis of the nonlinear boundary value problem, the condition
# for the existence of solutions on the initial values (x0, y0, z0) is that
# they must lie on a sphere defined by the equation:
# x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = R^2

# From the problem's parameters and solvability conditions, we derived the value of R^2.
# The given condition is: alpha + beta + gamma = 10^25 * (1 - exp(-T))
# The derived sum of solvability conditions is:
# alpha + beta + gamma = 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2) * (1 - exp(-T))
# Equating these leads to:
# 10^25 = 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2)
# Therefore, R^2 = x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = 10^25 / 2.

R_squared_numerator = 10**25
R_squared_denominator = 2
R_squared = R_squared_numerator / R_squared_denominator

# The problem asks for the area of the surface defined by these values,
# which corresponds to the surface area of the sphere.
# The formula for the surface area of a sphere is A = 4 * pi * R^2.

four = 4
pi_val = math.pi

# Calculate the area
area = four * pi_val * R_squared

# Output the components of the final calculation and the result
