    Analyzes the statements about two-channel quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is based on the relationships between the potential V(r), the Jost matrix F(E),
    and the scattering matrix S(E).
    - Statement 1 is correct because the symmetries of the S-matrix reflect the symmetries of the potential.
    - Statement 2 is incorrect due to a counterexample (rotated identical channels).
    - Statement 3 is correct because the Jost matrix, like the S-matrix, must reflect the symmetries of the potential.
    - Statement 4 is incorrect due to a counterexample where a nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E)
      can lead to a diagonal S-matrix (e.g., S(E) = -I).
    - Statement 5 is incorrect because a diagonal F(E) implies a diagonalizable S(E), which in turn
      implies a diagonalizable V(r).
