# Plan:
# 1. Define the number of choices for placing each element from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#    into the chain of subsets, according to the given constraints.
# 2. The number of choices for an element 'i' is determined by the constraint
#    'i' in S_i, or the lack thereof.
#    An element 'x' is in S_k if and only if it belongs to one of the regions
#    S_1, S_2\S_1, ..., S_k\S_{k-1}.
# 3. Multiply these numbers together to get the total number of possible
#    set tuples.
# 4. Print the final calculation and the result.

# Number of choices for placing element 1
# Constraint: 1 in S_1. It can only be in the region S_1.
choices_for_1 = 1

# Number of choices for placing element 2
# Constraint: 2 in S_2. It can be in S_1 or S_2 \ S_1.
choices_for_2 = 2

# Number of choices for placing element 3
# Constraint: 3 in S_3. It can be in S_1, S_2 \ S_1, or S_3 \ S_2.
choices_for_3 = 3

# Number of choices for placing element 4
# No constraint. It can be in S_1, S_2 \ S_1, S_3 \ S_2, S_4 \ S_3, or {1,2,3,4,5} \ S_4.
choices_for_4 = 5

# Number of choices for placing element 5
# No constraint. It has the same 5 choices as element 4.
choices_for_5 = 5

# The total number of sets is the product of the choices for each element.
total_number_of_sets = choices_for_1 * choices_for_2 * choices_for_3 * choices_for_4 * choices_for_5

# Print the final equation with each number included.
print(f"The calculation for the total number of sets is:")
print(f"{choices_for_1} * {choices_for_2} * {choices_for_3} * {choices_for_4} * {choices_for_5} = {total_number_of_sets}")
