    "In crystallography, the wallpaper groups are the 17 possible two-dimensional plane symmetry groups. They are classified by their point groups, which describe the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern. The order of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations in it.\n\nMy plan to find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is as follows:\n1.  I will first list the 10 possible point groups for 2D crystals.\n2.  I will determine the order of each of these point groups.\n3.  I will identify which of these point groups have an order of 2. The relevant point groups are C2 (2-fold rotation) and D1 (reflection, also denoted as 'm').\n4.  I will then list and count the wallpaper groups associated with each of these point groups.\n    *   For point group C2, there is one wallpaper group: `p2`.\n    *   For point group D1, there are three wallpaper groups: `pm`, `pg`, and `cm`.\n5.  Finally, I will sum these counts to get the total number and present it as an equation.\n\nThe following Python code systematically implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group\n    of a specific order and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each wallpaper group to its point group and the order of that point group.\n    # Point group D1 is often just denoted by 'm' for mirror.\n    wallpaper_groups_info = {\n        \"p1\":   {\"point_group\": \"C1\", \"order\": 1},\n        \"p2\":   {\"point_group\": \"C2\", \"order\": 2},\n        \"pm\":   {\"point_group\": \"D1\", \"order\": 2},\n        \"pg\":   {\"point_group\": \"D1\", \"order\": 2},\n        \"cm\":   {\"point_group\": \"D1\", \"order\": 2},\n        \"p2mm\": {\"point_group\": \"D2\", \"order\": 4},\n        \"p2mg\": {\"point_group\": \"D2\", \"order\": 4},\n        \"p2gg\": {\"point_group\": \"D2\", \"order\": 4},\n        \"c2mm\": {\"point_group\": \"D2\", \"order\": 4},\n        \"p3\":   {\"point_group\": \"C3\", \"order\": 3},\n        \"p3m1\": {\"point_group\": \"D3\", \"order\": 6},\n        \"p31m\": {\"point_group\": \"D3\", \"order\": 6},\n        \"p4\":   {\"point_group\": \"C4\", \"order\": 4},\n        \"p4mm\": {\"point_group\": \"D4\", \"order\": 8},\n        \"p4gm\": {\"point_group\": \"D4\", \"order\": 8},\n        \"p6\":   {\"point_group\": \"C6\", \"order\": 6},\n        \"p6mm\": {\"point_group\": \"D6\", \"order\": 12},\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Group the wallpaper groups by their point group if their order matches the target.\n    groups_by_point_group = {}\n    for group_name, data in wallpaper_groups_info.items():\n        if data[\"order\"] == target_order:\n            point_group = data[\"point_group\"]\n            if point_group not in groups_by_point_group:\n                groups_by_point_group[point_group] = []\n            groups_by_point_group[point_group].append(group_name)\n    \n    print(f\"Finding wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order}:\")\n    \n    counts = []\n    # Print the breakdown of groups found for each relevant point group.\n    for point_group, group_list in sorted(groups_by_point_group.items()):\n        count = len(group_list)\n        counts.append(count)\n        print(f\" - Point group {point_group} has {count} wallpaper group(s): {', '.join(group_list)}\")\n        \n    total_count = sum(counts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe total number is the sum of these counts.\")\n    print(\"Final equation:\")\n    \n    # Construct and print the final equation.\n    equation_parts = [str(c) for c in counts]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
