    print("\nStep 1: Understanding the Premise")
    print_wrapped("The question begins with a premise: 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)...'.")
    print_wrapped("An 'existentially forgeable' scheme is one where an attacker can create a valid signature for at least one message they haven't seen signed before. By definition, such a scheme is insecure.")
    print_wrapped("However, standard ECDSA is designed to be 'existentially UNforgeable', the standard security definition for a secure signature scheme. This makes the premise contradictory.")
    print_wrapped("Given this confusion, the best approach is to evaluate the truth of each statement on its own cryptographic merits.")

    print("\nStep 2: Evaluating Each Statement")

    # --- Analysis of A ---
    print("\n--- Option A ---")
    print_wrapped("Statement A: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print_wrapped("This property is known as 'strong unforgeability'. It means it's computationally infeasible to create a second, different signature for a message that has already been signed. Secure implementations of ECDSA are designed to have this property. Therefore, the statement that an adversary's success probability is 'no more than negligible' is correct.")
    print("Verdict for A: TRUE")

    # --- Analysis of B ---
    print("\n--- Option B ---")
    print_wrapped("Statement B: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print_wrapped("This refers to the core security assumption of public-key cryptography. The security of ECDSA relies on the computational difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Recovering the secret key 'sk' from public information is infeasible for a computationally bounded adversary. The statement is a correct description of ECDSA's security.")
    print("Verdict for B: TRUE")

    # --- Analysis of C ---
    print("\n--- Option C ---")
    print_wrapped("Statement C: 'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print_wrapped("This statement describes 'universal forgery' (being able to sign a specific message 'm' chosen by someone else). It claims that SOME existentially forgeable (i.e., insecure) schemes are vulnerable to this attack. This is true. For example, a scheme where the private key is easily recovered from the public key would be both existentially and universally forgeable. A trivially broken scheme (e.g., where the signature is always the same constant) would also satisfy this.")
    print("Verdict for C: TRUE")

    # --- Analysis of D ---
    print("\n--- Option D ---")
    print_wrapped("Statement D: 'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print_wrapped("This statement claims that message recovery is hard for ALL existentially forgeable schemes. This is false. First, message confidentiality is not a goal for most signature schemes; the verification algorithm often requires the message 'm' as input. Second, the claim is for 'all' such schemes, which is too strong; it's easy to design an insecure scheme where the message can be recovered from the signature.")
    print("Verdict for D: FALSE")

    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion")
    print_wrapped("We have evaluated each statement:")
    print("- A is TRUE.")
    print("- B is TRUE.")
    print("- C is TRUE.")
    print("- D is FALSE.")
    print_wrapped("Since statements A, B, and C are all true, more than one of the options are true.")
