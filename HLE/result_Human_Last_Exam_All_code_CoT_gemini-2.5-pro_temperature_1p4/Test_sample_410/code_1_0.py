# Step 1: Define the function f(x) based on the given conditions.
# The conditions lim_{x->-inf} (f(x)+3)/exp(x) = 1 and f(ln(2)) = 0
# uniquely determine the function's coefficients.
# As derived in the plan, c=-3, b=1, and a=1/4.
a_f, b_f, c_f = sp.Rational(1, 4), 1, -3
x = sp.Symbol('x')
f_x = a_f * sp.exp(2*x) + b_f * sp.exp(x) + c_f

print(f"The function f(x) is determined to be: {f_x}")

# Step 2: Use the integral equation property to find the relation between a and b.
# The property implies a = f(ln(b)).
# This problem has a unique solution, which suggests we should test special values
# provided in the problem statement. A natural choice is b=2, making ln(b) = ln(2).
a_val, b_val = sp.Symbol('a'), sp.Symbol('b')
b_val = 2

# Step 3: Calculate 'a' using the relation a = f(ln(b)) with b=2.
# a = f(ln(2)), and we are given f(ln(2)) = 0.
a_val = f_x.subs(x, sp.ln(b_val))

print(f"From the integral equation, we find the values a = {a_val} and b = {b_val}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the final sum a + b.
final_sum = a_val + b_val
print(f"The final sum is a + b = {a_val} + {b_val} = {final_sum}.")
