# This script determines the complexity class for a randomized MIS algorithm
# on three types of graphs. The analysis is theoretical.

# Let f_1(n), f_2(n), and f_3(n) be the number of steps for the algorithm to
# terminate with probability 1 - 1/n on a cycle, a tree of degree <= 100,
# and a general graph of degree <= 100, respectively.

# 1. General analysis for bounded-degree graphs:
# For any graph with maximum degree D, the probability that an edge is removed
# in a step is at least 2/(D+1), a constant. This implies that the number of
# edges decreases exponentially, leading to an O(log n) running time with
# high probability.

# 2. Lower bound:
# For a path graph (which is a tree and a bounded-degree graph), it is known
# that this algorithm requires Omega(log n) steps.

# 3. Conclusion for all cases:
# Since all three graph classes are degree-bounded and contain paths as
# possible instances, the complexity is tightly bounded by Theta(log n).

# f_1(n) for a cycle (D=2) is Theta(log n).
# f_2(n) for a tree (D<=100) is Theta(log n).
# f_3(n) for a general graph (D<=100) is Theta(log n).

# 4. Mapping Theta(log n) to the given categories:
# The complexity f(n) = Theta(log n) implies f(n) = Omega(log n).
# This falls into category 9.

d1 = 9  # for f_1(n)
d2 = 9  # for f_2(n)
d3 = 9  # for f_3(n)

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final "equation".
# Since this is a theoretical problem, we print the reasoning and the result.
