    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Set up the mathematical equations.**\n    A right triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c` follows the Pythagorean theorem: `a² + b² = c²`.\n    The area `A` is given by `A = (1/2) * a * b`.\n    We are given that the sides are rational and the area `A = 263`. This gives us the equation `a * b = 526`.\n\n2.  **Parameterize the sides.**\n    Any right triangle with rational sides can be scaled from a primitive Pythagorean triple `(x, y, z)` where `x`, `y`, `z` are integers with no common factors, `x² + y² = z²`.\n    The sides of our triangle can be written as `a = k*x`, `b = k*y`, `c = k*z` for some rational number `k`.\n    Substituting these into the area equation: `(1/2) * (kx) * (ky) = 263`, which simplifies to `k² * xy = 526`.\n\n3.  **Find the scaling factor `k`.**\n    From the previous step, `k² = 526 / (xy)`. For `k` to be rational, `526 / (xy)` must be a perfect square of a rational number.\n    This means `526 * xy` must be a perfect square of an integer.\n    A primitive Pythagorean triple `(x, y, z)` can be generated by Euclid's formula using two coprime integers `m > n` of opposite parity:\n    `x = m² - n²`\n    `y = 2mn`\n    `z = m² + n²`\n    So, `xy = (m² - n²)(2mn) = 2mn(m-n)(m+n)`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the core Diophantine equation.**\n    Substituting `xy` into the condition for `k` gives: `526 * (2mn(m-n)(m+n))` must be a perfect square.\n    `2 * 263 * 2mn(m-n)(m+n) = 4 * 263 * mn(m-n)(m+n)` must be a square.\n    This implies that `263 * mn(m-n)(m+n)` must be a perfect square. Let's call this `263 * j²`.\n\n5.  **Solve for `m` and `n`.**\n    Since `m, n, m-n, m+n` are pairwise coprime, for their product multiplied by 263 to be a square, one of the factors must contain the prime factor 263. Let's say one factor is `263 * s²` and the other three factors are perfect squares. This leads to a set of Diophantine equations that need to be solved. A search for the smallest integers `m` and `n` that satisfy this condition is required.\n\n6.  **Calculate the hypotenuse and its denominator.**\n    Once we find a suitable `(m, n)` pair, we can find `j`.\n    The scaling factor `k` is `k = sqrt(526 / xy) = sqrt(263 / (mn(m²-n²))) = sqrt(263 / (263 * j²)) = 1/j`.\n    The hypotenuse is `c = k * z = (1/j) * (m² + n²)`.\n    The denominator of `c` will be `j / gcd(j, m² + n²)`. The goal is to find the smallest possible value for this denominator.\n\nInstead of solving the complex Diophantine equations by hand, I will write a Python script to search for the smallest `m` and `n` that satisfy the condition from step 4, and then calculate the resulting denominator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches for the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse\n    of a right triangle with area 263 and rational sides.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_denominator = float('inf')\n    found_solution = None\n\n    # Search for a pair of integers (m, n) that generates a primitive Pythagorean triple.\n    # m > n > 0, m and n are coprime and have opposite parity.\n    # The condition derived is that `263 * m * n * (m - n) * (m + n)` must be a perfect square.\n    # This means `m * n * (m - n) * (m + n)` must be of the form `263 * j^2`.\n    \n    # We search for the (m, n) pair that produces the smallest denominator for the hypotenuse c.\n    # The hypotenuse c is given by (m^2 + n^2) / j, so its denominator is j / gcd(j, m^2 + n^2).\n    # We check a reasonable range for m.\n    \n    limit = 500\n    for m in range(2, limit):\n        for n in range(1, m):\n            # Condition for generating a primitive Pythagorean triple\n            if (m % 2 == n % 2) or (math.gcd(m, n) != 1):\n                continue\n\n            product = m * n * (m - n) * (m + n)\n            \n            # The product must be of the form 263 * j^2\n            if product % 263 == 0:\n                j_squared = product // 263\n                j = math.isqrt(j_squared)\n\n                if j * j == j_squared:\n                    # We found a valid (m, n) pair.\n                    # Now, calculate the hypotenuse and its denominator.\n                    z = m*m + n*n\n                    \n                    denominator = j // math.gcd(j, z)\n                    \n                    if denominator < min_denominator:\n                        min_denominator = denominator\n                        found_solution = (m, n, j, z, denominator)\n\n    if found_solution:\n        m, n, j, z, denominator = found_solution\n        print(f\"A solution is found with integers m={m}, n={n}.\")\n        print(f\"The product m*n*(m^2-n^2) is {m * n * (m*m - n*n)}.\")\n        print(f\"This product is equal to 263 * j^2, where j = {j}.\")\n        print(f\"The hypotenuse z of the base Pythagorean triple is m^2 + n^2 = {z}.\")\n        print(f\"The hypotenuse of the triangle with area 263 is c = z / j = {z} / {j}.\")\n        print(f\"The smallest possible denominator is {j} / gcd({j}, {z}) = {denominator}.\")\n    else:\n        # Fallback if the search limit is too small.
