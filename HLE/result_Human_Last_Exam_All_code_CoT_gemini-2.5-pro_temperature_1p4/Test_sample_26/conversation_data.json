    "My plan to solve this problem involves a sequence of steps based on fundamental theorems in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the space X:** A smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface, which corresponds to a compact, oriented real 4-dimensional manifold.\n2.  **Determine the first homotopy group $\\pi_1(X)$:** I will use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy groups. This theorem relates the homotopy groups of a submanifold to those of the ambient projective space. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, this will show that $X$ is also simply connected.\n3.  **Determine the third Betti number $b_3(X)$:** I will use Poincaré Duality, which relates the Betti numbers of a compact, oriented manifold. Specifically, for our 4-manifold $X$, it states that $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$. Since $b_1(X)$ is the rank of $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, and $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, we can conclude that $b_1(X)=0$, and therefore $b_3(X)=0$.\n4.  **Relate homotopy to homology:** I will use the Rational Hurewicz Theorem. Since $X$ is simply connected, this theorem states that the rank of the k-th homotopy group is equal to the k-th Betti number for all $k \\geq 2$.\n5.  **Combine the results:** By combining the results from the previous steps, I will find that the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to $b_3(X)$, which is 0.\n\nThe python code below will walk through these steps and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\n    This function explains the theoretical steps and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Goal: Find the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) of a smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Properties of X and its first homotopy group pi_1(X)\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the first homotopy group of X using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\")\n    # X is a complex hypersurface in CP^3, so its complex dimension is 2.\n    dim_C_X = 2\n    # The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy states that for a smooth complex subvariety X of CP^n,\n    # the inclusion i: X -> CP^n induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups pi_k(X) -> pi_k(CP^n) for k < dim_C(X).\n    # Here n=3 and dim_C(X)=2, so the isomorphism holds for k=1.\n    # Therefore, pi_1(X) is isomorphic to pi_1(CP^3).\n    # The homotopy groups of complex projective spaces are well known.
