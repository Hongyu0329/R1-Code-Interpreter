# Step 1 & 2: Analysis of periodicity.
# The matrix M is a rotation by 2*pi/3, so M^3 = I.
# The recurrence is x_{n+1} = M*x_n + b.
# It can be shown that x_{n+3} = x_n, so the sequence is periodic with period 3.
# The expression to be found, E_n, is also periodic with period 3.

# Step 3: Simplify the target expression.
# We need to evaluate the expression for n = 10^15.
# 10^15 mod 3 = (10 mod 3)^15 mod 3 = 1^15 mod 3 = 1.
# So we need to find the value for n=1.
# The expression for n=1 is E_1 = (x_1^1 - (3*r/(2*pi))*sin(2*pi/3))^2 + (x_1^2)^2.
# Let b be the constant vector in the recurrence: b = [3*sqrt(3)*r/(4*pi), 0]^T.
# The term (3*r/(2*pi))*sin(2*pi/3) simplifies to 3*sqrt(3)*r/(4*pi), which is the first component of b, b_1.
# So, E_1 = (x_1^1 - b_1)^2 + (x_1^2)^2. Since b_2=0, this is ||x_1 - b||^2.
# From the recurrence, x_1 = M*x_0 + b, which means x_1 - b = M*x_0.
# Therefore, E_1 = ||M*x_0||^2. Since M is a rotation matrix, ||M*x_0||^2 = ||x_0||^2.
# So, the value we need to find is (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.

# Step 4: Apply Boundary Conditions.
# From x_{2025}^2 = 10^20 and periodicity (2025 is a multiple of 3), we get x_0^2 = 10^20.
x0_2 = 10**20

# Step 5: Resolve ambiguity.
# The second boundary condition, as written, leads to a final answer that depends on 'r'.
# This contradicts the problem's request for a single value. The most plausible interpretation
# is a typo in that condition. If the term sqrt(3)/(2*pi) was meant to be sqrt(3)*r/(2*pi),
# the problem becomes self-consistent and yields the relation: x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2.
# We proceed with this assumption.
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 6: Calculate the final value.
# The value is (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
result = x0_1**2 + x0_2**2

# Output the final equation and result.
print("The expression to be evaluated simplifies to (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.")
print("Using the boundary conditions (with the likely intended correction), we find the values for the components of x_0.")
print("The final calculation is:")
print(f"({x0_1:.3e})^2 + ({x0_2:.3e})^2 = {result:.3e}")
