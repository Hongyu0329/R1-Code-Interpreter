print("\n1. Analyzing the statements for their objective truth:")

# Statement S5 analysis
friend_age = 18
my_age = 19
print(f"S5: 'My best friend is older than me. He is {friend_age} and I am {my_age}.'")
s5_is_false_reason = f"the statement claims the friend is older, but the ages given ({friend_age} for the friend, {my_age} for Fred) show the friend is younger. This is a direct contradiction."
print(f"Conclusion: S5 is always FALSE because {s5_is_false_reason}")

# Statement S1 analysis
print("S1: 'My name is Fred; and if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday.'")
s1_is_true_reason = "the premise 'yesterday was after tomorrow' is a logical impossibility (always false). A conditional statement ('if P, then Q') with a false premise is always logically true, regardless of the conclusion."
print(f"Conclusion: S1 is always TRUE because {s1_is_true_reason}")


print("\n2. Applying the puzzle's rules:")
print("Rule 1: 'Only one statement is true.'")
print("Rule 2: 'Fred said it [the true statement] on the day when he tells the truth.'")
print("Rule 3: The question 'Which day does Fred say the truth?' implies there is a single, unique truth-telling day.")

# Deducing the true statement
print("\nDeduction from Rule 1:")
print("Since S1 is always TRUE, it must be the one and only true statement allowed by Rule 1.")
print("This forces statements S3 ('friends total is even') and S4 ('males equal females') to be FALSE.")


print("\n3. Finding the day from the true statement:")
print("The true statement, S1, must contain the clue to identify the specific day. It mentions 'Wednesday'.")
print("In this type of logic puzzle, a structure like 'if [IMPOSSIBLE CONDITION], then [RESULT]' is often a code.")
print("The impossible condition highlights the 'RESULT' as the key information being conveyed.")
print("Combined with Rule 3 (there's only one truth day), the hidden meaning of S1 is: 'My single Truth Day is Wednesday.'")


print("\n4. Final Verification:")
print("Let's test the hypothesis: Fred's single Truth Day is Wednesday.")
print("According to Rule 2, on his Truth Day (Wednesday), Fred says the true statement (S1).")
print("The hidden meaning of S1 is 'My Truth Day is Wednesday'.")
print("When Fred says this on a Wednesday, he is telling the truth. This is consistent and solves the puzzle.")
