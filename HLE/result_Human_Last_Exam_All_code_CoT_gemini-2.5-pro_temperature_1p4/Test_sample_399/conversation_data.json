    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. This is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can see that it's possible to separate the variables $x$ and $t$.\n2.  **Separate and Integrate**: I will rewrite the equation as $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$ and integrate both sides to find the general solution.\n    *   $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n    *   $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n    *   This gives the implicit solution: $-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$, where C is the integration constant.\n3.  **Apply the Initial Condition**: I will use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of the constant C.\n    *   $-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n    *   $\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n4.  **Find the Particular Solution**: With $C = 1/8$, the particular solution is $-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$. To make it easier to work with, I will solve for $x(t)$ explicitly:\n    *   $-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8}$\n    *   $x(t) = -\\frac{8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1}$\n5.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$. The Python code below will perform this final calculation and print out the steps.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# The problem is to find x(1) for the IVP x'(t)=(t-1)x^2(t) with x(0)=-8.\n# The analytical solution for x(t) is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1).\n\n# Define the coefficients of the polynomial in the denominator.\n# x(t) = num / (a*t^2 + b*t + c)\nnum = -8\na = 4\nb = -8\nc = 1\n\n# The value of t at which to evaluate the solution.\nt = 1\n\nprint(f\"The particular solution to the initial value problem is x(t) = {num} / ({a}t^2 + {b}t + {c}).\")\nprint(f\"We want to find the value of x({t}).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Substitute t = {t} into the equation for x(t):\")\n\n# Print the equation with the substituted values.
