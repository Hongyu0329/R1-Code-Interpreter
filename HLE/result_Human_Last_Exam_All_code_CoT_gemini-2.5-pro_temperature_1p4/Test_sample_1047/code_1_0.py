    # Analysis of A
    print("Choice A states the matters are not related.")
    print("Analysis: This is incorrect. Although the practice area changed from litigation to commercial, the matters are 'substantially related' because the confidential information (financials, contracts) NC LLP obtained from ATI is highly relevant to the acquisition. The firm has knowledge that would prejudice its former client.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Analysis of B
    print("Choice B relies on internal measures ('ethical walls').")
    print("Analysis: This is incorrect. While ethical walls are a tool to manage conflicts, they cannot cure a direct conflict where a firm acts against a former client on a related matter without that client's consent. The duty owed to the former client is paramount.")
    print("-" * 30)
    
    # Analysis of C
    print("Choice C focuses on the partners' access to information.")
    print("Analysis: This is plausible but not the core legal reason. The conflict is imputed to the entire firm, not just because of the partners' status. The firm itself possesses the disqualifying information. The fundamental issue is the duty owed by the firm, not just the access rights of partners.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Analysis of D
    print("Choice D focuses on the lack of consent from the prejudiced party.")
    print("Analysis: This is correct. A clear conflict of interest exists. NC LLP is acting for a new client (Six Wings) in a matter directly adverse to a former client (ATI), where confidential information obtained from ATI is relevant. For the firm to proceed in such a case, it must obtain informed consent from the former client. The problem states that ATI will not consent, therefore NC LLP is disqualified from acting.")
    print("-" * 30)
    
    # Analysis of E
    print("Choice E claims an absolute prohibition on representing opposing parties.")
    print("Analysis: This is incorrect because it's too absolute. Many conflicts of interest can be waived if the affected parties give informed consent. It misstates the general rule by suggesting consent is never an option.")
