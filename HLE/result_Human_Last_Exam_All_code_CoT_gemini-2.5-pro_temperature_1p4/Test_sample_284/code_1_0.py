    Solves the problem of finding the largest p for the Fourier uniqueness property on the moment curve.
    
    The problem asks for the largest value of p such that if a function f is in L^p(R^3)
    and its Fourier transform is supported on the moment curve S = {(t, t^2, t^3)},
    then f must be the zero function.
    
    This is a classic problem in harmonic analysis. The answer is given by a critical exponent
    from the theory of Fourier restriction/extension for curves.
    
    For a non-degenerate curve in R^n (of which the moment curve is a prime example),
    the ability to construct a non-zero L^p function with Fourier support on the curve
    is possible if and only if p is greater than a critical value. This value is n*(n+1).
    
    For p <= n*(n+1), any such function must be zero. The largest value of p for which this
    uniqueness property holds is therefore p = n*(n+1).
    
    In this problem, we are in R^3, so n=3.
