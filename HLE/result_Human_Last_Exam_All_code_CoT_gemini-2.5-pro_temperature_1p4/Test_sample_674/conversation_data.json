    "I have analyzed the sequence S4 and the pattern of the rules for S1, S2, and S3. The previous sequences use simple recurrence relations. S4 seems to follow a more complex recurrence relation where the indices of the previous terms depend on the values of other previous terms.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the initial terms of the sequence, `s[1] = 1` and `s[2] = 1`, as they cannot be generated by a rule that depends on two previous terms.\n2.  Hypothesize a recurrence relation for `s[n]` for `n > 2`. Based on analysis and trial of different forms, a plausible candidate for the rule `R(s[n])` is a combination of indexing based on values of prior terms. The rule I have deduced is `R(s[n]) = s[n - s[n-1]] + s[s[n-2]]`.\n3.  Write a Python script to generate the sequence using this rule up to the 42nd term, which is the length of the sequence provided.\n4.  The script will print the generated sequence to allow for comparison with the target sequence.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the deduced rule, fulfilling the user's request to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef generate_s4(n_max):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the sequence S4 based on the deduced rule.\n    R(s[n]) = s[n - s[n-1]] + s[s[n-2]]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using a dictionary for 1-based indexing\n    s = {1: 1, 2: 1}\n    for n in range(3, n_max + 1):\n        try:\n            # Check if indices are valid before accessing\n            idx1 = n - s[n-1]\n            idx2 = s[n-2]\n            if idx1 in s and idx2 in s:\n                s[n] = s[idx1] + s[idx2]\n            else:\n                # Handle cases where indices might be out of bounds (e.g., <= 0)\n                # or not yet computed.
