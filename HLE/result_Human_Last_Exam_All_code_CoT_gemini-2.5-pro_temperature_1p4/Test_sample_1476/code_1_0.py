    print("A fundamental result (the Flow Decomposition Theorem) states that any non-negative, divergence-free flow (circulation) on a graph can be expressed as a sum of simple cycle flows.")

    print("   The total variation of the vertex signal x^0 is defined as TV(x^0) = Sum_{e={u,v}} |x^0_u - x^0_v|.")
