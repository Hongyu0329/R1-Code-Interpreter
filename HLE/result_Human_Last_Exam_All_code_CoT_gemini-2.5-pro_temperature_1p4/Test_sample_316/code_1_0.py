# The problem asks for a critical exponent in an inequality related to the cone in R^3.
# We are given that one such exponent is 4.

# In the theory of restriction and decoupling for the cone, the exponents are determined
# by the geometry of how wave packets can overlap. Different ranges of the parameter 'p'
# are dominated by different geometric configurations, and the points where the
# dominant configuration changes are the critical exponents.

# The exponent p=4 is the Tomas-Stein exponent. The other prominent critical exponent
# in this theory arises from bilinear restriction estimates. For the cone in R^3,
# this critical value is known to be p = 10/3.

# We define the other critical exponent via its fractional representation.
numerator = 10
denominator = 3

other_critical_exponent = numerator / denominator

# The final equation is simply the computation of the fraction.
# As requested, we print all numbers involved in this "equation".
