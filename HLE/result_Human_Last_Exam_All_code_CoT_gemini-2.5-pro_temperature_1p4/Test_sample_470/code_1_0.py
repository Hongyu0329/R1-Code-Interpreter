# The task is to compute the value of k(B) - l(B) for a block B.
# B is a block of a group algebra FG, where F has characteristic 2.
# The defect group of B is D = (C_2)^5.
# The inertial quotient of B has order 5.

# Let's define the terms:
# k(B): The number of irreducible ordinary characters (over C) in the block B.
# l(B): The number of irreducible Brauer characters (over F) in the block B.
# k_0(B): The number of irreducible ordinary characters in B of height zero.

# Step 1: Relate l(B) to characters of height zero.
print("Step 1: Use Brauer's theorem on the number of Brauer characters.")
print("A fundamental theorem by Richard Brauer states that for any p-block B,")
print("the number of irreducible Brauer characters l(B) is equal to the number of")
print("irreducible ordinary characters of height zero, k_0(B).")
print("This gives us the equation: l(B) = k_0(B).")

print("Substituting this into the expression we want to compute:")
print("k(B) - l(B) = k(B) - k_0(B)")
print("This difference is exactly the number of irreducible characters in B that have a positive height.")
print("-" * 60)

# Step 2: Use the properties of the defect group D.
print("Step 2: Apply the Brauer's Height Zero Theorem.")
print("The problem states that the defect group is D = (C_2)^5.")
print("This group is an elementary abelian 2-group, and therefore it is abelian.")
print("")
print("Brauer's Height Zero Conjecture, which is now a proven theorem (by Navarro and Sp√§th), states that")
print("all irreducible characters in a block B have height zero if and only if the defect group D of the block is abelian.")
print("-" * 60)

# Step 3: Conclude and compute the result.
print("Step 3: Combine the theorems to find the final value.")
print("Since the defect group D is abelian, the theorem implies that all k(B) characters in block B must have height zero.")
print("This means the number of characters with positive height is 0.")
print("Therefore, we have the equality k(B) = k_0(B).")
print("")
print("Now we can compute the final result:")
print("k(B) - l(B) = k_0(B) - k_0(B)")
result = 0

print("The final equation is k(B) - l(B) = 0.")
