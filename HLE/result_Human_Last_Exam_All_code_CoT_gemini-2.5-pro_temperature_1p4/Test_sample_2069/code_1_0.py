    This function formulates and prints the two additional inequalities required
    to model the piecewise function f(x) using MILP.
    
    The function f(x) is defined as:
    f(x) = x - 1, if x >= 1
    f(x) = min(0, x), if x < 1

    The additional inequalities involve a new binary variable 'b', which is
    assumed to be 1 if x >= 0 and 0 if x < 0. The parameters 'l' and 'u'
    are the lower and upper bounds on x, respectively.
