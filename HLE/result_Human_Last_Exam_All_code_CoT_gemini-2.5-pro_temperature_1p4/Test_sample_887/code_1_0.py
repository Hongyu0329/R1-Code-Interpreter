    # Chemical reactions have an energy barrier (activation energy). The added
    # vibrational energy helps the C-H bond overcome this barrier much more easily.

        "This excitation effectively lowers the energy requirement for C-H bond cleavage."

    # The direct result is a dramatic increase in the rate at which the excited C-H bond breaks.
    # This also makes the reaction highly selective, strongly favoring the removal of the
    # H atom over the unexcited D atoms.
