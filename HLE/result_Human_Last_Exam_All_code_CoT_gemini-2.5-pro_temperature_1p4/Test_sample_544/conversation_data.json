    "My plan is to solve this chemical question by first determining the reaction product and then finding its official IUPAC name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reactants are methyl phenyl sulfoxide, triflic anhydride (a very strong activating agent), and trimethylsilyl cyanide (a cyanide source). This is a classic setup for a **Pummerer rearrangement**.\n2.  **Determine the Product:**\n    *   The oxygen of the sulfoxide attacks the triflic anhydride, creating a good leaving group and an activated sulfonium ion, `[Ph-S(OTf)-CH3]^+`.\n    *   This intermediate rearranges to form an electrophilic thionium ion, `[Ph-S=CH2]^+`.\n    *   The cyanide (`CN-`) from trimethylsilyl cyanide then attacks the carbon of the thionium ion.\n    *   This results in the formation of an Î±-cyano sulfide with the structure: `Ph-S-CH2-CN`.\n3.  **Find the IUPAC Name:** The product is `C6H5-S-CH2-CN`.\n    *   The main functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`).\n    *   The parent chain containing this group is `-CH2-CN`. This is a two-carbon chain, so the systematic parent name is `ethanenitrile`. The common retained name is `acetonitrile`.\n    *   A `phenylsulfanyl` group (`C6H5-S-`) is attached at position 2 (the nitrile carbon is position 1).\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile**.\n4.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script to verify this. The script will use the `pubchempy` library to fetch the IUPAC name from the product's chemical structure, which I will represent using a SMILES string. The script will also print the reaction equation and an explanation of the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemical_naming_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the IUPAC name of a chemical product by analyzing the reaction\n    and using the pubchempy library for verification.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reaction and deduce the product based on chemical principles.\n    # The reaction is a cyano-Pummerer rearrangement.\n    # Stoichiometry: 1 eq. methyl phenyl sulfoxide + 1 eq. triflic anhydride + 1 eq.
