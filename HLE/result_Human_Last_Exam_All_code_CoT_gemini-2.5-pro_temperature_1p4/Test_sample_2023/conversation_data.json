    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the function $f(a,b,c)$**: The recurrence relation defining $f(a,b,c)$ implies that it's a counting problem. Specifically, $f(a,b,c)$ represents the number of ways to reach the point $(a,b,c)$ starting from $(0,0,0)$ using steps of type $(1,0,0)$, $(0,2,0)$, and $(0,0,3)$. This is non-zero only if $b$ is an even integer and $c$ is a multiple of 3. For such $(a,b,c)$, the value is given by the multinomial coefficient $\\binom{a+b/2+c/3}{a, b/2, c/3}$.\n2.  **Verify conditions for arguments**: I will check if $\\beta_p$ is even and $\\gamma_p$ is a multiple of 3. Based on their definitions as sums, it's straightforward to show that these conditions hold.\n3.  **Use Lucas's Theorem**: The problem requires calculating the result modulo a prime $p=2^{127}-1$. Lucas's Theorem is a powerful tool for computing binomial (and multinomial) coefficients modulo a prime. The theorem states that $\\binom{n}{k} \\equiv \\prod_i \\binom{n_i}{k_i} \\pmod p$, where $n_i$ and $k_i$ are the digits of $n$ and $k$ in base $p$. To use this, I need the base-$p$ representations of $a=\\alpha_p$, $j=\\beta_p/2$, and $k=\\gamma_p/3$.\n4.  **Determine base-$p$ digits**: The given formulas for $\\alpha_p$, $\\beta_p$, and $\\gamma_p$ are sums of powers of $p$. These forms directly give us the base-$p$ digits. I will find that the digit sequences for $a, j, k$ are periodic with a period of 3.\n5.  **Simplify the product**: Applying Lucas's Theorem results in a long product of smaller multinomial coefficients. Due to the periodic nature of the digits, this product can be simplified into the form $X^E \\pmod p$, where $X$ is the product of coefficients over one cycle and $E$ is the number of cycles.\n6.  **Evaluate the power using number theory**: The exponent $E$ will be of the form $\\frac{3p+1}{2}$. I will evaluate $X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$ by relating it to the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{X}{p})$ via Fermat's Little Theorem.\n7.  **Calculate the Legendre Symbol**: I'll compute $(\\frac{X}{p})$ using properties of the symbol and the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Combine the results to get the final numerical answer. I will write a Python script to perform the necessary calculations and print the final result as requested. Since the values of $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$ are too large to compute, their symbolic definitions will be used in the final output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program calculates the value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p.\n    The logic follows the plan outlined above.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # p is the Mersenne prime 2^127 - 1.\n    p = 2**127 - 1\n\n    # The function f(a,b,c) is non-zero only if b is even and c is a multiple of 3.\n    # The given beta_p and gamma_p satisfy these conditions.\n    # f(a,b,c) = C(a + b/2 + c/3; a, b/2, c/3), the multinomial coefficient.\n\n    # We use Lucas's Theorem.
