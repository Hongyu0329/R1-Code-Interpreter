    # Arguments against external or flawed indicators

    print("   - H (Credit rating): The ratings were notoriously inaccurate and misleading. They were a feature of the crisis's propagation, not a determinant of the assets' fundamental value.")

    # Differentiating between loan characteristics and their source
    print("   - B (% floating rate) and C (Average FICO): These are critical risk characteristics of the loan pools. However, these characteristics were the *result* of decisions made by the loan originators.")

    print("     The 'Originate-to-Distribute' business model incentivized issuers to prioritize loan volume over quality. This led to a systemic degradation of underwriting standards, the creation of inherently risky loan products, and the packaging of these toxic assets into RMBS.")
