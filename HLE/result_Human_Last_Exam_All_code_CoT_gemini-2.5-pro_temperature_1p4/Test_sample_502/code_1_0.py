# The order of the group G.
group_order = 10000

# The dimension of the vector space V on which G acts, and the number of variables in the polynomial ring R.
n_variables = 10

# Step 1: State the relevant mathematical theorem.
# A theorem from invariant theory (by Chevalley, Shephard-Todd, and Steinberg) states that for a finite group
# G' acting on a complex vector space V, the dimension of the coinvariant ring R/I is equal to the order of the group G'.
# Here, R is the polynomial ring C[V] and I is the ideal generated by positive-degree G'-invariant polynomials.
# Equation: dim(R/I) = |G'| where G' is the group effectively acting on the space.

# Step 2: Define the effective group and its order.
# The problem states that a group G of order 10000 acts on C^10. This action is defined by a representation
# rho: G -> GL_10(C). The group effectively acting on C^10 is the image of this map, G' = rho(G).
# The order of this effective group is given by the first isomorphism theorem: |G'| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.
print(f"The dimension of the quotient ring R/I is the order of the effective group G', which is given by the formula:")
print(f"dim(R/I) = |G| / |ker(rho)|")
print(f"where |G| is the order of the group G, and |ker(rho)| is the size of the kernel of the action.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Formulate the maximization problem.
# We want to find the largest possible dimension of R/I by varying G and its action rho.
# To maximize dim(R/I), we must maximize the value of |G| / |ker(rho)|.
# The order |G| is fixed.
print(f"The order of the group G is given as |G| = {group_order}.")

# To maximize the dimension, we need to minimize the denominator, |ker(rho)|.
# The kernel is a subgroup of G, so its minimum possible size is 1.
# This corresponds to a faithful representation, where ker(rho) is the trivial subgroup.
min_kernel_size = 1
print(f"To maximize the dimension, we need to find the minimum possible size of the kernel.")
print(f"The minimum possible kernel size is {min_kernel_size}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Verify that the maximum is achievable.
# The maximum dimension is |G|/1 = |G| if there exists a group G of order 10000 with a faithful
# representation into GL_10(C).
# The cyclic group G = C_10000 is an example. A generator can be mapped to a diagonal matrix
# diag(exp(2*pi*i/10000), 1, ..., 1), which defines a faithful representation.
# Therefore, the maximal value is indeed achievable.

# Step 5: Perform the final calculation.
max_dimension = group_order / min_kernel_size

print(f"The largest possible dimension is calculated by the equation:")
print(f"Max Dimension = (Order of G) / (Minimum Kernel Size)")
print(f"Max Dimension = {group_order} / {min_kernel_size} = {int(max_dimension)}")
