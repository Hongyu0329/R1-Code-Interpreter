        "In the solid state required for an OLED, the radical emitter molecules are in close "

        "pathway for the excited state to return to the ground state, releasing energy as "
        "heat instead of light. This quenching process directly reduces the number of "
        "emitted photons, thus lowering the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE)."
