    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task.\n\nFirst, I will identify the noble gases: Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.\n\nThen, I will find their respective abundances on Earth. The most common measurement is their concentration in the atmosphere. While the question asks for a percentage of *all terrestrial matter*, the relative rarity of the gases is consistent across different measures (atmosphere, crust, etc.), and atmospheric concentration is a reliable proxy for determining the rarest.\n\nRadon is a radioactive gas with a very short half-life (its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days). This means it decays almost as soon as it is formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Consequently, it never accumulates in significant quantities, making it by far the rarest noble gas. The specific year, 2002, does not change this fundamental fact of nuclear physics.\n\nMy Python script will encode these known atmospheric abundances into a dictionary and then programmatically find and print the gas with the lowest percentage.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its atmospheric abundance.\n    The data for 2002 is effectively the same as current data for these gases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary stores the noble gases and their approximate abundance\n    # in Earth's atmosphere as a percentage by volume.\n    noble_gas_abundances = {\n        \"Argon (Ar)\": 0.934,\n        \"Neon (Ne)\": 0.001818,\n        \"Helium (He)\": 0.000524,\n        \"Krypton (Kr)\": 0.000114,\n        \"Xenon (Xe)\": 8.7e-6,  # 0.0000087%\n        \"Radon (Rn)\": 1e-19    # Radon's abundance is extremely low, about 1 part per 10^21, which is 1e-19 percent.\n    }\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum abundance from the dictionary\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundances, key=noble_gas_abundances.get)\n    rarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_abundances[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Print the final result including the name and percentage value.\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"Its approximate abundance as a percentage of the atmosphere is:\")\n    # Formatting the output to show the number in the final statement\n    print(f\"Abundance of {rarest_gas_name} = {rarest_gas_percentage:.1e}%\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon (Rn)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
