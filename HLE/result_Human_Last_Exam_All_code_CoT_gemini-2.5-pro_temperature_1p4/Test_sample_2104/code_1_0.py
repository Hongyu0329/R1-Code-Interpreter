    # Step 1: Determine n1 and n2.
    # The problem specifies that n1 and n2 are the two smallest positive integers `n` that satisfy:
    # 1. u_r(n) = n/2 - 1
    # 2. u_r(n+1) = n
    # 3. u_r(n-1) = n-2
    # The first condition implies n must be even. These conditions self-consistently define the function 
    # u_r(n) and are satisfied by all positive even integers n.
    # Therefore, the 1st and 2nd smallest such integers are n1 and n2.
    n1 = 2
    n2 = 4

    # Step 2: Analyze the Hamiltonian and calculate its period.
    # The value to find is T(alpha), where alpha = (n1-1)/n2.
    # T(alpha) is the period of the system with Hamiltonian:
    # H(p, q) = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - C * q^(n1/2))
    # where C = (2/n1) * sqrt((n2-n1)/(n1/2))
    #
    # With n1=2, the exponent of q is n1/2 = 1. This makes the potential quadratic.
    # The Hamiltonian becomes H = 1/2 * p^2 + 1/2 * (q^2 - C*q), which describes a simple
    # harmonic oscillator. By completing the square, it can be seen that the mass m=1 and
    # the spring constant k=1.
    # The period of a harmonic oscillator is T = 2 * pi * sqrt(m/k).
    # For m=1, k=1, the period is simply 2 * pi.
    
    # Step 3: Formulate the final equation and compute the result.
    # The final equation is T((n1 - 1) / n2) = 2 * pi.
    # Here we print out all the numerical components of this final equation.
