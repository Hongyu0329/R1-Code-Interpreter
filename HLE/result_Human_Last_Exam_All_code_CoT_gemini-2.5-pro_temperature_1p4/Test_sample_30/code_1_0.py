# The user wants me to identify the correct statement about interactive proof systems.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis:
# A is incorrect because interaction is key.
# B is incorrect because GNI is a classic, helpful example.
# C is incorrect because quantum entanglement (in MIP*) is extremely powerful.
# D is correct. It accurately describes the computational asymmetry between the polynomial-time verifier and the powerful prover, a core concept.
# E is incorrect because of amplification; the exact values don't matter much.
# F is incorrect because two provers (MIP) are more powerful than one (IP).
# G is incorrect because IP = PSPACE, which is considered much larger than NP.
# H is incorrect because the standard alphabet is binary {0, 1}, not trinary.
# I is incorrect because it states the soundness condition for NP backwards.
# J is too specific and technical to be the best general answer.
#
# Therefore, the correct statement is D.

final_answer = 'D'
print(f"The correct statement is D. It correctly describes the standard model for an interactive proof system, where the verifier is computationally limited (runs in polynomial time) to be considered 'efficient', while the prover is assumed to be computationally powerful (often modeled as having exponential or unbounded resources) to be able to answer the verifier's queries.")
