    "Based on StarCraft lore, the Second Great War begins in the year 2504 with the events of *Wings of Liberty* and concludes in the year 2506 with the end of the *Legacy of the Void* campaign.\n\nTo calculate the duration, I will subtract the start year from the end year. The result will then be rounded up as requested, although in this case, the result is a whole number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_war_duration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n    The war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_year = 2504\n    end_year = 2506\n\n    # Calculate the raw duration\n    raw_duration = end_year - start_year\n    \n    # Round up the result as per the request\n    final_duration = math.ceil(raw_duration)\n\n    print(f\"The Second Great War started in the year {start_year} and ended in the year {end_year}.\")\n    print(\"To find the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {raw_duration}\")\n    print(f\"The total duration is {final_duration} years.\")\n\ncalculate_war_duration()\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
