    print("In Ontario, the 'Working for Workers Act, 2021' amended the Employment Standards Act to ban non-competition agreements.")
    print("This ban applies to any non-compete clauses entered into on or after October 25, 2021.")
    print("The law is NOT retroactive, so agreements made before this date are not automatically voided by this new rule.")

    # Step 3: Explain the 'executive' exception.
    print("Key Exception:")
    print("The ban does not apply to employees who are 'executives'.")
    print("The law narrowly defines 'executive' as C-suite level roles (e.g., CEO, President, CFO, Chief Legal Officer).")

    # Option A
    print("A. Restaurant Manager (Started 2022):")

    # Option C
    print("C. Branch Manager (Started 2023):")

    # Option E
    print("E. Cashier (Started 2019):")

    print(f"Final Conclusion:")
    print(f"Only the employee in option {final_answer} could potentially have a valid and enforceable non-competition clause because their employment began before the statutory ban was enacted.")
