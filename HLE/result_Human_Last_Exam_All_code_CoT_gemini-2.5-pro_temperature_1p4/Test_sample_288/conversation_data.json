    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons, I will use a Python script to query the C. elegans connectome. The C. elegans nervous system contains a pair of ASJ neurons, ASJL (left) and ASJR (right), so I will consider the outgoing connections from both.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will use the `owconnectome` Python library, which contains the connectome data for the adult hermaphrodite. You may need to install it first by running `pip install owconnectome`.\n2.  The script will load the connectome data.\n3.  It will then iterate through all the chemical synapses originating from both ASJL and ASJR.\n4.  For each target neuron, the script will sum the number of synapses it receives from both ASJL and ASJR.\n5.  Finally, it will determine which target neuron receives the highest total number of synapses and print this result.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ntry:\n    from owconnectome import connectome\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the 'owconnectome' library first by running: pip install owconnectome\")\n    exit()\n\ndef find_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main projection target for a given source neuron pair in the C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load the connectome data\n    c = connectome.Connectome()\n\n    # The ASJ neuron pair\n    source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n    \n    # A dictionary to store synapse counts for each target neuron\n    target_synapse_counts = collections.defaultdict(int)\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing outgoing chemical synapses from {', '.join(source_neurons)}...\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through the source neurons to get their connections\n    for source_neuron in source_neurons:\n        # Get all outgoing chemical synapses for the current neuron\n        connections = c.connections(pre_cell=source_neuron, kind='chemical')\n        for pre_cell, post_cell, num_synapses, conn_type in connections:\n            # Add the synapse count to the target neuron's total\n            target_synapse_counts[post_cell] += num_synapses\n            \n    if not target_synapse_counts:\n        print(\"No outgoing connections found for ASJ neurons.\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the neuron with the maximum number of synapses\n    main_target_neuron = max(target_synapse_counts, key=target_synapse_counts.get)\n    max_synapses = target_synapse_counts[main_target_neuron]\n\n    # Print the full list of targets for context, sorted by synapse count\n    print(\"Total synapse counts from ASJ (ASJL + ASJR) to target neurons:\")\n    sorted_targets = sorted(target_synapse_counts.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    for target, count in sorted_targets:\n        print(f\"ASJ -> {target}: {count} synapses\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is {main_target_neuron} with a total of {max_synapses} synapses.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------\")\n    \n    return main_target_neuron\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main_target = find_main_target()\n\n```\n<<<AIY>>>"
