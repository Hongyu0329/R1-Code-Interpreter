    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we need to classify all possible stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. A key concept here is that a curve is \"stable\" if it is complete, connected, has only ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities, and possesses a finite automorphism group.\n\nThe classification can be performed by analyzing the possible structures of the curve, which are best described by their \"dual graphs\". In these graphs, each vertex represents an irreducible component of the curve, and each edge represents a node connecting two components. A self-loop on a vertex represents a node on a single component.\n\nThe classification yields 8 distinct types, which can be grouped by their number of irreducible components:\n\n1.  **Curves with one irreducible component (3 types):**\n    *   A smooth curve of genus 2 (this is the case of \"good reduction\").\n    *   An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve) with one node.\n    *   An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 (a rational curve) with two nodes.\n\n2.  **Curves with two irreducible components (3 types):**\n    *   Two elliptic curves meeting at a single point (node).\n    *   An elliptic curve and a nodal rational curve (a rational curve with one node) meeting at a single point.\n    *   Two rational curves meeting at three distinct points (nodes).\n\n3.  **Curves with three irreducible components (2 types):**\n    *   A chain of three curves where the two ends are elliptic curves and the middle is a rational curve (an \"elliptic-rational-elliptic\" chain).\n    *   A chain of three curves: one elliptic curve, one rational curve, and one nodal rational curve, connected in that order.\n\nThe following Python code enumerates these types and calculates the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reductions_genus_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of different types of stable reduction\n    for curves of genus 2.\n\n    The classification is based on the combinatorial type of the dual graph of the\n    stable curve.
