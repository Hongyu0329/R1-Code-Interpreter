# Step 1: Calculate the value of the summation part (S).
# l(n,p) is the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold M(n,p), which is pi.
# The sum is over i=1 to 10 and j=1 to 10, for a total of 10*10 = 100 terms.
num_terms = 10 * 10
s_val = num_terms * np.pi

# Step 2: Calculate the value of the integral part (I).
# The integral can be split into two parts.
# The first part is assumed to be 0 based on the problem's structure,
# which suggests a simplification where d1 = d2, making the numerator zero.
integral_part_1 = 0

# The second part is the integral of x * exp(-x) from 0 to infinity, which is 1.
integral_part_2 = 1

# The total value of the integral I is the sum of its parts.
i_val = integral_part_1 + integral_part_2

# Step 3: Calculate the final result by multiplying S and I.
final_result = s_val * i_val

# As requested, output each number in the final equation.
