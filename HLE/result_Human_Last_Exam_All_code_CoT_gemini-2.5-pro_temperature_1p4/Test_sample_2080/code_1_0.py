# Step 1: Define the known parameters.
# The partial specific volume for a typical monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a standard biophysical constant.
# Unit: mL/g
partial_specific_volume = 0.73

# The steric-only contribution to the second osmotic virial coefficient (B_steric)
# is calculated using a hard-sphere model. The formula is B_steric = 8 * v_bar,
# where v_bar is the partial specific volume. This factor of 8 is a common
# approximation in protein science.
factor = 8.0

# Step 2: Calculate the second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior.
b2_steric = factor * partial_specific_volume

# Step 3: Print the results, showing the equation and the final calculated value.
# The experimental value of -7.585 mL/g is contextual information about the net
# interactions but is not needed to calculate the steric-only component.
