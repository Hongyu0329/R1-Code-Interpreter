    "My plan is to determine the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the given First-Order Logic fragment.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Logic and Hypothesis Class**: First, I will analyze the structure of the formulas in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. The schema $S$ contains four unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The allowed logical connectives are existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). A hypothesis is a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable, $x$, which classifies elements of the domain. I will show that any such formula is equivalent to one of the following forms:\n    *   $\\bot$ (the empty set).\n    *   A pure conjunction of atomic predicates: $P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_k}(x)$, where $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The empty conjunction (for $k=0$) is equivalent to $\\top$.\n    This means the concept class consists of the empty set and all possible intersections of the base predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. This is the class of \"monotone conjunctions\".\n\n2.  **Establish the Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)**: I will show that a set of 4 points can be shattered. To do this, I need to define a specific universe and interpretation of the predicates $P_1, \\dots, P_4$ on a set of 4 points, $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$, such that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a concept in our class that selects exactly $Y$. I will demonstrate this constructively.\n\n3.  **Establish the Upper Bound (VC-dim $< 5$)**: I will show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. The number of concepts expressible is at most $2^4$ (for all subsets of predicates to form conjunctions) + 1 (for the $\\bot$ concept), which is $17$. To shatter a set of 5 points, we would need to generate all $2^5 = 32$ possible labelings. Since $17 < 32$, it's impossible to shatter any set of 5 points, regardless of the predicate definitions.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Code**: From the lower and upper bounds, the VC dimension must be exactly 4. I will write a Python script that implements the construction from step 2. The script will define 4 points and 4 predicates and then programmatically demonstrate that all $2^4=16$ subsets of the points can be generated, thus proving that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates that the VC dimension of monotone conjunctions\n    of 4 predicates is at least 4 by shattering a set of 4 points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
