    This function analyzes a literary translation problem and prints the solution.
    
    The problem:
    Two mystery stories, Asimov's "The Next Day" and Christie's "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter,"
    share a plot element that is difficult to translate. This element is a clue based on
    a pun or phonetic ambiguity in the English language ("Pay me" vs. "Amy"; misheard slurred words).
    A direct translation would lose this crucial clue.
    
    The task is to identify which of the six proposed translation practices could
    effectively solve this problem.
