    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the provided 3x3 matrix. The mention of the \"Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13\" is extra context that is not needed for the calculation, as the matrix itself is given.\n\nTo fulfill the user's request to \"output each number in the final equation\", I will not use a standard library function like `numpy.linalg.det` which would hide the calculation steps. Instead, I will write Python code that implements the Sarrus' rule for calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. This will allow me to print out the complete formula with all the numbers, showing the intermediate products and their summation, which leads to the final result.\n\nThe steps in the code will be:\n1.  Define the matrix `A`.\n2.  Extract each element of the matrix into a separate variable.\n3.  Calculate the six product terms required by Sarrus' rule.\n4.  Sum these terms according to the rule to get the determinant.\n5.  Print the full calculation, showing the formula with the actual numbers, the result of each product, and the final determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem asks to compute the determinant of the given adjacency matrix A.\n# The matrix A is provided as:\n# A = [[ 2, -1, -1],\n#      [-1,  2, -1],\n#      [-1, -1,  2]]\n#\n# The value m_{1/2} = 13 is context about the Markov quiver but not needed\n# for the determinant calculation of the given matrix.\n#\n# We will calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix using Sarrus' rule:\n# det(A) = a*e*i + b*f*g + c*d*h - c*e*g - b*d*i - a*f*h\n\n# Define the matrix\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extract elements for clarity in the formula\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the six terms for Sarrus' rule\n# Positive diagonal terms\nterm1 = a * e * i\nterm2 = b * f * g\nterm3 = c * d * h\n# Negative diagonal terms\nterm4 = c * e * g\nterm5 = b * d * i\nterm6 = a * f * h\n\n# Calculate the final determinant\ndeterminant = term1 + term2 + term3 - term4 - term5 - term6\n\n# Print the final equation with each number\nprint(\"The determinant is calculated using Sarrus' rule.\")\nprint(\"The formula is: det(A) = a*e*i + b*f*g + c*d*h - c*e*g - b*d*i - a*f*h\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values from the matrix A:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a})*({e})*({i}) + ({b})*({f})*({g}) + ({c})*({d})*({h}) - ({c})*({e})*({g}) - ({b})*({d})*({i}) - ({a})*({f})*({h})\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating each term:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({term1}) + ({term2}) + ({term3}) - ({term4}) - ({term5}) - ({term6})\")\nprint(\"\\nSumming the terms:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {determinant}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
