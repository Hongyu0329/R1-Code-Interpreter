    """
    This function calculates the susceptibility chi* that satisfies the equation
    Nm(a/b, chi) + Nm(b/a, chi*) = 1 based on the duality principle in
    2D magnetostatics.

    The problem describes an infinitely long rectangular prism, which reduces the
    problem to two dimensions. In 2D, there is a duality theorem which leads
    to a sum rule for the magnetometric demagnetizing factors:
    Nm(a/b, mu) + Nm(b/a, mu_dual) = 1
    where mu_dual = mu_0^2 / mu.

    By comparing this theorem with the given equation, we can deduce that chi*
    must be the susceptibility corresponding to the dual permeability mu_dual.

    The relationship between permeability (mu) and susceptibility (chi) is:
    mu = mu_0 * (1 + chi)

    From this, we derive the expression for chi*.
