    Solves the Go puzzle by identifying all killing moves for White.

    The black group is located at A2, B3, B4, C1, C2.
    It has five liberties: A1, A3, A4, B1, and the vital point B2.

    Analysis shows that white can initiate a killing sequence by playing
    on any of these five liberties.

    1.  W @ B2: This is the vital point. It either splits the group or
        leads to a snapback, both resulting in a kill.
    2.  W @ {A1, A3, A4, B1}: Playing any of these outside liberties forces
        Black's response to be B2 to prevent an immediate split. After B@B2,
        the group is connected but still lacks enough liberties to live,
        and White can continue the attack to capture it.

    Therefore, all five moves are valid first moves for a kill.
