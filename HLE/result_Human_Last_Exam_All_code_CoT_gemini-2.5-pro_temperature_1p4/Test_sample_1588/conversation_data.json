    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent commutators of total degree 10 that can be formed from two non-commuting variables, X and Y. This quantity is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the n-th degree component of a free Lie algebra on k generators.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** We will use Witt's formula, which calculates the number of basic commutators of a given degree. For `k` generators (in our case, `k=2` for X and Y) and degree `n` (in our case, `n=10`), the formula is:\n    `L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Define the Parameters:**\n    *   `n = 10` (the order of the coefficients)\n    *   `k = 2` (the number of generators, X and Y)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Components:**\n    *   Find all divisors `d` of `n=10`.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n    *   Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` in the sum.\n\n4.  **Sum and Final Calculation:** Sum all the calculated terms and multiply by `1/n`.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be created to perform these calculations and print the entire process, showing how the final number is derived from the formula, including each numerical value in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of a number as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        # If any prime factor is squared, mu(n) = 0\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    \n    # Otherwise, mu(n) = (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1) ** len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the\n    Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion using Witt's formula and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_k(n) = (1/n) * Sum_{{d|n}} mu(d) * k^(n/d)\\n\")\n    print(f\"For our case, n={n} and k={k}:\")\n    \n    divs = get_divisors(n)\n    mu_values = [mobius(d) for d in divs]\n    \n    # 1.
