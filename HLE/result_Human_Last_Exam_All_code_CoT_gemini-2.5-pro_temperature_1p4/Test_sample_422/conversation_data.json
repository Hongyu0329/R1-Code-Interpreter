    "The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge faces several classical philosophical challenges, even when setting aside Gettier-style counterexamples. Given the constraint that our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, two significant problems emerge:\n\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The \"Justified\" condition is inherently unstable. For any belief (P) to be justified, it must be supported by a reason or another belief (Q). However, for the justification to be valid, the belief Q must *also* be justified, which requires another justifying belief (R), and so on. This leads to a logical impasse known as Agrippa's Trilemma, presenting three exhaustive but problematic outcomes:\n    *   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justification goes on forever, which is impossible for a finite mind to complete.\n    *   **Circularity:** The chain of justification eventually loops back on itself (e.g., P is justified by Q, which is justified by R, which is justified by P), which is a logical fallacy.\n    *   **Arbitrary Foundation:** The chain stops at a foundational belief that is not itself justified. This violates the rule that knowledge requires justification.\n    This problem suggests that the very concept of \"justification\" as a requirement for knowledge is fundamentally flawed, as it seems impossible to achieve without arbitrariness or logical fallacy.\n\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** The \"True\" condition stipulates that the belief must align with objective reality. The problem is that a believer has no independent, god-like perspective from which to confirm this alignment. To verify that a belief \"P is true,\" the believer can only acquire more evidence and form a new, stronger belief that \"it is true that P is true.\" They can never escape their own subjective perspective to directly access the objective truth. This makes it impossible for an agent to reliably distinguish internally between a **Justified *True* Belief (Knowledge)** and a very convincing **Justified *False* Belief**. The distinction becomes something only a hypothetical external observer could make, rendering the \"Truth\" condition practically inert for the person who holds the belief.\n\n<<<The two problems are the Regress Problem of Justification and the Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition from the believer's perspective.>>>"
