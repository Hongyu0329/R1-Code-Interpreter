# In "The Perspective of the World", Fernand Braudel introduces the volume's theme by quoting Paul Morand.
# The quote is: "'Every nation,' Paul Morand has written, 'is a world in itself, which should be visualised inside a sphere...'"
# Braudel then uses this image to frame his concept of the world-economy.
# The specific conceptual entity from the original quote is "nation".
