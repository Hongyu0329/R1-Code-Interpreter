    "My plan is to identify the source of the quote to determine the entity being discussed. The question refers to Fernand Braudel quoting Paul Morand. This points towards Braudel's major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*, specifically the third volume, *The Perspective of the World*.\n\nBy locating the passage where Braudel introduces this idea, I can find the specific word Morand used, which Braudel then adopts and expands upon. The code will then print this identified entity.\n\n```python\n# In \"The Perspective of the World\", Fernand Braudel introduces the volume's theme by quoting Paul Morand.\n# The quote is: \"'Every nation,' Paul Morand has written, 'is a world in itself, which should be visualised inside a sphere...'\"\n# Braudel then uses this image to frame his concept of the world-economy.\n# The specific conceptual entity from the original quote is \"nation\".\n\nconceptual_entity = \"nation\"\nprint(f\"The conceptual entity is: {conceptual_entity}\")\n```\n<<<nation>>>"
