    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), we need to analyze the material's crystal structure and its relationship to nonlinear optical phenomena. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process**: Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. Such processes are described by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two).\n\n2.  **State the Symmetry Requirement**: A fundamental principle of nonlinear optics is that second-order effects like SPDC can only occur in materials that lack a center of inversion. In materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric materials), the $\\chi^{(2)}$ tensor is identically zero, thus forbidding these effects.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Material's Structure**: We must determine if free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene) are centrosymmetric. Borophene has multiple possible atomic structures (polymorphs). The most commonly studied and stable phases, such as the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3}$ sheets, are known to have a centrosymmetric crystal lattice.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Conclusion**: Since the common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their $\\chi^{(2)}$ value is zero. Consequently, they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\nThe Python code below formalizes this reasoning. It defines a function that checks if a material is centrosymmetric and, based on that property, determines if SPDC is possible by evaluating the value of $\\chi^{(2)}$ in a simplified model equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef check_spdc_capability(material_name, is_centrosymmetric):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a material is expected to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric\n    Down-Conversion (SPDC) based on its crystal symmetry.\n\n    The governing principle is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear\n    optical effect. Its strength is dependent on the second-order\n    susceptibility, chi^(2). In materials with a center of inversion\n    (centrosymmetric materials), chi^(2) is required by symmetry to be zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use UTF-8 encoding to ensure special characters print correctly\n    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')\n\n    # Define unicode characters for the formula to be printed\n    chi = '\\u03C7'\n    sup_l_paren = '\\u207D'\n    sup_2 = '\\u00B2'\n    sup_r_paren = '\\u207E'\n    chi_2_symbol = f\"{chi}{sup_l_paren}{sup_2}{sup_r_paren}\"\n\n    print(f\"Analysis for: {material_name}\")\n    print(f\"Material Property (Is Centrosymmetric): {is_centrosymmetric}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # In a simplified model, the effect's strength is proportional to chi^(2).\n    # Equation: Effect_Strength = C * chi^(2), where C is a constant.\n    # The key number in this equation is the value of chi^(2).\n    if is_centrosymmetric:\n        chi_2_value = 0\n    else:\n        # For a non-centrosymmetric material, chi^(2) would be non-zero.\n        # We use a non-zero placeholder for demonstration purposes.\n        chi_2_value = 1.0  # Using an arbitrary value in placeholder units\n\n    print(f\"The simplified governing equation is: SPDC_Effect \\u221D {chi_2_symbol}\")\n    print(f\"For this material, the key number in the equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Value of {chi_2_symbol} = {chi_2_value}\")\n\n    if chi_2_value == 0:\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: Because {chi_2_symbol} is 0, the material is not expected to exhibit SPDC.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: Because {chi_2_symbol} is not 0, the material could exhibit SPDC.\")\n\n\n# Most stable, free-standing phases of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\nmaterial_to_check = {\n    \"name\": \"Free-standing Boron Nanosheet (common phases)\",\n    \"is_centrosymmetric\": True\n}\n\n# Run the analysis for the boron nanosheet.\ncheck_spdc_capability(material_to_check[\"name\"], material_to_check[\"is_centrosymmetric\"])\n```\n<<<No. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry (they are centrosymmetric). This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like spontaneous parametric down-conversion, for which the second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) must be non-zero.>>>"
