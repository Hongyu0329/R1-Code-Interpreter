No. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry (they are centrosymmetric). This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like spontaneous parametric down-conversion, for which the second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) must be non-zero.
