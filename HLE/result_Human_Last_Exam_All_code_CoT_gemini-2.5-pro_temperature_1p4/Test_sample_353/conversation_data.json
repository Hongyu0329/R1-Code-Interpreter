    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze the stability region of the method.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the BDF4 method and its stability polynomial.** The stability of a numerical method is studied by applying it to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a stability polynomial whose roots must be within the unit circle for the method to be stable. The set of all complex numbers $z = h\\lambda$ for which the method is stable forms the stability region.\n2.  **Determine the boundary of the stability region.** The boundary of the stability region is traced by the function $z(\\theta)$ which is derived from the stability polynomial by setting its root to be on the unit circle, i.e., $\\xi = e^{i\\theta}$. For BDF4, this function is:\n    $z(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$\n3.  **Find the $A(\\alpha)$-stability angle.** A method is $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$. The maximum angle $\\alpha$ is found by finding the tangent to the stability boundary $z(\\theta)$ that passes through the origin.\n4.  **Set up the tangency condition.** The tangent line to the curve $z(\\theta)$ at a point $z_0 = z(\\theta_0)$ passes through the origin if the position vector $z_0$ and the tangent vector $z'_0 = z'(\\theta_0)$ are collinear. This translates to the condition $\\text{Im}(\\overline{z_0} z'_0) = 0$.\n5.  **Solve for the angle.** This condition results in a complicated quartic equation for $c = \\cos(\\theta)$:\n    $50c^4 + 452c^3 - 64c^2 - 412c + 63 = 0$\n6.  **Calculate $\\alpha$.** We will solve this equation numerically using Python. For each valid root $c \\in [-1, 1]$, we find the corresponding $\\theta$, calculate the point on the boundary $z(\\theta) = x+iy$, and then compute the angle $\\alpha = \\pi - \\arg(z(\\theta))$. The largest such valid $\\alpha$ is the one we seek.\n7.  **Express the result in terms of `arctan()`**. The final answer will be in the form $\\alpha = \\arctan(T)$, where $T = \\tan(\\alpha) = \\tan(\\pi - \\arg(z)) = -y/x$.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan to find the numerical value of $\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cmath\n\ndef bdf4_alpha_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define and solve the quartic equation for c = cos(theta)\n    # The equation for the tangency condition is:\n    # 50*c^4 + 452*c^3 - 64*c^2 - 412*c + 63 = 0\n    coeffs = [50, 452, -64, -412, 63]\n    roots = np.roots(coeffs)\n\n    max_alpha = 0\n    tangent_val = 0\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate through real roots c in [-1, 1]\n    for c in roots:\n        if np.isreal(c) and -1 <= c.real <= 1:\n            c = c.real\n            \n            # We consider two possible angles theta for each c, one in [0, pi] and one in [pi, 2pi]\n            # Since the stability region is symmetric with respect to the real axis,\n            # we only need to consider theta in [0, pi], which means s >= 0.\n            theta = np.arccos(c)\n            s = np.sin(theta)\n\n            # Step 3: Calculate the point z(theta) on the stability boundary\n            # z(theta) = x + iy\n            # c_k = cos(k*theta), s_k = sin(k*theta)\n            c2 = np.cos(2*theta)\n            s2 = np.sin(2*theta)\n            c3 = np.cos(3*theta)\n            s3 = np.sin(3*theta)\n            c4 = np.cos(4*theta)\n            s4 = np.sin(4*theta)\n            \n            x = 25/12 - 4*c + 3*c2 - (4/3)*c3 + (1/4)*c4\n            y = 4*s - 3*s2 + (4/3)*s3 - (1/4)*s4\n            \n            # The stability region for BDF4 is the exterior of the curve z(theta)\n            # and it extends into the left-half plane.
