# The problem asks for the last digit of A_k^(B_k) - B_k^(A_k) for any positive integer k.
# Finding the last digit is equivalent to calculating the expression modulo 10.

# 1. Analyze the last digit of A_k.
# A_k is defined as (10^(k+1) - 1) / 9.
# For k=1, A_1 = (10^2 - 1) / 9 = 99 / 9 = 11.
# For k=2, A_2 = (10^3 - 1) / 9 = 999 / 9 = 111.
# For any positive integer k, A_k is a repunit, a number consisting of k+1 digits that are all 1s.
# Therefore, the last digit of A_k is always 1.
last_digit_Ak = 1

# 2. Analyze the last digit of B_k.
# B_k is defined as 10^k.
# For k=1, B_1 = 10.
# For k=2, B_2 = 100.
# For any positive integer k, B_k is a multiple of 10.
# Therefore, the last digit of B_k is always 0.

# 3. Calculate the last digit of the first term: A_k^(B_k).
# The last digit of a power depends on the last digit of the base.
# Since the last digit of A_k is 1, any positive integer power of A_k will have a last digit of 1.
# (e.g., last digit of 11^10 is 1, last digit of 111^100 is 1).
# Since k is a positive integer, B_k = 10^k is a positive integer, so this holds.
last_digit_term1 = 1

# 4. Calculate the last digit of the second term: B_k^(A_k).
# B_k is a multiple of 10 for any positive integer k.
# A_k is a positive integer (e.g., 11, 111, ...).
# Any positive integer power of a multiple of 10 is also a multiple of 10, so its last digit is 0.
# (e.g., last digit of 10^11 is 0, last digit of 100^111 is 0).
last_digit_term2 = 0

# 5. Calculate the last digit of the final expression.
# The last digit of (A_k^B_k - B_k^A_k) is found by subtracting the last digits of the terms.
# We compute (last_digit_term1 - last_digit_term2) % 10.
final_last_digit = (last_digit_term1 - last_digit_term2 + 10) % 10
