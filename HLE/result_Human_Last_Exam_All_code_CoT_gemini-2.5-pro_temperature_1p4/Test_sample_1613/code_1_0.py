# The problem is to find the maximum possible number of children under specific visibility conditions.

# Let the set of visible trees be V = {A, B, C, D}.
# Let the set of hidden trees be H = {E, F}.

# A child's position P must satisfy the following:
# 1. For the hidden tree E, there must be a blocking tree Ti from V such that P, Ti, and E are collinear, with Ti between P and E.
# 2. For the hidden tree F, there must be a blocking tree Tj from V such that P, Tj, and F are collinear, with Tj between P and F.

# This means the position of each child is the intersection of two lines: Line(E, Ti) and Line(F, Tj).

# Let's count the number of ways to choose the blocking trees Ti and Tj.
num_visible_trees = 4  # A, B, C, D

# Number of choices for the tree Ti that blocks the view of E.
choices_for_Ti = num_visible_trees
print(f"Number of choices for the tree blocking E: {choices_for_Ti}")

# Now, let's consider the tree Tj that blocks the view of F.
# The position P is the intersection of Line(E, Ti) and Line(F, Tj).
# If Ti and Tj are the same tree (e.g., both are A), then the intersection of Line(E, A) and Line(F, A) is the point A itself.
# The problem states that no two points (children and trees) are coincident, so the child's position P cannot be the same as a tree's position A.
# Therefore, the blocking tree Tj must be different from Ti.
choices_for_Tj = num_visible_trees - 1
print(f"Number of choices for the tree blocking F (must be different from the one blocking E): {choices_for_Tj}")

# The total number of unique, valid positions for children is the number of ordered pairs of distinct blocking trees (Ti, Tj).
# This is a permutation of choosing 2 trees from 4.
maximum_children = choices_for_Ti * choices_for_Tj

# To achieve this maximum, we assume the trees are placed in a generic configuration
# such that all these intersection points are valid and distinct.
print(f"The maximum number of children is the product of these choices.")
print(f"Maximum number of children = {choices_for_Ti} * {choices_for_Tj} = {maximum_children}")
