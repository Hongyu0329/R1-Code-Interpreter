    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark and then find African national flags with the same rank.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nA flag can be viewed as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a pixel's color. To calculate the rank, we assign a unique numerical value to each color. The problem states we should choose these values to *maximize* the rank. This means we avoid choices that create accidental linear dependencies (e.g., setting one color's value to be a multiple of another's, or setting a value to 0).\n\n1.  **Structure of the Danish Flag**: The flag of Denmark has a red field (let's call its value `c1`) and a white Nordic cross (`c2`). The cross is a 2-dimensional feature; it consists of both a horizontal band and a vertical band.\n2.  **Matrix Representation**: If we look at the rows of the flag's matrix:\n    *   Rows that are part of the horizontal white bar will consist only of the value `c2`. Let's call this row pattern `R_white = [c2, c2, c2, ...]`.\n    *   Rows that are in the red field but cross the vertical white bar will consist of `c1` and `c2`. This pattern is `R_red = [c1, ..., c1, c2, c2, c2, c1, ..., c1]`.\n3.  **Calculating the Rank**: We have two distinct row patterns: `R_white` and `R_red`. By choosing `c1` and `c2` to be different non-zero numbers (e.g., 1 and 2), these two vectors are linearly independent (one cannot be a scalar multiple of the other). Since all rows in the flag conform to one of these two patterns, the total number of linearly independent rows is 2. Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Identify African Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nWe are now looking for African flags whose color geometry also results in exactly two linearly independent row or column patterns.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags**: These flags have patterns that are effectively one-dimensional. A simple horizontal or vertical striped flag (e.g., Gabon, Nigeria, Mali) has only one type of column or row vector, respectively, making its rank 1. For example, in a vertical stripe flag, every row is identical.\n*   **Rank 3+ Flags**: These flags have complex 2-dimensional patterns, such as multiple diagonal bands, complex emblems, or divisions into three or more distinct sections, resulting in three or more linearly independent row/column patterns.\n*   **Rank 2 Flags**: These flags have a simple 2-dimensional pattern that produces exactly two types of linearly independent rows or columns. This occurs in two main cases:\n    1.  **A monocolor field with a simple, single-color emblem:** This creates two row types: rows with only the field color, and rows that intersect the emblem (containing both colors).\n    2.  **A layout with a vertical band and two horizontal bands (or vice-versa):** This also creates two distinct row types.\n\n### Step 3: Screening African Flags\n\nApplying this logic, the following African flags have a maximal rank of 2:\n\n1.  **Morocco**: Red field (one pattern) with a green pentagram emblem (creating a second pattern where the emblem lies).\n2.  **Somalia**: Light blue field (one pattern) with a white star emblem (creating a second pattern).\n3.  **Benin**: A vertical green band on the hoist side and two horizontal bands (yellow and red) on the fly side. This layout creates two types of rows: `[green, ..., yellow, ...]` and `[green, ..., red, ...]`. These are two linearly independent patterns.\n4.  **Madagascar**: The same layout as Benin, but with different colors (white, red, green). The rank is also 2 for the same reason.\n\nThe code below will print this explanation and the final list of countries. It also includes a numerical example using the flag of Benin to demonstrate the rank calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies African flags with the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Determining the rank of the flag of Denmark.\")\n    print(\"The flag of Denmark has a red field with a white cross. This 2-dimensional pattern creates two types of linearly independent rows: rows that are all white, and rows that are red and white.

Thus, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Finding African flags with a maximal rank of 2.\")\n    print(\"We need flags whose geometric patterns also produce exactly two linearly independent row or column types.
