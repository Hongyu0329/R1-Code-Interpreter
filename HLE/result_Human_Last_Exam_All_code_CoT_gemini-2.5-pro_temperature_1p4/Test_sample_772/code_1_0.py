    # Step 2: Relate the measure of the worst-case set X to its geometric radius.
    # The problem defines n(N) based on a "worst-case" set X, which is one that
    # expands as slowly as possible under self-multiplication. This occurs when X
    # is a small ball of radius r around the identity element.
    # The measure (volume) of a small ball of radius r in a d-dimensional space
    # is proportional to r^d.
    # We are given that mu(X) = 1/N.
    # So, 1/N is proportional to r^d. This implies r is proportional to (1/N)^(1/d).

    # Step 3: Determine the condition for X^n to cover the group G.
    # If X is a ball of radius r, the product set X^n will be approximately a ball of radius n*r.
    # For X^n to equal G, its radius must be at least the radius of the group G itself,
    # which is a constant value.
    # So, the condition to cover G is: n * r >= Constant.
    # This means n must be proportional to 1/r.
    print("For X^n to cover G, we need n * r > constant, so n must scale as 1/r.")

    # Step 4: Combine the relationships to find how n scales with N.
    # From Step 2, r is proportional to N^(-1/d).
    # From Step 3, n is proportional to 1/r.
    # Substituting r, we find that n is proportional to 1 / (N^(-1/d)) = N^(1/d).
    # The problem states that n(N) is closest to N^alpha.
    # Therefore, alpha = 1/d.
