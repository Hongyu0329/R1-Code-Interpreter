# In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's "Swan Lake", during the Act II Odette variation,
# Svetlana Zakharova performs two distinct sequences of sissone fermes.

# Number of sissone fermes in the first sequence (traveling to one side of the stage)
sissones_first_sequence = 8

# Number of sissone fermes in the second sequence (traveling to the other side)
sissones_second_sequence = 8

# Calculate the total
total_sissones = sissones_first_sequence + sissones_second_sequence

# Display the final calculation and result
print(f"The total number of sissone fermes is the sum of the two sequences.")
print(f"Final Calculation: {sissones_first_sequence} + {sissones_second_sequence} = {total_sissones}")
