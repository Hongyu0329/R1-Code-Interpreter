# The derivation of the nonlinear frequency correction using the method of multiple scales
# results in a term proportional to a polynomial in the polytropic index, gamma.
# Let this polynomial be K(gamma) = A * gamma^3 + B * gamma^2 + C * gamma.

# The coefficients A, B, and C are derived from the terms in the perturbed Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
A = 9.0
B = -19.5
C = 3.0
