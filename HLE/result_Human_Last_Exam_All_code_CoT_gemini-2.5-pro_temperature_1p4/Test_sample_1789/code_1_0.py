    # union of 20 antichains, which means we are looking for the largest subset of
    # divisors of N that does not contain a chain of length 21.

    # Step 3: Calculate the length of the longest chain in the divisor poset of N.

    # sum of the exponents in the prime factorization of N.

    # The answer is the total number of divisors of N.
