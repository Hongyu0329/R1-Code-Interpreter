    print("The combinatorial principles for regular cardinals do not generalize to singular cardinals. Todorcevic's theorem does not hold for singulars.")
    print("Work by Shelah has shown that for singular cardinals, the situation is often reversed. It is consistent with ZFC that KH(kappa+) holds, but the required function does NOT exist.")

    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The existence of the function is guaranteed by KH(kappa+) if kappa is regular, but not if kappa is singular. Therefore, among the given choices, the correct statement is that such a function can only exist for regular cardinals kappa.")
