    # Statement I
    print("Statement I: 'Suboxone could be seen as less safe than Subutex because it contains naloxone, which is included to deter misuse by injection. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal symptoms if the medication is injected, reducing the potential for abuse.'")
    print("  -> Analysis: This is a supportable statement. The naloxone is an abuse-deterrent feature. If the drug is injected by an opioid-dependent person, it causes severe withdrawal symptoms. This unpleasant and medically significant event can be framed as a risk, making it 'less safe' from the perspective of the person misusing it.\n")

    print("  -> Analysis: This is a supportable statement. It reflects standard clinical practice. To avoid any potential risk from naloxone exposure to the fetus or in patients with naloxone hypersensitivity, Subutex is considered the safer and preferred option.\n")
    is_II_correct = True

    # Statement III
    print("Statement III: 'Suboxone could be seen as similarly safe to Subutex because both medications contain buprenorphine... The safety profile in terms of therapeutic use is similar when taken as prescribed.'")
    print("  -> Analysis: This is a supportable statement. When used sublingually as directed, the naloxone in Suboxone is not significantly absorbed and has little to no effect. The safety and therapeutic effects are driven by buprenorphine, making the two medications similarly safe for most patients in routine use.\n")

    # Statement IV
    print("Statement IV: '...largely we donâ€™t know if Suboxone is safer than Subutex...'")

    print("  -> Analysis: This is an incorrect statement. It contains a critical factual error. Suboxone's abuse-deterrent property for injection comes from the PRESENCE of naloxone, not its lack.\n")
