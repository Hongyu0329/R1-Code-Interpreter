    # 1. Atom Composition
    heavy_atoms = 17
    heteroatoms_stated = 5
    ether_oxygens = 5
    tertiary_amines = 2
    # The ether and amine counts require 5 Oxygen and 2 Nitrogen atoms, totaling 7 heteroatoms.
    # This contradicts the stated '5 heteroatoms'. We prioritize the functional group counts.
    actual_heteroatoms = ether_oxygens + tertiary_amines # 7
    num_carbons = heavy_atoms - actual_heteroatoms # 17 - 7 = 10

    # 2. Electron and Saturation Analysis
    valence_electrons = 100
    # To achieve 100 valence electrons with C=10, N=2, O=5, we calculate the number of hydrogens:
    # 100 = 10*4 + H*1 + 2*5 + 5*6  => 100 = 40 + H + 10 + 30 => H = 20
    num_hydrogens = 20
    molecular_formula = "C10H20N2O5"

    # Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C10H20N2O5:
    # DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 2/2 + 1 = 2
    # This perfectly matches the "2 saturated rings" constraint.
    num_rings = 2

    # 3. Functional Groups and Properties
    formal_charge = 0
    num_rotatable_bonds = 6 # This constraint is difficult to reconcile with a compact, bicyclic structure.
    h_bond_donors = 0
    # The molecular weight for C10H20N2O5 (monoisotopic mass ~248.14) does not match the
    # provided 244.179, suggesting the provided value is an error.

    # 4. Structural Deduction
    # A cryptand structure can satisfy many constraints simultaneously.
    # It has 2 tertiary bridgehead amines and can incorporate the 5 ether oxygens
    # and 10 carbon atoms within its 3 connecting bridges to form a bicyclic system (2 rings).
    #
    # Proposed Bridge Composition:
    # Bridge 1: -CH2-O-CH2- (C2H4O)
    # Bridge 2: -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH2- (C4H8O2)
    # Bridge 3: -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH2- (C4H8O2)
    # Total Composition (excluding N): C10 H20 O5
    #
    # This structure satisfies the formula, ring count, and functional group requirements,
    # although it fails the rotatable bond constraint (having 0). Given the contradictions,
    # this is deemed the most plausible solution.

    # The resulting SMILES string for this cryptand is presented below.
