    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of rivers that are mentioned by name in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid.\n2.  Next, I will find the real-world, approximate lengths of these rivers using geographical data.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script to store this data, sort the rivers by length in descending order, and print the top three longest rivers along with their lengths.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # The Aeneid mentions the Danube by its ancient name, Ister.\n    river_data = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube (Ister)': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Ganges': 2525,\n        'Don (Tanais)': 1870,\n        'Tigris': 1850,\n        'Rhine': 1233,\n        'Po (Eridanus)': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406,\n        'Simois': 93, # Small river near Troy\n        'Scamander (Xanthus)': 100, # Small river near Troy\n    }\n\n    # Create a pandas Series for easy sorting\n    rivers = pd.Series(river_data)\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order\n    longest_rivers = rivers.sort_values(ascending=False)\n\n    # Get the top three\n    top_three = longest_rivers.head(3)\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for river, length in top_three.items():\n        print(f\"- {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (Ister) (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
