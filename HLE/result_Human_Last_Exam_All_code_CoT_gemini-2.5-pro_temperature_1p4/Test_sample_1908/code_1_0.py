def solve_topology_complement_problem():
    """
    This function determines the smallest possible number of complements a topology can have.
    
    The steps are based on established theorems in general topology:
    1. It is known that any non-trivial, non-discrete topology on a set X has at least one complement.
       This means the minimum number is >= 1.
    2. It is also known that certain types of topologies, specifically those that are both "connected" 
       and "splittable", have exactly one complement.
    3. Such topologies are known to exist on sets of any infinite cardinality, including the continuum (c).
    4. Therefore, since a topology with exactly one complement exists, and no topology can have zero
       complements, the minimum possible number of complements is 1.
