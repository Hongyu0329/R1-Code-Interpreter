    "My plan is to solve this problem by first understanding the nature of the numbers being summed, and then computationally determining the threshold `N`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Numbers:** The numbers are of the form $f(n) = 2n^2+3n+1$. Factoring this expression gives $f(n) = (2n+1)(n+1)$. I will generate the first few terms of this sequence, starting with $n=1$. Let's call this set of numbers $A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots\\} = \\{6, 15, 28, 45, \\dots\\}$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Problem:** The problem asks for the smallest integer `N` such that all integers $k \\ge N$ can be represented as a sum of *distinct* elements from the set $A$. This is a variation of the Frobenius Coin Problem. The number `N-1` is the largest integer that cannot be expressed in the required form.\n\n3.  **Computational Approach:** Since the set $A$ is infinite, I cannot compute all possible sums. However, I can compute all possible sums using a finite subset of $A$, $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_k\\}$, and find the largest number not representable by this subset. If this largest unreachable number remains constant as I increase `k` (add more terms to the subset), it is highly likely that I have found the true value.\n\n4.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   I will start with a set of reachable sums, initialized to `{0}` (representing the sum of an empty set of numbers).\n    *   I will iteratively introduce the terms $a_k$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n    *   In each iteration `k`, I will update the set of reachable sums by adding the new term `a_k` to all existing sums.\n    *   After each update, I will find the largest integer that is not in the current set of reachable sums.\n    *   I will continue this process until this \"largest unreachable number\" stabilizes for several iterations. The point of stabilization gives us our answer.\n\n5.  **Decomposition:** The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\". I will interpret this as providing an example of how the number `N` can be formed by a sum of distinct terms. Once `N` is found, I will use a backtracking (or greedy) algorithm to find a valid combination of distinct terms from set $A$ that sums up to `N` and print it as an equation.\n\nBased on this plan, I will now write the Python code to perform the computation.\n\n```python\ndef find_frobenius_number_for_distinct_sums():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the smallest number N such that any integer >= N\n    can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form f(n) = 2n^2+3n+1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The function defining the numbers in the set.\n    # f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 1 = (2n+1)(n+1)\n    def f(n):\n        return (2 * n + 1) * (n + 1)\n\n    # We will generate sums using the first `num_terms` to find where the result stabilizes.\n    # Theoretical analysis suggests the answer is found around k=9, so k=15 is safe.\n    num_terms = 15\n    a = [f(n) for n in range(1, num_terms + 1)]\n\n    # `reachable_sums` stores all possible sums of distinct elements.\n    # We initialize it with 0 for the empty sum.\n    reachable_sums = {0}\n\n    last_unreachable = 0\n    stable_count = 0\n    final_unreachable = -1\n\n    # Loop through the terms to build the set of sums\n    for i in range(num_terms):\n        term = a[i]\n        \n        # Add the new term to all previously found sums to generate new sums.\n        new_sums = {s + term for s in reachable_sums}\n        reachable_sums.update(new_sums)\n\n        # We start checking for the largest unreachable number after a few terms (e.g., k>7).\n        if i > 7:\n            max_sum = sum(a[:i+1])\n            \n            # Find the largest number smaller than max_sum that is not in reachable_sums.\n            current_unreachable = -1\n            for num in range(max_sum, 0, -1):\n                if num not in reachable_sums:\n                    current_unreachable = num\n                    break\n\n            if current_unreachable == last_unreachable:\n                stable_count += 1\n            else:\n                stable_count = 0\n            \n            last_unreachable = current_unreachable\n            \n            # If the value has stabilized for a few steps, we can be confident.\n            if stable_count >= 3:\n                final_unreachable = current_unreachable\n                break\n    \n    if final_unreachable == -1:\n         final_unreachable = last_unreachable\n\n    # The number N is the first integer that begins the infinite sequence of representable numbers.\n    N = final_unreachable + 1\n\n    print(f\"The largest number that cannot be written as a sum of distinct terms is: {final_unreachable}\")\n    print(f\"The smallest number N such that any number >= N can be formed is: {N}\")\n\n    # Now, find a decomposition of N into the distinct terms as an example.\n    # We use a greedy backtracking approach to find one such sum.\n    components = []\n    remaining = N\n    \n    # We need the subset of `a` that was used to find the stable N\n    # We can use all terms up to `num_terms` as they are larger than N\n    # and won't affect the sum for N.\n    for term in reversed(a):\n        # A check to see if after subtracting the term, the remainder can be formed\n        # by smaller terms.
