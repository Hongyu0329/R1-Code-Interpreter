    "My plan is to provide a detailed explanation of the key technical differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods. I will analyze each of the multiple-choice options and determine the most accurate and defining distinction. The explanation will be encapsulated within a Python script that prints the reasoning and then outputs the final correct answer choice in the specified format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine\n    cambré derrière and prints the correct answer from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"The most significant and defining technical difference between a cambré derrière (a bend to the back) in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the **B. Placement of hip**.\n\n*   **Vaganova Method:** In the Vaganova tradition, strictness of form is paramount. When executing a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep the hips perfectly square and level, facing the front. The bend is initiated from the upper back, creating a clean, controlled arch. The goal is to maintain the torso's alignment over the supporting leg.\n\n*   **Balanchine Method:** George Balanchine's neoclassical style often emphasizes speed, musicality, and creating longer, more expansive lines. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, it is characteristic to allow the hip of the leg that is behind to lift and open. This \"breaking\" of the hip creates a subtle spiral in the torso and a more dynamic, less vertically stacked line.\n\nWhile other elements can differ stylistically (A, C, D, E), the treatment of the hips is the most fundamental and universally recognized technical distinction between the two methods for this particular step.\n\"\"\"\n    correct_answer = \"B\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"<<<{correct_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```"
