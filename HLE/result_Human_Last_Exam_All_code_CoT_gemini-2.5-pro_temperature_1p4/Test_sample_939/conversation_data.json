    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to check if they fall within the sRGB color gamut.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Gamut:** A color is \"in-gamut\" for a specific color space (like sRGB) if all its components (R, G, B) are valid within that space. For sRGB, this means the linear R, G, and B values must all be between 0 and 1, inclusive. If a color converted from another space (like ROMM RGB) results in an sRGB component less than 0 or greater than 1, it is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented without clipping the values and losing color information.\n2.  **Conversion:** The standard way to convert a color from one linear RGB space to another is by using a 3x3 conversion matrix. The equation is: `sRGB = M * ROMM_RGB`, where `M` is the transformation matrix from ROMM RGB to sRGB.\n3.  **Matrix:** We will use the standard, colorimetrically-accurate matrix for converting from linear ROMM RGB (with a D50 white point) to linear sRGB (with a D65 white point). This matrix accounts for the different primaries and the change in white point (chromatic adaptation).\n4.  **Execution:** The Python script will perform the following steps:\n    *   Define the five ROMM RGB colors to be tested.\n    *   Use the conversion matrix to transform each ROMM RGB color into the sRGB color space.\n    *   For each color, the script will explicitly print the mathematical operation, showing how each new sRGB component is calculated.\n    *   Check if any of the resulting sRGB components are outside the valid [0, 1] range.\n    *   Keep track of the colors that are out-of-gamut.\n    *   Finally, print the numbers of the colors that cannot be represented in sRGB, sorted in ascending order.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_color_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines which of the given ROMM RGB color values fall outside\n    the sRGB color gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # This is the standard conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB.\n    # It accounts for the change in primaries and chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65.\n    # Source: Derived from colour-science for Python library, a standard in color science computation.\n    M = np.array([\n        [2.03977871, -0.89369971, -0.14607899],\n        [-1.08511426, 1.99344429,  0.09166997],\n        [0.14172402, -0.29749498,  1.155771  ]\n    ])\n\n    # The list of ROMM RGB colors to check.\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n    \n    # A small tolerance for floating point comparisons\n    epsilon = 1e-6\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\")\n    print(\"A color cannot be represented if any of its converted sRGB components are < 0 or > 1.\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through each color, convert it, and check if it's in gamut.\n    for index, romm_rgb in sorted(colors.items()):\n        \n        romm_r, romm_g, romm_b = romm_rgb[0], romm_rgb[1], romm_rgb[2]\n        \n        print(f\"--- Checking color {index}: ROMM RGB({romm_r}, {romm_g}, {romm_b}) ---\")\n        \n        # Perform the matrix multiplication to get the linear sRGB values\n        srgb = M @ romm_rgb\n        srgb_r, srgb_g, srgb_b = srgb[0], srgb[1], srgb[2]\n\n        # Print the equation for each component\n        print(\"Conversion calculation:\")\n        print(f\"sRGB R = ({M[0,0]:.4f} * {romm_r}) + ({M[0,1]:.4f} * {romm_g}) + ({M[0,2]:.4f} * {romm_b}) = {srgb_r:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"sRGB G = ({M[1,0]:.4f} * {romm_r}) + ({M[1,1]:.4f} * {romm_g}) + ({M[1,2]:.4f} * {romm_b}) = {srgb_g:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"sRGB B = ({M[2,0]:.4f} * {romm_r}) + ({M[2,1]:.4f} * {romm_g}) + ({M[2,2]:.4f} * {romm_b}) = {srgb_b:.4f}\")\n\n        # Check if any component is outside the [0, 1] range\n        if srgb_r < -epsilon or srgb_r > 1 + epsilon or \\\n           srgb_g < -epsilon or srgb_g > 1 + epsilon or \\\n           srgb_b < -epsilon or srgb_b > 1 + epsilon:\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(str(index))\n            print(\"Status: CANNOT be represented (components are outside the [0, 1] range).\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Status: Can be represented (all components are within the [0, 1] range).\\n\")\n\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(out_of_gamut_indices)\n\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {final_answer}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_color_gamut()\n```"
