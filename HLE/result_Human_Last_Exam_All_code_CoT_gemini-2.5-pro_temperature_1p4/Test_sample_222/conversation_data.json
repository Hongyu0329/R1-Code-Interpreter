    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Request:** The problem asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence, `y(n) = {x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`. A standard N-point DFT is defined for a sequence of length N. The most reasonable interpretation for this non-standard request is a **decimation-in-frequency** operation. This means we first calculate the 8-point DFT of the sequence `y(n)` and then decimate (downsample) it by a factor of 2 in the frequency domain.\n\n2.  **Calculate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`:** The 8-point sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving the 4-point sequences `x(n)` (even samples) and `h(n)` (odd samples). The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be constructed from the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` using the standard Cooley-Tukey FFT \"butterfly\" synthesis formula:\n    *   For `k` from 0 to 3: `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n    *   For `k` from 0 to 3: `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n    where `W_8^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/8)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\n3.  **Decimate to get the 4-point DFT `Z(m)`:** After computing the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`, we find the desired 4-point result `Z(m)` by taking every second sample of `Y(k)`:\n    *   `Z(m) = Y(2m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** The Python code below will implement these steps. It will use the `numpy` library to handle complex arithmetic efficiently. It will first define the input DFTs `X` and `H`, then calculate the intermediate 8-point DFT `Y`, and finally extract the 4-point DFT `Z` and print each of its components.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given 4-point DFTs from the problem.\n# X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]\n# H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]\nX = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=np.complex128)\nH = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j], dtype=np.complex128)\n\n# The new sequence is an 8-point sequence y(n) formed by interleaving\n# x(n) (even samples) and h(n) (odd samples). We need to find its DFT.\n# The size of the resulting DFT is N=8.\nN = 8\n\n# Initialize the 8-point DFT Y(k) as an array of zeros.\nY = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.complex128)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the 8-point DFT Y(k) using the DIT-FFT synthesis formula.\n# Y(k)     = X(k) + W_N^k * H(k)\n# Y(k+N/2) = X(k) - W_N^k * H(k)\n# We compute this for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n# Calculate the twiddle factors W_8^k for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nk_half = np.arange(N // 2)\nW = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k_half / N)\n\n# Calculate the term T(k) = W_8^k * H(k)\nT = W * H\n\n# Apply the butterfly formulas\nY[:N//2] = X + T\nY[N//2:] = X - T\n\n# Step 3: The problem asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of the 8-point sequence.\n# We interpret this as decimating the 8-point DFT Y(k) in frequency,\n# by taking every second sample to produce a 4-point sequence Z(m).\n# Z(m) = Y(2m) for m = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nZ = Y[::2]\n\n# Step 4: Print the final 4-point DFT Z(m).\n# The format fulfills the requirement \"output each number in the final equation\".\nprint(\"The resulting 4-point DFT, Z(m), is:\")\nfor m in range(len(Z)):\n    # The calculated values have integer real and imaginary parts.\n    val = Z[m]\n    print(f\"Z({m}) = {val}\")\n\n```\n<<<[1.+0.j, -1.-1.j, 1.+0.j, -1.+1.j]>>>"
