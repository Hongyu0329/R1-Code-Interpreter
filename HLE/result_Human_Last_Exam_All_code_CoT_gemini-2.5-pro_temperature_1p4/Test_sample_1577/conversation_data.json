    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the General Formula:** The ground state degeneracy of the toric code is given by `GSD = 2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. The value of `k` is a topological invariant of the surface on which the code is defined. For a surface with genus `g`, `n_s` smooth boundaries (also called electric boundaries), and `n_r` rough boundaries (also called magnetic boundaries), the number of logical qubits is given by the well-established formula:\n    `k = 2g + n_s + n_r - 1`\n\n2.  **Interpret the Geometry:** The problem specifies a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. This description typically implies a planar geometry, where the code is laid out on a 2D plane (which is topologically a disk). A disk has a genus `g=0`. The `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes are \"punched out\" of this disk, creating internal boundaries. The disk itself has an outer boundary, which must also be characterized as either smooth or rough. So, we have a total of `n+m+1` boundaries.\n\n3.  **Calculate `k`:** We need to consider two cases for the outer boundary of the disk.\n\n    *   **Case 1: The outer boundary is smooth.**\n        In this scenario, the total number of smooth boundaries is `n_s = n + 1` (the `n` inner holes plus the outer boundary). The number of rough boundaries remains `n_r = m`. The genus is `g=0`.\n        Using the formula:\n        `k = 2*0 + (n + 1) + m - 1 = n + m`\n\n    *   **Case 2: The outer boundary is rough.**\n        In this scenario, the total number of smooth boundaries is `n_s = n`. The number of rough boundaries is `n_r = m + 1` (the `m` inner holes plus the outer boundary). The genus is still `g=0`.\n        Using the formula:\n        `k = 2*0 + n + (m + 1) - 1 = n + m`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** In both possible interpretations of the planar geometry, the number of logical qubits `k` is `n + m`. Therefore, the ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`. This matches option A.\n\nThe following Python code expresses this final formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the formula for the ground space degeneracy of the toric code\n    on a planar surface with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Symbolic representation for the number of holes\n    n_smooth_holes = 'n'\n    m_rough_holes = 'm'\n\n    # The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n    # For a planar geometry (genus g=0) with an outer boundary, we found that\n    # the number of logical qubits k is the sum of the inner smooth and rough holes.\n    k = f\"{m_rough_holes} + {n_smooth_holes}\"\n\n    # The final equation for the GSD is 2^(m+n).\n    # As requested, we will print the components of this equation.\n    base = 2\n\n    print(f\"The formula for the ground space degeneracy is: {base}^({k})\")\n    print(f\"Base of the exponent: {base}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent term 1 (number of smooth holes): {n_smooth_holes}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent term 2 (number of rough holes): {m_rough_holes}\")\n\nsolve_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
