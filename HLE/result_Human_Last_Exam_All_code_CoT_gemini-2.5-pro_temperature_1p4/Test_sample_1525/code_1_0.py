    Analyzes five statements about a Datalog claim and counts the correct ones.

    # Statement A: "The recursive definition of Pk ... introduce an order-dependence that might not be well-defined..."
    # Analysis: A Datalog program is a set of rules, which is unordered. Defining a process based on
    # "order of appearance" relies on a specific textual representation and is not a formal property of the program.
    # This makes the definition itself weak from a logical standpoint. Thus, the statement is a valid critique.
    is_A_correct = True

    # Statement B: "The claim states that gamma[gamma^-1[P]] = P. ... the subsequent application of gamma may not
    # recover the original program P uniquely."
    # Analysis: The segregation gamma^-1[P] creates a set of "refined" programs {P_1, P_2, ...}.
    # Each P_i is made from P by replacing constants 'c' with pre-images 'c'' where gamma(c')=c.
    # Applying gamma to any P_i maps each c' back to c, so gamma[P_i] is always P. The recovery is unique (to P).
    # The statement claims it may not be unique, which is false.
    is_B_correct = False

    # Statement C: "When you aggregate facts, you potentially lose information. ... This means
    # gamma^-1[gamma[P]] might not be identical to P."
    # Analysis: This statement describes the information-losing nature of the gamma operator.
    # If P has a constant 'c1' and gamma(c1)=a, gamma(c2)=a, then gamma[P] contains 'a'.
    # Applying gamma^-1 to gamma[P] would expand 'a' to its full pre-image {a, c1, c2, ...},
    # which does not uniquely recover the original P. The statement is correct.
    is_C_correct = True

    # Statement D: "...it's not clear if gamma^-1[S0] is meant to generate all possible combinations ... or just replace with a single representative."
    # Analysis: The recursive formula for segregation uses a union operator (âˆª) over ALL possible replacements
    # from the pre-image set. This explicitly means taking all combinations, not just picking one.
    # The definition is not ambiguous in this regard. The statement is incorrect.
    is_D_correct = False

    # Statement E: "The claim essentially states that if a Datalog program and a set of facts are already at a
    # stable level of granularity, further attempts to coarsen or refine that granularity will have no effect.
    # In other words, coarse-grained inference does not make any loss of information in such a case."
    # Analysis: This is an excellent high-level interpretation of the claim. The claim `gamma[...]=P(S0)`
    # means that the result of direct "coarse-grained" inference `P(S0)` is the same as the result of a
    # detour through the "fine-grained" world. This implies that no relevant information is lost.
    # The statement is a correct interpretation.
    is_E_correct = True

    # Tally the number of correct statements.
