    "To solve this problem, we need to apply some deep theorems from the arithmetic geometry of curves. Here is a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conditions:** The problem concerns a curve `C` of genus `g=4`. The crucial constraint is that its Jacobian variety, `Jac(C)`, has good reduction.\n\n2.  **Apply Raynaud's Theorem:** A fundamental theorem by Jean Raynaud (later refined by others like Saito and Coleman) describes the structure of the stable reduction of a curve whose Jacobian has good reduction. For a curve of genus `g ≥ 2`, `Jac(C)` has good reduction if and only if the special fiber of the stable model of `C`, let's call it `C_s`, satisfies two conditions:\n    a. The irreducible components of `C_s` are all smooth curves of genus 0 or 1.\n    b. The dual graph of `C_s`, which represents components as vertices and intersection points as edges, is a tree.\n\n3.  **Use the Genus Formula:** For a stable curve `C_s` whose dual graph is a tree, the arithmetic genus is simply the sum of the genera of its irreducible components.\n    *   `g = p_a(C) = p_a(C_s) = Σ p_a(C_i)`\n    *   Given `g=4`, and `p_a(C_i)` can only be 0 or 1, this sum must be `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`.\n    *   This means the stable reduction `C_s` must consist of exactly 4 components of genus 1 (elliptic curves) and any number of components of genus 0 (rational curves, which act as \"bridges\").\n\n4.  **Define the \"Type\" of Reduction:** The combinatorial \"type\" of such a stable reduction is determined by the structure of its *principal graph*. The principal graph has vertices corresponding only to the components with genus > 0 (our 4 elliptic curves). An edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding elliptic curves are connected by a path made entirely of genus 0 components in the full dual graph. The theory ensures that this principal graph must also be a tree.\n\n5.  **Solve the Combinatorial Problem:** The problem is now reduced to a purely combinatorial one: How many non-isomorphic trees can be formed with 4 vertices?\n\n6.  **Enumerate and Code:** We will enumerate the non-isomorphic trees with 4 vertices and sum them up in a Python script. There are two such trees:\n    *   The **path graph P₄**, where the vertices are arranged in a line.\n    *   The **star graph K₁,₃**, where one central vertex is connected to the other three.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this final enumeration step and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve\n    with a good reduction Jacobian.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 4\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the number of types of stable reductions for a curve of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"The condition that the Jacobian has good reduction is very strong.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to the theory of stable reduction (due to Raynaud, Saito, Coleman):\")\n    print(f\"1.
