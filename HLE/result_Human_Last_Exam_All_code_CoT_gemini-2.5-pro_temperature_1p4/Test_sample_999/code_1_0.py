# The user wants to identify the incorrect statement about neural network quantization.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis, statement D is the most likely incorrect statement.
# Statement D claims that non-uniform quantization can bring "substantial" speed-up on Ampere GPUs
# compared to FP16, even without using INT8 GEMM kernels.
# This is generally false. While some speedup is possible in memory-bound cases due to
# reduced memory traffic, the loss of accelerated INT8 computation and the added overhead of
# on-the-fly dequantization mean that the speedup is rarely "substantial" and the method is often
# slower than native FP16 in compute-bound scenarios. The other statements (A, B, C, E)
# describe correct and established concepts in neural network quantization.

# Let's print the identified incorrect statement's letter.
incorrect_statement_letter = "D"

print(f"The statement that is not correct is: {incorrect_statement_letter}")

# The full text of the incorrect statement is:
# D. Non-uniform quantization of neural network weights on NVIDIA GPUs with the Ampere architecture
# may still bring substantial inference runtime speed-up for certain applications compared to FP16,
# despite its inability to utilize INT8 GEMM kernels.
