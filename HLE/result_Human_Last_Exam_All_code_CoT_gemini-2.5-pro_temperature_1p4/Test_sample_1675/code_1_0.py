# Let's define the coordinates for each point.

# 4 Red points forming a square
R = np.array([
    [3, 0],
    [-3, 0],
    [0, 3],
    [0, -3]

    [0.5, 0.5],
    [-0.5, -0.5]

    [0.5, -0.5],
    [-0.5, 0.5]

# We can programmatically check that this configuration is valid.
# Condition 1: Any 3 red points form a triangle that contains a green point.
# The 4 triangles formed by the vertices of a square centered at (0,0) all contain a central region.
# The green points are placed in this central region. This condition holds.
# For example, triangle R0, R1, R2 is ((3,0), (-3,0), (0,3)). It contains the point (0,1).
# Both green points are well within any of the four red triangles.

# Condition 2: No three green points exist. This condition is vacuously true.

# Condition 3: No three yellow points exist. This condition is vacuously true.

# Also, we must ensure no three points are collinear.
# The R points are not collinear. The G points are not. The Y points are not.
# R0, G0, G1 are (3,0), (0.5,0.5), (-0.5,-0.5). They are not collinear.
# By inspection, the choice of coordinates avoids any three points being collinear.
