# The solution to the three-part puzzle.

# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School",
# where a horse is shod with special shoes to fake cow tracks.
answer_A = 7

# Part B: The sum of the numbers must be a multiple of 8.
# Given A=7 and C=7, the sum is 14 + B.
# For the total sum to be 16 (a multiple of 8), B must be 2.
# The theme is freedom, connected through the ideas of artifice, deception, and escape (camouflage).
answer_B = 2

# Part C: Nabokov's most intense experience with intricate annotation and
# back-referencing was his massive translation of "Eugene Onegin".
answer_C = 7

# Print the final answer as three numbers separated by spaces.
print(f"{answer_A} {answer_B} {answer_C}")
