    print("Background: In nonstandard analysis, the continuity of a standard function f: X -> Y is characterized by how its extension f* acts on points that are infinitesimally close.")
    print("The relation 'a ~ b' means 'a is infinitesimally close to b'.")
    print("A standard point is a point in the original space X. A nonstandard point is any point in the extension X*.\n")

    print("Definition of Continuity at a standard point x_0 in X:")
    print("A function f is continuous at a standard point x_0 if for any point x_1 (standard or nonstandard) that is infinitesimally close to x_0, the image f(x_1) is infinitesimally close to f(x_0).")
    print("A function f is continuous on X if it is continuous at every standard point in X.\n")
    
    print("Definition of Uniform Continuity on X:")
    print("A function f is uniformly continuous if for any two points x_0 and x_1 (both can be nonstandard) that are infinitesimally close, their images f(x_0) and f(x_1) are also infinitesimally close.\n")

    print("Analyzing the Options:")
    print("----------------------------------------")

    # Option A
    print("A. forall x_0, x_1 in X: x_0 ~ x_1 ==> f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)")
    print("   Analysis: This only considers standard points from X. In standard spaces, two points are infinitesimally close only if they are identical. This makes the condition trivial and true for any function, so it does not define continuity.\n")

    # Option B
    print("B. forall x_0 in X, forall x_1 in X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ==> f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)")
    print("   Analysis: This states that for any standard point x_0, if a nonstandard point x_1 is in the monad of x_0 (i.e., x_1 ~ x_0), then f(x_1) is in the monad of f(x_0). This must hold for all standard points x_0. This is precisely the nonstandard definition of continuity for the function f on its domain X. This is the correct answer.\n")

    # Option C
    print("C. forall x_0, x_1 in X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ==> f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)")
    print("   Analysis: This requires the condition to hold for ANY pair of infinitesimally close points, including pairs where both points are nonstandard (e.g., infinite hyperreals). This is the definition of UNIFORM continuity, which is a stronger condition than continuity. For example, f(x) = x^2 is continuous on R but not uniformly continuous, and it satisfies B but not C.\n")

    # Option D
    print("D. forall x_0, x_1 in X: f(x_0) ~ f(x_1) ==> x_0 ~ x_1")
    print("   Analysis: For standard points, this means f(x_0) = f(x_1) implies x_0 = x_1. This is the definition of an injective (one-to-one) function, not continuity.\n")

    # Option E

    print("   Analysis: This is the converse of the continuity condition. A continuous function does not need to satisfy this. For example, f(x)=x^2 is continuous. Let x_0=1 and x_1 = -1 + epsilon (where epsilon is a non-zero infinitesimal). Then f(x_1) ~ 1 = f(x_0), but x_1 is not infinitesimally close to x_0=1.\n")

    # Option F
    print("F. forall x_0, x_1 in X*: f(x_0) ~ f(x_1) ==> x_0 ~ x_1")
