    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Board and Attacks**: The board is a 5x5 grid that wraps around both horizontally and vertically (a torus). Two queens at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this translates to:\n    *   **Row attack**: `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column attack**: `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Main diagonal attack**: `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5`\n    *   **Anti-diagonal attack**: `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`\n    A valid placement of 4 queens requires that all 4 queens are on distinct rows, columns, main diagonals, and anti-diagonals.\n\n2.  **Computational Strategy**: The problem can be solved by iterating through all possible ways to place 4 queens on the 25 available squares and checking each placement for validity.\n    *   The total number of ways to choose 4 squares from 25 is given by the combination formula `C(25, 4)`, which equals 12,650. This number is small enough to check computationally.\n    *   We will use Python's `itertools.combinations` to generate every possible placement of 4 queens.\n\n3.  **Validation Logic**: For each placement of 4 queens, we will check if it's a valid solution. A placement is valid if the row numbers, column numbers, main diagonal indices, and anti-diagonal indices for all four queens are unique. We can use sets to efficiently track the indices and check for duplicates.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: The Python script will:\n    *   Define the board size (`N=5`) and the number of queens (`NUM_QUEENS=4`).\n    *   Generate all combinations of `NUM_QUEENS` squares from the `N*N` board.\n    *   For each combination, check if it satisfies the non-attacking conditions using the logic described above.\n    *   Count the number of valid combinations.\n    *   Finally, print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n    \n    # Create a list of all squares on the board, represented as (row, col) tuples.\n    board_squares = [(r, c) for r in range(N) for c in range(N)]\n    \n    solution_count = 0\n    \n    # Generate all possible combinations of placing NUM_QUEENS on the board.\n    possible_placements = itertools.combinations(board_squares, NUM_QUEENS)\n    \n    # Iterate through each combination to check if it's a valid solution.\n    for placement in possible_placements:\n        # A placement is a tuple of queen positions, e.g., ((r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...)\n        \n        # Use sets to efficiently check for uniqueness of rows, columns, and diagonals.\n        rows = set()\n        cols = set()\n        main_diagonals = set()  # Identified by (r - c) mod N\n        anti_diagonals = set()  # Identified by (r + c) mod N\n        \n        is_valid_placement = True\n        for r, c in placement:\n            # Check for row conflict\n            if r in rows:\n                is_valid_placement = False\n                break\n            rows.add(r)\n            \n            # Check for column conflict\n            if c in cols:\n                is_valid_placement = False\n                break\n            cols.add(c)\n            \n            # Check for main diagonal conflict (toroidal)\n            main_diag_index = (r - c) % N\n            if main_diag_index in main_diagonals:\n                is_valid_placement = False\n                break\n            main_diagonals.add(main_diag_index)\n            \n            # Check for anti-diagonal conflict (toroidal)\n            anti_diag_index = (r + c) % N\n            if anti_diag_index in anti_diagonals:\n                is_valid_placement = False\n                break\n            anti_diagonals.add(anti_diag_index)\n            \n        if is_valid_placement:\n            solution_count += 1\n            \n    # The final \"equation\" is the result of this computation.\n    # We print the final count, which is the solution.\n    # The numbers in this final output are the board size, number of queens, and the total ways.\n    print(f\"Number of ways to place {NUM_QUEENS} non-attacking queens on a {N}x{N} toroidal board is: {solution_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<250>>>\n```"
