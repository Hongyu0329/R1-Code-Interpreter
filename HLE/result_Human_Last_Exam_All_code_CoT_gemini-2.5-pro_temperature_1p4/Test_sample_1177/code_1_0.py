    notice_day = 5
    pickup_day = 6
    year = 2022

    # --- Legal Analysis Steps ---

    # Rule 2 of the Sale of Goods Act is key here. It states that for a contract
    # for specific goods where the seller must do something to put them into a
    # "deliverable state", the property (and risk) does not pass until:
    # 1. That thing is done, AND
    # 2. The buyer has notice that it has been done.

    # Let's check if the conditions were met before the flood on the night of June 5th/6th.

    # Condition 1: Was the repair work done?
    # The text states: "As promised, Jake replaced the screen on the MacBook Pro"
    repair_completed = True

    # Condition 2: Did the buyer (Luke) have notice that the work was done?
    # On June 5, Jake sent a text that the laptop "will be ready for Luke to pick up on the following day."
    # This text serves as legally sufficient notice to the buyer that the seller
    # has completed the required action and the goods are now in a deliverable state.
    notice_given = True

    # --- Forming the Conclusion ---
    # Since both conditions (repair_completed and notice_given) were met on June 5,
    # the property and the associated risk of loss transferred to the buyer, Luke, at that time.
    # The flood happened after the risk had already passed.

    print(f"Component 1: A purchase price of {purchase_price} dollars was established.")
    print(f"Component 2: An agreement was made on June {agreement_day}, {year}, but the item was not yet deliverable.")
    print(f"Component 3: The seller completed the repairs to make the item deliverable.")
    print(f"Component 4: The seller gave notice to the buyer on June {notice_day} that the item would be ready for pickup on June {pickup_day}.")
