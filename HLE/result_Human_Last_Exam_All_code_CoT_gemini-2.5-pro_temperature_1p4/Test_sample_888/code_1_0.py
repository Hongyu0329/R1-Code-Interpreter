# Step 1: Determine the constants K1, K2, K3, K4 by comparing the derived
# denominator of the coefficient A_m with the given parametric form.
# The derived denominator is (1/(4*sqrt(lambda))) * (2*l*sqrt(lambda) - sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda)))
# The given form is (1/(K1*sqrt(lambda))) * (K2*l*sqrt(lambda) + K3*sin(K4*l*sqrt(lambda)))

# From comparison:
K1 = 4
K2 = 2
K3 = -1
K4 = 2

# Step 2: Determine the constant K.
# The boundary value problem shows that all eigenvalues lambda_m are strictly positive.
# This means sqrt(lambda_m) > 0.
# The problem states sqrt(lambda_m) > K.
# The only constant lower bound K that can be determined from the problem statement
# without depending on parameters l or k is 0.
K = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the product K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4.
product = K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Step 4: Output the equation with the found values.
