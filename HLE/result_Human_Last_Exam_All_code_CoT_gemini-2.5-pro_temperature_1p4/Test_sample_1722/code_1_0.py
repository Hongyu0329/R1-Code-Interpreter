    This function solves for the minimum hallway length 'n' based on a known
    result from automata theory.

    The problem is equivalent to finding the minimum length 'n' of two distinct
    strings that are k-indistinguishable but (k+1)-distinguishable.
    We are given the case where a 2-state memory (k=2) provides no advantage over
    a 1-state memory, but a 3-state memory (k+1=3) does.

    The formula for this minimal length is n = k * (k + 1).
