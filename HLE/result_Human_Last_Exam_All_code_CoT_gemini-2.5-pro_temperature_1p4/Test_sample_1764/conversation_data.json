    "To find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$, we need to determine the minimum value for the count of such embeddings over all possible choices of $X$ and $B$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will investigate if it's possible for the number of isometric embeddings to be zero.\n2.  If I can find a specific example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which no isometric embedding exists, this means the number of embeddings is 0 for that pair.\n3.  Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, finding a single case where it is 0 proves that the minimum possible number is 0.\n4.  I will construct a simple ultrametric space $X$ with three points and a simple Banach space $B$ (the real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$).\n5.  I will then demonstrate through logical deduction and equations that no embedding is possible for this specific case.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a\n    finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B by providing a\n    counterexample where the number of embeddings is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define a finite ultrametric space X.\")\n    print(\"Let X be a set of three points {p1, p2, p3}.\")\n    print(\"Let the distances be defined as follows:\")\n    \n    # Define the distances for the space X\n    dist_p1_p2 = 1\n    dist_p1_p3 = 2\n    dist_p2_p3 = 2\n    \n    print(f\"d(p1, p2) = {dist_p1_p2}\")\n    print(f\"d(p1, p3) = {dist_p1_p3}\")\n    print(f\"d(p2, p3) = {dist_p2_p3}\")\n    print(\"This space is ultrametric because for any three points, the distance between two\")\n    print(\"is less than or equal to the maximum of the other two distances.\")\n    print(f\"For instance, d(p1, p3) <= max(d(p1, p2), d(p2, p3)) is {dist_p1_p3} <= max({dist_p1_p2}, {dist_p2_p3}), which is true.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Define a Banach space B.\")\n    print(\"Let B be the Banach space of the real numbers, R, with the standard norm (the absolute value).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Search for an isometric embedding f: X -> B.\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding requires finding points x1, x2, x3 in R such that their distances match those in X.\")\n    print(\"The required distance equations are:\")\n    print(f\"|x1 - x2| = {dist_p1_p2}\")\n    print(f\"|x1 - x3| = {dist_p1_p3}\")\n    print(f\"|x2 - x3| = {dist_p2_p3}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Analyze the condition in the space B = R.\")\n    print(\"A key property of any three points on the real line (a 1D space) is that one point must lie between the other two.\")\n    print(\"If x2 is between x1 and x3, then the distances must satisfy the equation: |x1 - x3| = |x1 - x2| + |x2 - x3|.\")\n    print(\"In general, for any three points in R, one of the three distances must be the sum of the other two.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's check if our set of distances {1, 2, 2} satisfies this property.\")\n    \n    print(\"Possibility 1: Does 1 + 2 = 2?
