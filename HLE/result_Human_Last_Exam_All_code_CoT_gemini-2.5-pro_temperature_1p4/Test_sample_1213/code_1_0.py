def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the Go puzzle by identifying all of White's
    initial moves that lead to a guaranteed kill of the Black groups.

    The solution is based on analyzing the liberties and vital points
    of the Black groups and determining the outcomes of sequences of moves.

    The identified killing moves are:
    - B2: This is the most effective move (a 'tesuji'), as it puts one black group
      in 'atari' (one liberty remaining) and cripples the others, leading to a
      forced capture sequence.
    - A1, A3, A4, B1: These moves also initiate a kill sequence. While Black's
      best response is to connect its groups by playing at B2, White has a
      correct follow-up plan to capture the resulting large group. White must
      play precisely to prevent Black from escaping, but a winning path exists
      for each of these initial moves.
