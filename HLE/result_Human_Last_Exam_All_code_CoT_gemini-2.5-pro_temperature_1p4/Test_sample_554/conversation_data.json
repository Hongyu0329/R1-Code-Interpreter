    "Of course. Here is a Python script to calculate the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\nFirst, I need to establish the chemical structure of the molecule. A \"nanocar\" typically refers to a molecule synthesized by the research group of Prof. James Tour, which has a chassis and four fullerene \"wheels.\" The term \"perfluoro-\" means that all hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon chassis are replaced with fluorine atoms. My plan is to:\n1.  Identify the number of hydrogen atoms on the central ring of the nanocar's chassis.\n2.  Identify the number of hydrogen atoms on the four \"axle\" components of the chassis.\n3.  Sum these values to find the total number of hydrogens that would be replaced by fluorine atoms.\n4.  The final sum will be the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar\n    based on the structure of the well-known nanocar molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The term \"perfluoro-\" indicates all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine.\n    # We need to count the hydrogens on the nanocar's chassis.\n    # The nanocar structure consists of a central body and four axles.\n\n    # 1. The central body is a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring.\n    # A normal benzene ring has 6 hydrogens. Since 4 are replaced by axle connections,\n    # 2 hydrogen atoms remain on the central ring.\n    h_central_ring = 2\n\n    # 2. There are four \"axles\" connected to the central ring.\n    num_axles = 4\n\n    # 3. Each axle contains a para-disubstituted phenylene group (-C6H4-).\n    # This means each axle ring has 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    h_per_axle_ring = 4\n\n    # Calculate the total number of hydrogens on the four axles.\n    total_h_on_axles = num_axles * h_per_axle_ring\n\n    # The total number of hydrogens is the sum of hydrogens on the central ring and the axles.\n    # This is equal to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version.\n    total_fluorine_atoms = h_central_ring + total_h_on_axles\n\n    print(\"To find the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar, we count the hydrogens on the chassis that would be replaced.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Number of hydrogens on the central ring: {h_central_ring}\")\n    print(f\"Number of hydrogens on the {num_axles} axle rings: {num_axles} * {h_per_axle_ring} = {total_h_on_axles}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The total number of fluorine atoms is the sum of these values.\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {h_central_ring} + {total_h_on_axles} = {total_fluorine_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"\\nA hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain {total_fluorine_atoms} fluorine atoms.\")\n\ncalculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
