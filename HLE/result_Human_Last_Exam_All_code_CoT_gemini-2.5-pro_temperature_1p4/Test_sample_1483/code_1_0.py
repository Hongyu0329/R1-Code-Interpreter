# The user's question is to find the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
# of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

# Let K be the cardinality we are looking for.

# Step 1: Establish a theoretical lower bound for K.
# Based on a theorem by Mazurkiewicz, a decomposable continuum X can be written
# as the union of two indecomposable proper subcontinua, A and B.
# Using properties of indecomposable continua, it can be proven that
# both A and B must be regular subcontinua in X.
# As A and B are distinct, this implies that any such continuum has at least
# two regular proper subcontinua.
lower_bound = 2

# Step 2: Provide an example that achieves this lower bound.
# An example continuum is the union of two pseudo-arcs at a single point.
# A pseudo-arc is an indecomposable continuum.
# This construction yields a decomposable continuum whose only regular proper
# subcontinua are the two original pseudo-arcs.
# This confirms that a cardinality of 2 is achievable.
example_cardinality = 2

# Step 3: Conclude the smallest possible cardinality.
# The smallest possible cardinality must be greater than or equal to the lower bound.
# Since we have an example that meets the lower bound, this must be the minimum.
# We can express this with the following variables and print the result.
final_answer = lower_bound
print("Smallest possible cardinality = " + str(final_answer))
