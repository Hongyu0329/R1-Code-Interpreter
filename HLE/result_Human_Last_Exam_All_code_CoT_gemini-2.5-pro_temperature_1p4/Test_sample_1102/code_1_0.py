This level of current is typically used for welding very thin sheet metal (e.g., less than 1 mm thick) and would be insufficient to properly melt the base material and filler wire to create a sound root pass with good fusion on a blade tip. This would likely result in a 'cold' weld with poor integrity.")
    print(f" - A current of 100 A (Choice C) is a more robust and common parameter for TIG welding materials of this type and thickness. While the travel speed of {travel_speed_mm_s} mm/s is slow, the long and less focused arc (due to the 6 mm gap) reduces the energy density on the workpiece. Therefore, 100 A is a reasonable current to ensure adequate heat input for a stable molten pool and successful material deposition for the root pass.")
