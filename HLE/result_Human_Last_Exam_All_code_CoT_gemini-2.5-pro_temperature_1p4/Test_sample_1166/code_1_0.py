def solve_lebesgue_integrability():
    """
    Identifies which types of functions from a given list are necessarily
    Lebesgue integrable.

    The analysis is based on the definition of Lebesgue integrability:
    A function f is Lebesgue integrable if it is measurable and ∫|f|dμ < ∞.

    The correct options are determined as follows:
    - F: A continuous function on a compact set [a,b] is measurable and bounded,
         and the domain has finite measure. Hence, it is integrable.
    - L: This is the definition of a Lebesgue integrable function.
    - M: A bounded continuous function on a set of finite measure ((a,b)) is
         measurable and its integral is bounded. Hence, it is integrable.

    Other options are not necessarily integrable due to issues like lack of
    measurability, unboundedness, or infinite measure of the domain.
