    "This is a well-known problem in mathematics called \"circle packing in a circle\". For packing 14 identical circles, the arrangement is conjectured to be optimal but not rigorously proven. The established configuration leads to a specific formula for the radius of the larger containing circle.\n\nMy plan is to use this known formula. The radius `R` of the large circle is given by `R = r * (1 + sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))`, where `r` is the radius of the small circles.\n\nI will write a Python script to:\n1.  Set the small circle radius `r` to 1.\n2.  Use the `math` library to calculate `sqrt(2)` and `sqrt(6)`.\n3.  Compute `R` using the formula.\n4.  Print the equation with all the calculated numerical values substituted in.\n5.  Finally, I will present the result rounded to 4 significant digits.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_packing_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The radius of the small circles\n    r = 1.0\n\n    # The best-known packing for 14 circles gives the radius of the\n    # containing circle R with the formula: R = r * (1 + sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))\n    \n    # Calculate the necessary square roots\n    val_sqrt_2 = math.sqrt(2)\n    val_sqrt_6 = math.sqrt(6)\n    \n    # Calculate the final radius R\n    R = r * (1 + val_sqrt_2 + val_sqrt_6)\n\n    # As requested, printing the final equation with each number.\n    print(\"The formula for the radius 'R' of the large circle is:\")\n    print(\"R = r * (1 + sqrt(2) + sqrt(6))\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values:\")\n    print(f\"r = {r}\")\n    print(f\"sqrt(2) = {val_sqrt_2}\")\n    print(f\"sqrt(6) = {val_sqrt_6}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation becomes:\")\n    print(f\"R = {r} * (1 + {val_sqrt_2} + {val_sqrt_6})\")\n    \n    # Calculate and print the final result before rounding\n    total_ratio = 1 + val_sqrt_2 + val_sqrt_6\n    print(f\"R = {r} * ({total_ratio})\")\n    print(f\"R = {R}\")\n\n    # Format the result to 4 significant digits.\n    # The value is 4.8637...
