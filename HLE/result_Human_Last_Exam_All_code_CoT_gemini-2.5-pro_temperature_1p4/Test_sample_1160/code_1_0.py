# The problem is to calculate the limit L = lim_{n->inf} ln(1/p_n) / ln(n).
#
# Step 1: Find the scaling of p_n for large n.
# Based on the potential theory of random walks, the escape probability p_n
# for a starting point on the center of a face of a cube of side 2n
# is known to scale as 1/n.
# So, p_n â‰ˆ C/n for some constant C.

# Step 2: Substitute this scaling into the limit expression.
# The term ln(1/p_n) becomes:
# ln(1/(C/n)) = ln(n/C) = ln(n) - ln(C)

# Step 3: Evaluate the limit.
# The expression becomes:
# L = lim_{n->inf} (ln(n) - ln(C)) / ln(n)
#   = lim_{n->inf} (ln(n)/ln(n) - ln(C)/ln(n))
#   = lim_{n->inf} (1 - ln(C)/ln(n))

# As n approaches infinity, ln(n) also approaches infinity.
# The term ln(C)/ln(n) approaches 0.
# So, L = 1 - 0 = 1.

# The final equation is: lim_{n->inf} ln(1/p_n)/ln(n) = 1

# Output the components of the final calculation.
