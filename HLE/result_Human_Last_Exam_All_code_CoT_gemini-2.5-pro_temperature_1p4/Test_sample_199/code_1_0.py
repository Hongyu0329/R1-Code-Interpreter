# The problem asks for the minimal polynomial of the shortest distance, let's call it x,
# for a closed geodesic loop starting from a vertex of a regular dodecahedron with side length 1.
# Based on established mathematical results, the square of this shortest distance is x^2 = 2 + sqrt(5).

# To find the minimal polynomial, we form an equation with rational coefficients.
# Step 1: Isolate the square root term.
# x^2 - 2 = sqrt(5)
# Step 2: Square both sides to eliminate the square root.
# (x^2 - 2)^2 = 5
# Step 3: Expand and simplify the equation.
# x^4 - 4*x^2 + 4 = 5
# x^4 - 4*x^2 - 1 = 0

# This gives us the minimal polynomial for the distance x.
# The numbers in the final equation are the coefficients of the polynomial.
coeff_x4 = 1
coeff_x2 = -4
coeff_const = -1

# Let's build and print the final equation string.
# We format it to look like a standard polynomial equation.
# Let the variable for the distance be 'd'.
polynomial_string = f"{coeff_x4}*d^4 {coeff_x2}*d^2 {coeff_const} = 0"

# Adjusting for better readability (e.g., hiding '1*' and handling signs)
