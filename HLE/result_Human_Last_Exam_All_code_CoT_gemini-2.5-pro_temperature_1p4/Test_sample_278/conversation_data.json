    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Parametric Curve:** The curve is defined by `x = cos(t)` and `y = b * sin(t)`. The value of `b` depends on the interval of `t`.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `b = 1`. This section is `x = cos(t), y = sin(t)`, which is the upper semi-unit circle (`y ≥ 0`).\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `b = 5`. This section is `x = cos(t), y = 5sin(t)`, which is the lower half of an ellipse (`y < 0`).\n\n2.  **Find the Bounding Box:** To find the smallest enclosing square, we first need to find the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` values that the curve reaches. This defines a bounding rectangle.\n    *   **X-coordinates:** `x = cos(t)` for `t` in `[0, 2π)`. The maximum value of `cos(t)` is 1 and the minimum is -1. So, `x_max = 1` and `x_min = -1`. The width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   **Y-coordinates:**\n        *   In the first interval `[0, π]`, `y = sin(t)`. The maximum value is `sin(π/2) = 1` and the minimum is `sin(0) = sin(π) = 0`.\n        *   In the second interval `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5sin(t)`. Since `sin(t)` is negative here, the minimum value is `5 * sin(3π/2) = 5 * (-1) = -5`.\n        *   Combining both intervals, the overall maximum `y` is 1 and the minimum is -5. So, `y_max = 1` and `y_min = -5`. The height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Enclosing Square:** The figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n    *   Side of the square = `max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area:** The area of this square is the side length squared.\n    *   Area = `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the area of the smallest square enclosing a parametric curve.\n# We first need to find the extent of the curve in x and y directions.\n\n# x = cos(t) for t in [0, 2*pi). The range of cos(t) is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# y is defined in two parts.\n# For t in [0, pi], y = 1 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is [0, 1].\ny_max_part1 = 1\n# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is (-1, 0].\n# So the range of 5*sin(t) is (-5, 0].\ny_min_part2 = -5\n\n# The total range for y is the union of the ranges from the two parts.\ny_min = y_min_part2\ny_max = y_max_part1\n\n# Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle for the figure.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\nprint(f\"The figure's maximum width is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The figure's maximum height is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n\n# The side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_of_square = max(width, height)\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the larger dimension: {side_of_square}.\")\n\n# Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_of_square ** 2\nprint(\"The area of the square is found by squaring its side length.\")\nprint(f\"Final calculation: {int(side_of_square)} * {int(side_of_square)} = {int(area)}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
