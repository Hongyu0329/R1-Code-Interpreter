    This function determines and prints the optimal feedback adjustment factor 'b'.

    The objective is to maximize the mutual information of a channel with correlated noise.
    The noise vector (Z₁, Z₂) has a covariance matrix with off-diagonal element α.
    A feedback mechanism allows adjusting the second transmission X₂ based on the
    first noise component Z₁. The adjustment is X₂ = U₂ + bZ₁, where U₂ is new information.

    The optimal strategy is to use the feedback to cancel the part of the noise Z₂
    that can be predicted from Z₁. For a bivariate normal distribution, the
    predictable part of Z₂ is E[Z₂|Z₁] = αZ₁.

    To cancel this, the feedback term bZ₁ should be set to its negative:
    bZ₁ = -αZ₁
    This leads to the simple and intuitive result b = -α.
