    For the 2-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a periodic domain (like the torus T^2), it is a well-established mathematical theorem that for any smooth, divergence-free initial data u_0, a unique smooth solution u(t,x) exists for all positive time (t >= 0).

    This result is known as 'global well-posedness'. Because the solution is guaranteed to exist and remain smooth for all time, it cannot 'blow up' (i.e., its derivatives cannot become infinite) in a finite amount of time.

    This classical result was established by mathematicians like Jean Leray and Olga Ladyzhenskaya. The situation is dramatically different in 3 dimensions, where the same question remains one of the seven unsolved Millennium Prize Problems. In 3D, it is unknown whether solutions starting from smooth initial data can develop singularities in finite time.
