    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Determine the degree of the extension.**\n    Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 4, with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ to $K$, where $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in K$.\n    The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. The degree $[L:K]$ is 2 if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, and 1 otherwise. We will verify it is not a square, which implies $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n2.  **Establish that the extension is Galois.**\n    For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be a splitting field. This can be verified by showing that for any automorphism $\\tau \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the element $\\sqrt{\\tau(\\beta)}$ is contained in $L$. We will show this is true.\n\n3.  **Determine the group structure.**\n    A group of order 8 can be one of five types: $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, the dihedral group $D_4$, or the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n    By checking for commutativity and counting the number of elements of each order, we can identify the group.\n    - We know the group is non-abelian, which rules out the first three options.\n    - The quaternion group $Q_8$ has one element of order 2, while the dihedral group $D_4$ has five. We will count the elements of order 2 in our Galois group.\n\n4.  **Use Python for verification.**\n    The algebraic manipulations can be complex. I will use a Python script to perform the key calculations in the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ to verify the crucial steps of the argument. This includes checking if certain elements are squares and calculating products of automorphisms' actions on elements, which will help us count the elements of order 2.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the plan.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nimport math\n\nclass QuadField:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class to represent elements of the field K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n    An element is of the form a + b*sqrt(2) + c*sqrt(3) + d*sqrt(6).\n    Coefficients a, b, c, d are stored as Fraction objects for precision.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, a, b=0, c=0, d=0):\n        self.coeffs = [Fraction(x) for x in [a, b, c, d]]\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        a, b, c, d = self.coeffs\n        terms = []\n        if a: terms.append(f\"{a}\")\n        if b: terms.append(f\"{b}*sqrt(2)\")\n        if c: terms.append(f\"{c}*sqrt(3)\")\n        if d: terms.append(f\"{d}*sqrt(6)\")\n        if not terms: return \"0\"\n        return \" + \".join(terms).replace(\" + -\", \" - \")\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.coeffs == other.coeffs\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        a1, b1, c1, d1 = self.coeffs\n        a2, b2, c2, d2 = other.coeffs\n        # (a1+b1*s2+c1*s3+d1*s6)(a2+b2*s2+c2*s3+d2*s6)\n        a_new = a1*a2 + 2*b1*b2 + 3*c1*c2 + 6*d1*d2\n        b_new = a1*b2 + b1*a2 + 3*c1*d2 + 3*d1*c2\n        c_new = a1*c2 + c1*a2 + 2*b1*d2 + 2*d1*b2\n        d_new = a1*d2 + d1*a2 + b1*c2 + c1*b2\n        return QuadField(a_new, b_new, c_new, d_new)\n\n    def inv(self):\n        \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a field element.\"\"\"\n        a, b, c, d = self.coeffs\n        # Denominator of the inverse for a+b*sqrt(2)+c*sqrt(3)+d*sqrt(6)\n        # Found by expanding (a+b*s2+c*s3+d*s6)*(a-b*s2-c*s3+d*s6)*(a+b*s2-c*s3-d*s6)*(a-b*s2+c*s3-d*s6)\n        # This is quite complicated.
