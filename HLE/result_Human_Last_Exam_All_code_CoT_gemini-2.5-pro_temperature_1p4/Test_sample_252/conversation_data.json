    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary, we need to understand the principle of computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to reconstruct a 3D data cube, which contains two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ), from a single 2D image sensor.\n2.  **Recall Tomography Principles:** Computed tomography works by acquiring multiple projection \"views\" of an object from different angles and then computationally reconstructing the object's internal structure. In CTIS, the different \"views\" are the multiple, spectrally dispersed images of the scene projected onto the sensor.\n3.  **Role of a Diffraction Grating:** A single one-dimensional (1D) diffraction grating disperses light along one axis. This would create a set of spectral projections (diffraction orders), but they would all be aligned along a single line. This is analogous to having all your CT scanner views in a single plane, which is not enough information to reconstruct a 2D slice, let alone a 3D volume.\n4.  **Achieving Full Reconstruction:** To uniquely solve for the (x, y, λ) data cube, the projections must have sufficient angular diversity. This requires dispersing the light in two dimensions (e.g., along both the horizontal and vertical axes of the sensor).\n5.  **Calculate the Requirement:** Dispersing light along two independent axes requires the functional equivalent of two 1D gratings, typically arranged as a single \"crossed grating.\" Therefore, the minimum number of gratings (conceptually) is 2.\n6.  **Code Representation:** I will write a simple Python script to represent this logic by defining the number of dispersion axes required for the reconstruction and the number of axes provided by a single grating.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_gratings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for single-shot\n    computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n    In CTIS, a 3D data cube (x, y, lambda) is reconstructed from a 2D sensor image.\n    This tomographic reconstruction requires projections with angular diversity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # For a full tomographic reconstruction of a 2D spatial scene, we need\n    # to create projections that are dispersed along two independent axes.\n    required_dispersion_axes = 2\n\n    # A single, standard diffraction grating provides dispersion along only one axis.\n    axes_per_grating = 1\n\n    # The minimum number of gratings is the total required axes divided by the\n    # number of axes each grating provides.\n    min_gratings = required_dispersion_axes // axes_per_grating\n\n    print(\"--- CTIS Grating Requirement Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"To reconstruct a spectral volume from a single 2D image, projections must be dispersed across a 2D plane.\")\n    print(f\"Number of independent dispersion axes required: {required_dispersion_axes}\")\n    print(f\"Number of dispersion axes provided by a single standard grating: {axes_per_grating}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {required_dispersion_axes} (required axes) / {axes_per_grating} (axes per grating) = {min_gratings} gratings\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is {min_gratings}.\")\n\ncalculate_minimum_gratings()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
