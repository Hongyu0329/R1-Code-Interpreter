    "My plan is to first convert the Roman numerals in the equation into modern numbers.\n1.  `XLIX` is 49 (L=50, X=10, I=1; XL is 50-10=40, IX is 10-1=9, so 40+9=49).\n2.  `CCC` is 300 (C=100; 100+100+100=300).\n3.  `CCXI` is 211 (C=100, X=10, I=1; 100+100+10+1=211).\n\nThe equation becomes: 49 / 300 - 211.\nI will write a Python script to calculate this and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The equation is XLIX / CCC - CCXI = ?\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to modern numbers\nnum1 = 49  # XLIX\nnum2 = 300  # CCC\nnum3 = 211  # CCXI\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers\nprint(f\"Equation: {num1} / {num2} - {num3}\")\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"Result: {result}\")\n```\n<<<-210.83666666666667>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
