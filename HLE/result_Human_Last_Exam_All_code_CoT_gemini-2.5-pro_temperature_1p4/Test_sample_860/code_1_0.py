# The user wants me to identify the correct medical procedure from the given options.
# The patient is in hemorrhagic shock due to trauma.
# The primary goal is to restore circulating volume.

# Option A is incorrect because CPR is not indicated as the patient has a pulse.
# Option B is incorrect because anticoagulants would worsen the active bleeding.
# Option D is a correct fluid, but option C is more comprehensive.
# Option E is incorrect as adding fructose is not the primary goal and can be detrimental.
# Option C is the most appropriate first-line treatment. It involves rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloids (Normal Saline or Ringer's Lactate) to expand intravascular volume and stabilize the patient while preparing for blood transfusion.

correct_answer = 'C'
explanation = "The patient is in severe hemorrhagic shock. The immediate priority is rapid volume resuscitation to restore blood pressure and organ perfusion. This is achieved with intravenous infusion of isotonic crystalloids, such as normal saline or Ringer's lactate. While blood transfusion is the definitive treatment to replace lost red blood cells, fluid resuscitation is the critical first step in an emergency."

# The user wants a Python script. I will print the thinking process and the final answer.
# However, this task is not a calculation problem, so there is no equation to print.
# I will just print the final answer choice.

# I will print the letter of the correct answer.
print("The correct answer choice is C.")
