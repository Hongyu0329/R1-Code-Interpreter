    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$, we will first identify the properties of this graph and then apply the specific formula for its Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Graph Properties:** The graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of $n=1000$ vertices each. This graph is $n$-regular, meaning every vertex has a degree of $1000$.\n2.  **Define the Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    *   The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$ (i.e., $d_D^+(v) < k$).\n    *   The number of even Eulerian subgraphs, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs, $EO(D)$.\n3.  **Derive the Formula:** For a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where $n$ is an even number (as is the case here with $n=1000$), there is a precise formula for the Alon-Tarsi number: $AT(K_{n,n}) = n/2 + 2$. We can show this with the following argument:\n    *   **Lower Bound ($AT(G) > n/2 + 1$):** Assume $AT(G) \\le n/2 + 1$. This implies there's an orientation $D$ with $d_D^+(v) \\le n/2$ for all vertices and $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$. The sum of all out-degrees in $D$ must equal the total number of edges, which is $n^2$. With $2n$ vertices, if each $d_D^+(v) \\le n/2$, the total sum of out-degrees is at most $2n \\times (n/2) = n^2$. To achieve exactly $n^2$, every vertex must have an out-degree of precisely $n/2$. Such an orientation is called Eulerian. However, for any Eulerian orientation, it is a known theorem that $EE(D) = EO(D)$, which creates a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption was wrong, and $AT(G) > n/2 + 1$.\n    *   **Upper Bound ($AT(G) \\le n/2 + 2$):** Since $G$ is $n$-regular with $n$ being even, it is known to have an Eulerian orientation $D_0$, where $d_{D_0}^+(v) = n/2$ for all vertices. For $D_0$, we have $EE(D_0) = EO(D_0)$. We can construct a new orientation $D'$ by reversing a single edge in $D_0$. In $D'$, the maximum out-degree becomes $n/2 + 1$. For such an orientation $D'$, it's a known result that $EE(D') \\ne EO(D')$. Thus, we have an orientation $D'$ where all out-degrees are $d_{D'}^+(v) \\le n/2+1 < n/2+2$, and the non-equal Eulerian subgraph count condition is met. This demonstrates that $k=n/2+2$ works, so $AT(G) \\le n/2 + 2$.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** Combining the bounds, we have $n/2 + 1 < AT(G) \\le n/2 + 2$. Since the Alon-Tarsi number is an integer, we must have $AT(K_{n,n}) = n/2 + 2$. The following python script will perform this calculation for $n=1000$.\n\n```python\n# Set the parameter n for the graph K_n,n\nn = 1000\n\n# For a complete bipartite graph K_n,n where n is even,\n# the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula: AT(K_n,n) = n/2 + 2.\n\n# Perform the calculation based on the formula.\n# First, divide n by 2.\nhalf_n = n / 2\n# Then, add 2 to the result.\nresult = half_n + 2\n\n# Print the explanation of the calculation.\nprint(f\"The Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n},{n} for an even n is calculated using the formula n/2 + 2.\")\nprint(\"The calculation steps are:\")\nprint(f\"1.

Add 2 to the result: {int(half_n)} + 2 = {int(result)}\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {n} / 2 + 2 = {int(result)}\")\nprint(f\"The Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n},{n} is {int(result)}.\")\n```\n<<<502>>>"
