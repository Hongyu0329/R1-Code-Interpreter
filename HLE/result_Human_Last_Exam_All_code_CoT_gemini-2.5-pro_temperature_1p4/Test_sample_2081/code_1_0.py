    """
    This function calculates the radius R of the sphere of initial conditions 
    (x0, y0, z0) for which the given nonlinear boundary-value problem has a solution.

    The solvability condition is derived to be:
    (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2) * (1 - exp(-T)) = alpha

    Let R^2 = x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2. Then the equation for R is:
    R^2 = alpha / (1 - exp(-T))

    Substituting T = ln(10^34) and alpha = 0.5 * (exp(2T) - 1), we get:
    R^2 = (0.5 * (exp(2T) - 1)) / (1 - exp(-T))
    R^2 = (0.5 * (exp(T)^2 - 1)) / (1 - 1/exp(T))
