    Solves the problem by providing the final answer string.
    A) N: For any H-free graph, we can find a larger H-free graph.
    B) D: Depends on whether the finite set is empty or not.
    C) D: The set of natural numbers has no max, the set of negative integers has a max.
    D) Y: The class of uncountable discrete subsets of R is empty, so the statement is vacuously true.
    E) Y: The relation is 'b is a subsequence of a'. Constant sequences are maximal.
    F) N: The relation is 'a is a subsequence of b'. For any sequence m, we can construct a sequence x that properly contains m as a subsequence.
