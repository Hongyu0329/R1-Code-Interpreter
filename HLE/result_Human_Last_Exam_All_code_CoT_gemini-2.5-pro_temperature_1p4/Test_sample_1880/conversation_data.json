    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for quartics.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we'll determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial's Galois group acts transitively on its roots, which restricts the possible group structures. We will use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant of the polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field ($\\mathbb{Q}$).\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We will construct and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with our quartic. Whether this cubic is reducible or irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides the final piece of information needed to distinguish between the remaining possible Galois groups.\n4.  **Synthesize the Results:** By combining the information from the previous steps, we can uniquely identify the Galois group and thus determine its order.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations step-by-step and print out the reasoning for each stage.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + px + q.\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    \n    print(\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the order of its Galois group over Q.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility.\")\n    print(\"We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\"- The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 2.\")\n    print(\"- The other coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) are all divisible by 2.\")\n    print(\"- The constant term 14 is not divisible by p^2 = 4.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"This means the Galois group G is a transitive subgroup of S_4.
