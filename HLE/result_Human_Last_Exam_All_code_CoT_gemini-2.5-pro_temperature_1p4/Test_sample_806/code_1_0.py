    explanation = """
The clinical presentation described, involving an anticonvulsant medication followed by the development of skin blisters, strongly suggests a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) like Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).

The specific biochemical reaction that INITIATES this process is:

The non-covalent binding of the causative drug molecule (or its metabolite) to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein, which is part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I system.

Here is a breakdown of the process:

1. INITIATION: The drug molecule physically interacts with and binds directly to a specific groove within an HLA protein on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. This binding is highly specific to certain drugs and certain HLA alleles (e.g., carbamazepine and HLA-B*15:02).

2. IMMUNE RECOGNITION: This new drug-HLA complex is recognized as a foreign danger signal by the T-cell receptors on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (killer T-cells).

3. ACTIVATION & ATTACK: This recognition triggers a massive activation and clonal expansion of these specific T-cells. These cells then migrate to the skin and mucous membranes, where they release cytotoxic proteins (such as granulysin, perforin, and granzymes).

4. CELL DEATH & BLISTERING: These proteins induce widespread apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the skin's keratinocytes. This mass cell death causes the epidermis to detach from the underlying dermis, resulting in the formation of the blisters and skin sloughing characteristic of SJS/TEN.

Therefore, the initial, pivotal biochemical event is the drug-HLA binding, which sets off the entire catastrophic immune cascade.
