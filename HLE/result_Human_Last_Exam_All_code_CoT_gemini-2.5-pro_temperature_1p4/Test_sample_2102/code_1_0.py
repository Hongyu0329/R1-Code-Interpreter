    Solves the problem by following these steps:
    1. Define the function g(x) and compute its Taylor series coefficients c_k.
    2. Model the Schur matrix S_n as an upper-triangular Toeplitz matrix with the first row being (c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}).
    3. Determine that the eigenvalues of S_n are all c_0.
    4. Calculate c_0 and use the condition f(n) > 10 to find the smallest integer n.
    5. For this n, determine the structure of the Weyr matrix W_n by analyzing the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue, which depends on c_1.
    6. Calculate the infinity norm of W_n.
    7. Compute the final product n * ||W_n||_inf.

    # S_n - c0*I is an upper triangular Toeplitz matrix with 0 on the diagonal and (0, c1, c2, ...) as the first row.
