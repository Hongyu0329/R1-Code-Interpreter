    # The planar set is a collection of a circle, line segments, and a circular arc.
    # To find the number of points whose removal disconnects the set into 3 or more
    # components, we need to find the special "junction" points and analyze them.

    # A point 'p' whose removal creates N components is called a cut point or articulation point.
    # The number of components created by removing a point 'p' is related to how many
    # "dead-end" branches originate from 'p'. A dead-end branch is a path from 'p'
    # that does not connect back to the main figure anywhere else.

    # Removing (0, 1) splits L1 into two branches. The endpoints (0, 1/2) and (0, 3/2) are "free".
