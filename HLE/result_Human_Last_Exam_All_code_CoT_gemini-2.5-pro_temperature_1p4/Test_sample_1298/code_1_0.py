# The patient presents with clear signs of metastatic melanoma leading to a life-threatening
# complication (cardiac tamponade from a malignant pericardial effusion).
# The pericardiocentesis confirmed the presence of malignant cells.
# While the immediate tamponade has been relieved by draining the fluid, the underlying
# cause—widespread cancer—must be addressed to prevent recurrence and treat the disease systemically.

# A. Prescribe meloxicam: Inadequate. Manages symptoms, not the underlying cancer.
# B. Prescribe low-dose analgesia: Inadequate. Manages pain, not the underlying cancer.
# C. None of the choices: Incorrect, as there is a correct option.
# D. Chemotherapy to kill the malignant cells: Correct. This is a systemic therapy that targets
#    the cancer throughout the body, which is necessary for metastatic disease.
# E. Immunosuppression: Incorrect and harmful. Melanoma treatment often involves immunotherapy
#    to boost the immune system.
# F. Rapid antibiotic infusion: Incorrect. There are no signs of a bacterial infection.
# G. Radiotherapy: Incorrect as a primary treatment. It's a local therapy and cannot address widespread disease.
# H. Diuretics: Inadequate and potentially harmful. Does not address the cancer and can worsen hemodynamics in tamponade.

# The most appropriate next step is systemic therapy to treat the metastatic cancer.
# Chemotherapy is the choice that represents this action.

correct_choice = 'D'
print(f"The patient has widespread metastatic disease confirmed by malignant cells in the pericardial fluid. The most crucial next step is to start systemic treatment to control the cancer throughout the body. Therefore, the answer is Chemotherapy.")
