    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem involving directed ortho-metalation followed by an electrophilic quench. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has a benzene ring with two key functional groups: a diethylamide (`-CON(CH₂CH₃)₂`) and a dimethylamino (`-N(CH₃)₂`) group, which are `meta` to each other.\n    *   **Reagents (Step 1):** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine). This combination is a powerful base system specifically used for a reaction called Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM). It selectively removes a proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to a suitable directing group on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Reagent (Step 2):** Methyl iodide (CH₃I). This is a simple electrophile that provides a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Metalation (Step 1):**\n    *   Both the amide and the amino groups are strong *directing groups* for this reaction. They coordinate the lithium ion, directing the base to remove a nearby proton.\n    *   The amide group is at position 1, and the dimethylamino group is at position 3.\n    *   The amide group directs metalation to positions 2 and 6.\n    *   The dimethylamino group directs metalation to positions 2 and 4.\n    *   The C-H bond at position 2 is *ortho* to both directing groups. This synergistic effect makes the proton at position 2 exceptionally acidic and the clear site for deprotonation by sec-BuLi. An aryllithium intermediate is formed with lithium at position 2.\n\n3.  **Determine the Result of the Electrophilic Quench (Step 2):**\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate formed in step 1 is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   It will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion.\n    *   This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching a methyl group to position 2 of the benzene ring.\n\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, a methyl group is added to the C2 position.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents on the ring are alphabetized (`dimethylamino` before `methyl`).\n    *   The resulting compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this analysis and prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a two-step chemical reaction and identifies the final product.\n    The reaction is the directed ortho-metalation of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    followed by methylation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the reaction\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    reagents_step1 = \"sec-BuLi and TMEDA\"\n    reagents_step2 = \"methyl iodide (CH3I)\"\n\n    # Explanation of the chemical logic\n    # Step 1: Directed ortho-metalation (DoM).\n    # The starting material has two directing groups on its benzene ring:\n    # - An amide group at position 1.\n    # - A dimethylamino group at position 3.\n    # The C-H bond at position 2 is ortho to both groups, leading to selective\n    # deprotonation at this site by the strong base (sec-BuLi/TMEDA).\n    # This forms an aryllithium intermediate.\n    \n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Quench.\n    # The nucleophilic aryllithium attacks the electrophile, methyl iodide.\n    # A methyl group is added to the ring at position 2.\n    \n    # Construct the final product name based on IUPAC rules.\n    # Ring substituents are alphabetized ('dimethylamino' before 'methyl').\n    # The numbers correspond to their positions on the ring.\n    product_name = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide\"\n    \n    # Print the reaction summary, which serves as the \"equation\"\n    print(\"--- Chemical Reaction Summary ---\")\n    print(f\"Reactant: {starting_material}\")\n    print(f\"Reaction Steps:\")\n    print(f\"  1.
