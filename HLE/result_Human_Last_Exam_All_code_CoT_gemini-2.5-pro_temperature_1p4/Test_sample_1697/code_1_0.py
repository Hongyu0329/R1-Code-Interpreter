    # Explanation of the chemical logic
    # Step 1: Directed ortho-metalation (DoM).
    # The starting material has two directing groups on its benzene ring:
    # - An amide group at position 1.
    # - A dimethylamino group at position 3.
    # The C-H bond at position 2 is ortho to both groups, leading to selective
    # deprotonation at this site by the strong base (sec-BuLi/TMEDA).
    # This forms an aryllithium intermediate.
    
    # Step 2: Electrophilic Quench.
    # The nucleophilic aryllithium attacks the electrophile, methyl iodide.
    # A methyl group is added to the ring at position 2.
    
    # Construct the final product name based on IUPAC rules.
    # Ring substituents are alphabetized ('dimethylamino' before 'methyl').
    # The numbers correspond to their positions on the ring.
