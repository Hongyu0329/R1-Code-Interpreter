    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule:** The starting material is di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, which has a structure of Perylene-S-S-Perylene. The major reduction product is formed by breaking the S-S bond and adding a hydrogen atom to each sulfur, resulting in two molecules of perylene-3-thiol (Perylene-SH). The question asks for the indices of this reduction product.\n\n2.  **Represent as a Graph:** I will model the perylene-3-thiol molecule as a graph where each atom (carbon, sulfur, and hydrogen) is a node, and each chemical bond is an edge. Perylene has 20 carbon and 12 hydrogen atoms (C20H12). Perylene-3-thiol (C20H11SH) has a total of 20 carbons, 1 sulfur, and 12 hydrogens, for a total of 33 atoms (nodes).\n\n3.  **Construct the Graph:** To ensure accuracy, I will use the `networkx` library to create the graph. I'll start with the standard carbon skeleton of perylene, which `networkx` can generate. Then, I'll identify the 12 carbons that bond to hydrogen atoms (those with a degree of 2 in the skeleton). I will substitute one of these with a thiol group (-SH) and attach hydrogens to the other 11.\n\n4.  **Calculate Wiener Index (W):** The Wiener index is the sum of the shortest path distances between all unordered pairs of nodes in the graph. I will use `networkx`'s all-pairs shortest path algorithm to compute this.\n\n5.  **Calculate Szeged Index (Sz):** The Szeged index is calculated by summing contributions from each edge. For an edge `e=(u, v)`, its contribution is `n_u(e) * n_v(e)`, where `n_u(e)` is the number of nodes closer to `u` than to `v`, and `n_v(e)` is the number of nodes closer to `v` than to `u`. I will implement this by iterating through each edge and running a distance calculation from its two endpoints.\n\n6.  **Compute the Ratio:** Finally, I will compute the ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index (Sz/W) and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef calculate_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the Wiener and Szeged indices, and their ratio,\n    for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, which is perylene-3-thiol.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Create the carbon skeleton of perylene using the built-in generator.\n    # This creates a graph with 20 nodes representing the carbon atoms.\n    G = nx.perylenegraph()\n\n    # Step 2: Add hydrogens and the thiol group (-SH) to the skeleton.\n    # In the perylene skeleton, carbons that bind to hydrogens have a degree of 2.\n    # Perylene (C20H12) has 12 such carbons.\n    degree_2_carbons = [node for node, degree in G.degree() if degree == 2]\n\n    # Define indices for the new atoms to be added.\n    # Carbons are 0-19.
