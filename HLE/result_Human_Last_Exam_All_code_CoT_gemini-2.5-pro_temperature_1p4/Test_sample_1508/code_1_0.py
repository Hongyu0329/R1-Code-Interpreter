    This function addresses question (a) by constructing a counterexample
    and verifying it using symbolic mathematics.

    Question (a): Is it true that if s > floor(n/2), the polynomials {P_i(x)}
    can always be made linearly dependent?

    We will test this for n=4, s=3. Here s=3 > floor(4/2)=2, so the condition holds.
    Let L = {0, 1, 2}.
    Let F be the family of all 3-element subsets of [4].
    F = {{1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}}.
    This family is L-intersecting because the intersection of any two distinct sets
    has size 2, which is in L.
    Let's make it an ordered family. Let n=4.
    Let F_1={1,2,4}, F_2={1,3,4}, F_3={2,3,4}. These contain n=4. (r=3)
    Let F_4={1,2,3}. This does not contain n=4.
    The sizes are all 3, so the size-ordering condition |F_i| <= |F_j| for i < j holds.
    This is an ordered L-intersecting family for n=4, s=3.

    The polynomials are P_i(x) = product_{l_k < |F_i|} (<x,v_i> - l_k).
    Since |F_i|=3 for all i, and L={0,1,2}, the product is over all l_k in L.
    P_i(x) = (<x,v_i> - 0) * (<x,v_i> - 1) * (<x,v_i> - 2).

    We will now check if P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4 are linearly independent.
