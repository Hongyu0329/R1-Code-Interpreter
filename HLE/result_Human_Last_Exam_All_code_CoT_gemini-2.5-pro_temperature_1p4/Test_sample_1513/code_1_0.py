# The user wants to identify a specific island town based on a set of clues.

# Clue 1: More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.
# This points to a highly remote location. Easter Island fits this, as it's over 2,000 km
# from the inhabited Pitcairn Islands.

# Clue 2 & 3: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.
# Easter Island is a volcanic island. The town of Hanga Roa is situated in a low-lying
# area between the slopes of the Terevaka and Rano Kau volcanoes. While not a
# simple, circular caldera itself, the bay's geography is a direct result of the
# island's massive volcanic structures and their calderas.

# Clue 4: The town and the bay share the same name.
# The town is named Hanga Roa, and it is located on Hanga Roa Bay.

# Therefore, the town that fits all the criteria is Hanga Roa.

answer = "Hanga Roa"
