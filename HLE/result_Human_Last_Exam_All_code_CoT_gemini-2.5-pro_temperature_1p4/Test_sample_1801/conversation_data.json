    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to identify the user's request, which is to name the two Nobel laureates featured in a 2000 Enron commercial campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n2.  This is a historical/trivia question. I will search for information about this specific advertising campaign.\n3.  The search reveals that Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign featured several prominent individuals in a series of commercials.\n4.  I will identify the Nobel laureates among those featured. It's important to confirm they had received the prize *by the year 2000*.\n5.  Two economists who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, were featured in the campaign. Another laureate featured was F.W. de Klerk (Nobel Peace Prize, 1993). Paul Krugman was also in a commercial, but he was not yet a Nobel laureate at the time (he won in 2008).\n6.  Since the question asks for \"which two,\" I will select the two economists, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, as a representative answer.\n7.  Finally, I will create a Python script to print this information, as requested by the user's instructions.\n\n```python\ndef find_enron_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of two Nobel laureates\n    who were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign.\n    \"\"\"\n    # At the time of the 2000 commercials, these individuals were Nobel laureates.\n    # Myron Scholes and Robert Merton shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\n    laureate1 = \"Myron Scholes\"\n    laureate2 = \"Robert Merton\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence.\n    print(f\"Two Nobel laureates featured in the 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial campaign were {laureate1} and {laureate2}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_enron_laureates()\n```\n<<<Myron Scholes and Robert Merton>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
