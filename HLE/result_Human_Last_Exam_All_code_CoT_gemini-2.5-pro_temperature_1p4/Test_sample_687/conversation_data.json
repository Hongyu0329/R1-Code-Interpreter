    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the $9_{23}$ knot, we can use an inequality derived from its HOMFLY polynomial, $P(K)(a, z)$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **State the relevant theorem:** The span of the HOMFLY polynomial in the variable $z$, denoted $\\text{span}_z(P)$, provides a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles, $s(K)$, via the inequality:\n    $s(K) \\ge \\frac{\\text{span}_z(P)}{2} + 1$\n    where $\\text{span}_z(P)$ is the difference between the highest and lowest powers of $z$ in the polynomial.\n\n2.  **Compute the HOMFLY polynomial:** We will use the `spherogram` Python library, a standard tool in computational knot theory, to calculate the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$. While different conventions for the HOMFLY polynomial exist, the span of the second variable (often denoted $z$ or $M$) is an invariant that can be used in the formula.\n\n3.  **Calculate the span:** From the computed polynomial, we will identify the minimum and maximum powers of the second variable.\n\n4.  **Apply the formula:** We will substitute the calculated span into the inequality to find the integer lower bound for $s(9_{23})$.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\n# The solution requires the 'spherogram' and 'sympy' libraries.\n# You can install them using pip:\n# pip install spherogram\n# pip install sympy\n\nimport spherogram\nimport sympy\n\n# --- Introduction ---\nprint(\"This script calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles, s(K), for the 9_23 knot.\")\nprint(\"We use the inequality derived from the HOMFLY polynomial P(a,z): s(K) >= span_z(P)/2 + 1.\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 1: Get the knot and its HOMFLY polynomial ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Compute the HOMFLY polynomial for the 9_23 knot.\")\ntry:\n    # In spherogram, knots are identified by their Alexander-Briggs notation, e.g., (9, 23) for 9_23.\n    knot = spherogram.Knot(9, 23)\n\n    # Compute the HOMFLY polynomial.
