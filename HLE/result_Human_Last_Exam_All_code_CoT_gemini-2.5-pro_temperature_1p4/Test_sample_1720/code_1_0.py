    This function analyzes the clinical scenario to determine the best course of treatment.

    The patient presents with septic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea) secondary to widespread necrotizing infection.
    The core principles of managing this life-threatening condition are:
    1. Early resuscitation (e.g., intravenous fluids to correct shock and dehydration).
    2. Early administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics.
    3. Urgent surgical debridement for source control (removing the dead, infected tissue).

    Let's evaluate the options:
    A. Intravenous fluid: Essential for resuscitation, but insufficient alone.
    B. Intravenous medication: Essential for treating systemic infection, but insufficient while the necrotic source remains.
    C. Surgical debridement: Essential for source control, but the patient needs medical stabilization and systemic antibiotics.
    D. Chemical debridement: Too slow and ineffective for this severe case.
    E. High-flow O2: Not indicated as SpO2 is normal.
    F. A & B: Correct medical management, but omits the crucial surgical source control. The patient will not improve without it.
    G. B & C: This combines the essential antibiotic therapy with the essential surgical source control. This is the definitive treatment plan for the disease process itself. Fluid resuscitation (A) is understood to be a necessary prerequisite to safely perform the interventions in B & C.
    H. C & E: Omits essential antibiotics and includes an unnecessary oxygen therapy.

    Conclusion: Option G represents the most complete and definitive treatment strategy among the choices.
