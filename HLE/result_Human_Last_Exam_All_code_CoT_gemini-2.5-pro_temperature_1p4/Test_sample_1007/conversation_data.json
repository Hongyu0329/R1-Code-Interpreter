    "To identify the ballet step that ends in the same leg position as it started, we need to analyze the movement of each option. The \"position\" refers to which foot is in front in a closed position like the fifth position.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet term:\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs beat six times in the air. The dancer starts in the fifth position and lands back in the exact same fifth position, with the same foot in front. The position does *not* change.\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word \"échappé\" means to escape, typically from a closed (fifth) to an open (second) position and back. The word \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed\". This indicates that the dancer lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. The position *changes*.\n3.  **C. Assemblé:** This means \"to assemble\". The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air to land in the fifth position. In a standard assemblé (e.g., assemblé dessus), the foot that brushed out lands in front, changing the starting position. The position *changes*.\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:** This means \"to glide behind\". Starting from the fifth position, the back foot glides out and then the front foot closes behind it. This action reverses the feet, so the foot that was in front is now in the back. The position *changes*.\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative jump similar to a pas de chat with added circles of the leg (ronds de jambe). The execution of the step results in the feet switching their front/back placement upon landing. The position *changes*.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the Entrechat six ends in the same position it started from.\n\nI will now write a Python script to model this logic and find the correct answer. The script will use a dictionary to store whether each step changes the foot position and then identify the one that does not.\n\n```python\ndef find_unchanged_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it started.\n\n    The analysis is stored in a dictionary where the key is the step name\n    and the value is a boolean indicating if the feet change position\n    (True = changes, False = remains the same).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data representing whether a step changes the starting foot position.\n    # True: The foot that was in front is now in the back.\n    # False: The foot that was in front is still in front at the end.\n    steps_analysis = {\n        \"A. Entrechat six\": False,\n        \"B. Échappé battu changé\": True,\n        \"C. Assemblé\": True,\n        \"D. Glissade derrière\": True,\n        \"E.
