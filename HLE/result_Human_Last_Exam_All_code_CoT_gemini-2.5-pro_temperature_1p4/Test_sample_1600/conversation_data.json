    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n`, denoted as `a(n)`, is given by the double factorial of `2n-1`. The formula is `a(n) = (2n-1)!!`.\n2.  **Apply for n=3:** We need to find `a(3)`. Plugging `n=3` into the formula gives `a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! = 5!!`.\n3.  **Calculate the Double Factorial:** The double factorial `k!!` is the product of all integers from `k` down to 1 with the same parity as `k`. Since 5 is odd, `5!! = 5 * 3 * 1`.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will iterate from 5 down to 1 with a step of -2, multiplying the numbers. Finally, it will print the complete equation and the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing\n# Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n# The formula is a(n) = (2n-1)!!\n\n# Set the value for n\nn = 3\n\n# Calculate the starting number for the double factorial\nstart_num = 2 * n - 1\n\n# Initialize the result for multiplication\nresult = 1\n# Create a list to store the numbers for the equation string\nfactors = []\n\n# Loop from the starting number down to 1 with a step of -2\nfor i in range(start_num, 0, -2):\n    result *= i\n    factors.append(str(i))\n\n# Create the equation string by joining the factors with \" * \"\nequation_str = \" * \".join(factors)\n\n# Print the final equation showing all the numbers and the result\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
