    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$. I will formulate this as finding the maximum number of real roots of a polynomial and then analyze whether the given constraints on the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ limit this number.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  First, I will establish the nature of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$. Since $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, their composition $f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial.\n2.  I will determine the degree of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The maximum number of real roots of a polynomial is its degree.\n3.  Then, I will investigate if the conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ impose any additional restrictions on the number of real roots.\n4.  This investigation will involve analyzing the derivative, $P'(x)$, to understand how many local extrema $P(x)$ can have. The number of extrema limits the number of roots.\n5.  Finally, I will show that it is plausible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and allow for the maximum possible number of roots, thus answering the question.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this reasoning, printing out the key numbers and logic at each step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fixed_points_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step solution to find the maximum\n    number of fixed points of f(g(x)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the problem and the degree of the polynomial\n    f_degree = 3\n    g_degree = 3\n    print(f\"Let f(x) be a polynomial of degree {f_degree}.\")\n    print(f\"Let g(x) be a polynomial of degree {g_degree}.\")\n\n    h_degree = f_degree * g_degree\n    print(f\"The composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) is a polynomial of degree {f_degree} * {g_degree} = {h_degree}.\")\n\n    print(\"A fixed point is a solution to the equation f(g(x)) = x.\")\n    print(\"This can be written as P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0.\")\n\n    p_degree = h_degree\n    print(f\"The function P(x) is a polynomial of degree {p_degree}.\")\n    print(f\"By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree {p_degree} can have at most {p_degree} real roots.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze the constraints and the derivative\n    print(\"Now, we check if the constraints f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 limit this number.\")\n    print(\"For a polynomial to have the maximum number of distinct real roots, it must 'wiggle' enough.\")\n    print(f\"For P(x) to have {p_degree} real roots, it needs to have {p_degree - 1} local extrema.\")\n    \n    print(\"The local extrema of P(x) are the roots of its derivative, P'(x).\")\n    print(\"P'(x) = d/dx (f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) - 1.\")\n    \n    print(f\"So, for P(x) to have {p_degree - 1} extrema, the equation f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0 must have {p_degree - 1} real roots.\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze the degree of the polynomial H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x).\")\n\n    f_prime_degree = f_degree - 1\n    g_prime_degree = g_degree - 1\n    h_prime_degree = (f_prime_degree * g_degree) + g_prime_degree\n    \n    print(f\"The degree of f'(x) is {f_prime_degree}.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of g'(x) is {g_prime_degree}.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of the polynomial H(x) is ({f_prime_degree} * {g_degree}) + {g_prime_degree} = {h_prime_degree}.\")\n    \n    print(f\"So we are looking for the number of roots of H(x) = 1, where H(x) is a degree {h_prime_degree} polynomial.\")\n    print(f\"A degree {h_prime_degree} polynomial can intersect a horizontal line (y=1) at most {h_prime_degree} times.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 5: Final conclusion\n    print(\"For H(x)=1 to have 8 roots, H(x) must have enough local extrema.\")\n    h_prime_prime_degree = h_prime_degree - 1\n    print(f\"The number of extrema of H(x) is the number of roots of H'(x), which is a polynomial of degree {h_prime_prime_degree}.\")\n    print(f\"A degree {h_prime_prime_degree} polynomial can have up to {h_prime_prime_degree} real roots.\")\n    \n    print(f\"So, it is possible to construct f and g such that H'(x) has {h_prime_prime_degree} real roots, giving H(x) {h_prime_prime_degree} extrema.\")\n    print(\"With enough extrema, it is possible to make H(x) intersect the line y=1 at 8 points.\")\n    \n    print(\"This means P'(x)=0 can have 8 roots, so P(x) can have 8 local extrema.\")\n    print(\"A degree 9 polynomial with 8 local extrema can have 9 real roots.\")\n    print(\"The constant terms in f and g can be adjusted to shift P(x) vertically to ensure all 9 roots are real, without changing the derivative.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the conditions f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 do not prevent the composite function from having the maximum possible number of fixed points.\")\n    \n    max_fixed_points = p_degree\n    print(f\"\\nThe maximum number of fixed points is {max_fixed_points}.\")\n    \n\nsolve_fixed_points_problem()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
