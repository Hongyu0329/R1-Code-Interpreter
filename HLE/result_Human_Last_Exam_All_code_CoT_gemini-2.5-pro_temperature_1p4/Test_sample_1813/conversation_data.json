    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we will follow a standard construction from the theory of Diophantine approximation and the Lagrange and Markov spectra.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Request**: The phrase \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)\" can be ambiguous. The most standard interpretation in this context refers to the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\( \\xi_{p/q} \\), which is constructed directly from the continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\). The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) itself is a value derived from this \\( \\xi_{p/q} \\). We will compute the continued fraction of \\( \\xi_{4/7} \\).\n\n2.  **Construction of \\( \\xi_{p/q} \\)**: The construction rule is as follows:\n    a. First, find the simple continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\). Let's say it is \\( [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] \\). We will assume \\(0 < p/q < 1\\), so \\(a_0 = 0\\).\n    b. Take the sequence of coefficients following the initial zero: \\( (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\).\n    c. Create a new palindromic sequence by concatenating the sequence with its reverse: \\( (a_1, \\ldots, a_n, a_n, \\ldots, a_1) \\).\n    d. The number \\( \\xi_{p/q} \\) is the quadratic irrational whose continued fraction has a purely periodic part given by this new palindromic sequence: \\( \\xi_{p/q} = [0; \\overline{a_1, \\ldots, a_n, a_n, \\ldots, a_1}] \\).\n\n3.  **Execution for \\(p/q = 4/7\\)**:\n    a. Find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).\n    b. Construct the palindromic period for \\( \\xi_{4/7} \\).\n    c. Calculate the value of \\( \\xi_{4/7} \\) by solving the quadratic equation that defines a purely periodic continued fraction.\n    d. Present the final result, showing the continued fraction and its computed value, and list all the numbers that appear in the final equation as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_cf_rational(num, den):\n    \"\"\"Computes the simple continued fraction coefficients for a rational number.\"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    if den == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n    while den != 0:\n        a = num // den\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        num, den = den, num % den\n    return coeffs\n\ndef get_last_two_convergents(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the last two convergents for a sequence of CF coefficients [c_1; c_2, ...].\n    Returns ((p_k, q_k), (p_{k-1}, q_{k-1})).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not coeffs:\n        # Represents an empty CF, which is conventionally 0.\n        # Convergents are p0/q0=0/1, p-1/q-1=1/0\n        return (0, 1), (1, 0)\n    \n    # Initialization for p_k/q_k = [c_1; c_2, ..., c_k]\n    p_km1, q_km1 = 1, 0  # Zeroth convergent p_0/q_0\n    p_k, q_k = coeffs[0], 1  # First convergent p_1/q_1\n    \n    if len(coeffs) == 1:\n        return (p_k, q_k), (p_km1, q_km1)\n        \n    for i in range(1, len(coeffs)):\n        a = coeffs[i]\n        p_next = a * p_k + p_km1\n        q_next = a * q_k + q_km1\n        \n        p_km1, q_km1 = p_k, q_k\n        p_k, q_k = p_next, q_next\n    \n    return (p_k, q_k), (p_km1, q_km1)\n\ndef simplify_sqrt(n):\n    \"\"\"Simplifies sqrt(n) to a * sqrt(b), returning (a, b).\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot take the square root of a negative number.\")\n    i = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    while i > 1:\n        if n % (i * i) == 0:\n            return i, n // (i * i)\n        i -= 1\n    return 1, n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to compute the continued fraction associated with m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q = 4, 7\n\n    # Step 1: Get CF of the rational number\n    cf_rat = get_cf_rational(p, q)\n    a0 = cf_rat[0]\n    seq = cf_rat[1:]\n    \n    print(f\"The continued fraction of {p}/{q} is [{cf_rat[0]}; {', '.join(map(str, cf_rat[1:]))}].\")\n\n    # Step 2: Construct the periodic part for xi\n    period = seq + seq[::-1]\n    period_str = \", \".join(map(str, period))\n    print(f\"The associated periodic part is ({period_str}).\")\n    print(f\"The full continued fraction is [{a0}; {period_str}, ...].\")\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the value of the periodic continued fraction\n    (p_k, q_k), (p_km1, q_km1) = get_last_two_convergents(period)\n    \n    # The value y = [overline(period)] satisfies the equation:\n    # y = (p_k * y + p_km1) / (q_k * y + q_km1)\n    # This leads to the quadratic equation:\n    # q_k * y^2 + (q_km1 - p_k) * y - p_km1 = 0\n    A = q_k\n    B = q_km1 - p_k\n    C = -p_km1\n    \n    # Solve the quadratic equation for y using the quadratic formula.\n    # We take the positive root since the coefficients are positive.\n    # y = (-B + sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n    discriminant = B**2 - 4*A*C\n    \n    # Simplify the radical part of the solution\n    s_coeff, s_root = simplify_sqrt(discriminant)\n\n    # Simplify the expression for y\n    y_num_const = -B\n    y_num_sqrt_coeff = s_coeff\n    y_den = 2*A\n    common_divisor_y = math.gcd(math.gcd(y_num_const, y_num_sqrt_coeff), y_den)\n    y_const = y_num_const // common_divisor_y\n    y_sqrt_coeff = y_num_sqrt_coeff // common_divisor_y\n    y_den = y_den // common_divisor_y\n    \n    # The number we seek is xi = a0 + 1/y.
