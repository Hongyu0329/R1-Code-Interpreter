    "To find the value of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$, we can relate it to a known mathematical identity involving the Gamma function.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  We start with the well-known infinite product expansion for a product of Gamma functions, which gives the value for the product $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$.\n2.  The identity is $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)}$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is a complex cube root of unity.\n3.  The product in the problem starts from $n=3$, not $n=1$. To adjust for this, we must divide the full infinite product by the terms corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n4.  The terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$ are $(1 - z^3/1^3)$ and $(1 - z^3/2^3)$.\n5.  By dividing the identity from step 2 by the terms from step 4 and simplifying, we arrive at the final expression.\n\nThe Python code below carries out this plan and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the formula for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=3 to inf} (1 - z^3/n^3).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the product from n=3 to infinity.\n    # We start with the known identity for the product from n=1.\n    print(\"To solve this, we use a known product identity related to the Gamma function.\")\n    print(\"The infinite product from n=1 is given by:\")\n    print(\"  prod_{n=1 to inf} (1 - z^3/n^3) = 1 / [ Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*w) * Gamma(1-z*w^2) ]\")\n    print(\"  where w = exp(2*pi*i/3) is a complex cube root of unity, and Gamma is the Gamma function.\\n\")\n\n    # The requested product starts from n=3, so we need to divide by the first two terms (n=1, n=2).\n    n1 = 1\n    n2 = 2\n    \n    # The cubes of n1 and n2 appear in the formula. Let's call them out as the \"numbers\" in the equation.\n    term1_denominator = n1**3\n    term2_denominator = n2**3\n\n    print(f\"The product we want starts from n=3. Therefore, we must divide the full product by the terms for n={n1} and n={n2}.\")\n    print(f\"  - The term for n={n1} is: (1 - z^3 / {term1_denominator})\")\n    print(f\"  - The term for n={n2} is: (1 - z^3 / {term2_denominator})\\n\")\n\n    print(\"After dividing the full product by these two terms and simplifying, we get the final expression:\")\n\n    # Constructing the final formula as a string for printing.\n    # The division results in the denominator of the n=2 term's factor (which is 8) moving to the numerator.\n    final_numerator = term2_denominator\n    final_denominator = f\"({term1_denominator} - z^3) * ({term2_denominator} - z^3) * Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*w) * Gamma(1-z*w^2)\"\n\n    # Print the final formula in a visually clear format.\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"          {final_numerator}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"{final_denominator}\\n\")\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<$ \\frac{8}{(1-z^3)(8-z^3)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-ze^{i2\\pi/3})\\Gamma(1-ze^{i4\\pi/3})} $>>>"
