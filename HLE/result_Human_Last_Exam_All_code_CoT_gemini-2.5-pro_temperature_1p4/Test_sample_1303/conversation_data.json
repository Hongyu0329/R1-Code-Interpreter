    "Here is a plan to find the small molecules that interact with the given ChEMBL ID:\n\n1.  **Install Client Library:** First, we need to ensure the necessary Python library `chembl_webresource_client` is installed to communicate with the ChEMBL database.\n2.  **Target Identification:** The user provided the ChEMBL ID `CHEMBL4803817`. We will use this ID to query the ChEMBL database.\n3.  **Query for Activities:** We will search for all recorded bioactivities associated with this target ID. To ensure we find meaningful interactions, we will filter the activities based on the following criteria:\n    *   **Activity Type:** We'll look for 'IC50' values, a common measure of a substance's potency in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function.\n    *   **Potency:** We will filter for molecules with a pChEMBL value greater than or equal to 6. The pChEMBL value is a standardized measure of potency (`-log10(molar IC50, Ki, etc.)`), and a value of 6 or higher corresponds to a potency of 1 micromolar (1000 nM) or better, which is a common threshold for a significant interaction.\n    *   **Assay Confidence:** We'll only consider results from high-confidence assays (confidence score of 9) to ensure the target is correct.\n4.  **Extract and Display Molecule IDs:** From the filtered list of activities, we will extract the ChEMBL IDs of the corresponding small molecules (ligands) and print them for the user.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the ChEMBL web resource client installed.\n# If not, run: pip install chembl_webresource_client\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that interact with a given ChEMBL target ID.\n    \n    Args:\n        target_chembl_id (str): The ChEMBL ID of the target protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        print(f\"Searching for small molecules that interact with target: {target_chembl_id}\")\n        \n        # Initialize the client\n        activity = new_client.activity\n        \n        # Query for activities with high potency (pChEMBL >= 6) and high confidence\n        res = activity.filter(\n            target_chembl_id=target_chembl_id,\n            pchembl_value__gte=6, # pChEMBL >= 6 is equivalent to IC50/Ki <= 1uM\n            assay_type='B', # B for Binding assays\n            confidence_score=9 # High confidence in target-assay mapping\n        ).only('molecule_chembl_id', 'pchembl_value', 'standard_type')\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No interacting small molecules found for {target_chembl_id} with the specified criteria.\")\n            return\n\n        # Convert to a pandas DataFrame for easier handling\n        activities_df = pd.DataFrame(res)\n        \n        # Remove duplicate molecule entries, keeping the one with the highest pChEMBL value\n        activities_df_unique = activities_df.sort_values('pchembl_value', ascending=False).drop_duplicates('molecule_chembl_id')\n        \n        print(f\"\\nFound {len(activities_df_unique)} unique small molecules with significant interaction:\")\n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n        \n        # Print the header for the results table\n        print(f\"{'Molecule ChEMBL ID':<25}{'Interaction pChEMBL':<25}\")\n        print(f\"{'-'*20:<25}{'-'*20:<25}\")\n        \n        # Print each molecule ID and its corresponding pChEMBL value\n        for index, row in activities_df_unique.iterrows():\n            print(f\"{row['molecule_chembl_id']:<25}{row['pchembl_value']:<25}\")\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure the ChEMBL ID is correct and you have an internet connection.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    target_id = \"CHEMBL4803817\"\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_id)\n    # The final answer format is not applicable here as the output is a list of molecules.\n    # Therefore, we will print the final list and add the token at the end.\n    print(\"<<<DONE>>>\")\n\n```"
