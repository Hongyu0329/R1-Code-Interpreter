    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can classify them based on how the 4 morphisms are distributed among the objects. This is a problem of enumerating small categories, which combines combinatorics and basic category theory principles.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Define the basic structure:** A category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have at least two identity morphisms, `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. This leaves us with `4 - 2 = 2` non-identity morphisms to place.\n\n2.  **Partition the morphisms:** We can categorize the possible structures by the number of morphisms in each \"hom-set\": `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(B, B)`, `Hom(A, B)`, and `Hom(B, A)`. Let `n_AA`, `n_BB`, `n_AB`, `n_BA` be the sizes of these sets. We know that `n_AA >= 1`, `n_BB >= 1`, and the total number of morphisms is `n_AA + n_BB + n_AB + n_BA = 4`.\n\n3.  **Enumerate non-isomorphic partitions:** We'll list all possible sets of values for `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)`, considering that swapping `A` and `B` results in an isomorphic category (e.g., signature `(3,1,0,0)` is isomorphic to `(1,3,0,0)`).\n\n4.  **Count categories for each partition:** For each partition (or \"signature\"), we'll determine how many non-isomorphic composition rules can be defined. This often relies on known classifications of small algebraic structures, like monoids (a category with one object is a monoid).\n\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of categories will be the sum of the counts from each non-isomorphic partition.\n\nI will now execute this plan in a Python script that explains each step and calculates the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    The method is a case-by-case analysis based on the distribution of morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Finding the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\\n\")\n    print(\"Let the objects be A and B.
