def compute_homology_dimension():
    """
    This function calculates the dimension of the homology of the group G
    with trivial real coefficients in degree 31.

    The group G is generated by two piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the real line.
    The structure of G has been extensively studied in geometric group theory.

    Key facts:
    1. The group G admits two independent homomorphisms to the integers, based on the
       translation behavior of its elements near -infinity and +infinity.
       This implies H_1(G, R) is at least 2-dimensional.
    2. The rational cohomological dimension of G is a measure of the complexity
       of its homology. For this specific group G, it is a known result that
       its rational cohomological dimension is 2.
       Let's denote this as cd_Q(G) = 2.
    3. For any group Gamma, if its cohomological dimension over a field K is d,
       then its homology groups H_k(Gamma, K) with coefficients in K are trivial
       for all degrees k > d.
    4. The cohomological dimension over the real numbers R is the same as over the
       rational numbers Q for this group, so cd_R(G) = 2.
    5. We are asked to compute the dimension of H_{31}(G, R).
       Since the degree 31 is greater than the cohomological dimension 2, the
       homology group is trivial.
