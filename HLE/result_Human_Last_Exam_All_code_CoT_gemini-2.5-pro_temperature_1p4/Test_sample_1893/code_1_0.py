# In the scenario described, the neutralino mass matrix becomes block-diagonal.
# The four eigenvalues are M_1, -mu, and the two eigenvalues of the submatrix
# mixing the Zino and Higgsino states.
# The problem asks for an eigenvalue that is not dependent on the adjustable
# parameters M_1, M_2, or mu.
# For this to be possible, the parameters must be fine-tuned in such a way
# that one of the eigenvalues simplifies to a physical constant.
# The only relevant constant in the matrix is the Z boson mass, M_Z.
# This implies that one of the eigenvalues must be M_Z.

# The mass of the Z boson in Giga-electron Volts (GeV)
M_Z = 91.1876

# The final equation is that one of the eigenvalues is equal to M_Z.
