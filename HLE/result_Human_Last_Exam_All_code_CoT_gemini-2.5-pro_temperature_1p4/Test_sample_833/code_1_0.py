# The problem is to find the lower bound 'a' for a given mathematical expression
# derived from a nonlocal partial differential equation.
# Through detailed analysis, which involves rewriting the expression using auxiliary
# functions and convolution properties, one arrives at an identity.
# This identity, established in the mathematical literature on this topic, shows
# that the expression is bounded below by -1/8.

# Therefore, the constant 'a' is -1/8.

# Define the components of the constant 'a'.
a_numerator = -1
a_denominator = 8

# Calculate the value of 'a'.
a = a_numerator / a_denominator

# Print the final equation for the lower bound.
print(f"The lower bound is a = {a}")
print(f"The final equation is a = {a_numerator} / {a_denominator}")

# As requested, output the numbers present in the final equation.
print(f"The numbers in the final equation are: {a_numerator}, {a_denominator}")
