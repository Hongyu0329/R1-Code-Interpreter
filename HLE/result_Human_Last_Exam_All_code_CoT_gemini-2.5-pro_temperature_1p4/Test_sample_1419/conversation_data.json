    "To find the leading-order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in the `ϕ^4` theory near four dimensions, we will use the renormalization group (RG) method.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  We will start with the one-loop beta function, `β(u)`, for the `ϕ^4` coupling constant `u`. This function is derived in the context of dimensional regularization in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, where `ϵ` is a small parameter.\n2.  A fixed point of the RG flow, denoted as `u*`, is a point where the coupling constant becomes scale-invariant. This happens when the beta function is equal to zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  We will set the expression for `β(u)` to zero and solve the resulting algebraic equation for `u*`.\n4.  This equation has a trivial solution (`u* = 0`) corresponding to the free theory (the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial solution (`u* ≠ 0`) which is of interest (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point).\n5.  The final Python code will print this derivation step-by-step and then display the final expression for the non-trivial fixed point `u*` in terms of `ϵ`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the derivation for the fixed point coupling u*\n    in phi^4 theory and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using sympy for symbolic representation, though not strictly necessary for this problem.\n    # It helps in showing the symbols clearly.\n    u = sympy.Symbol('u')\n    epsilon = sympy.Symbol('epsilon')\n    pi = sympy.Symbol('pi')\n    u_star = sympy.Symbol('u*')\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The one-loop beta function for the coupling u in phi^4 theory\")\n    print(\"in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions is given by:\")\n    # The coefficient 3 comes from the three possible one-loop diagrams (s,t,u channels).\n    # The 16*pi^2 factor is standard from one-loop integrals in 4 dimensions.\n    beta_function_expr = -epsilon * u + (3 / (16 * pi**2)) * u**2\n    print(f\"β(u) = {sympy.pretty(beta_function_expr)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: A fixed point u* is found where the beta function is zero.\")\n    print(\"β(u*) = 0\")\n    print(f\"0 = -epsilon*u* + (3 / (16*pi^2)) * (u*)^2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Solve the equation for the non-trivial fixed point (u* != 0).\")\n    print(\"epsilon*u* = (3 / (16*pi^2)) * (u*)^2\")\n    print(\"Dividing by u* (since we seek the non-trivial solution):\")\n    print(\"epsilon = (3 / (16*pi^2)) * u*\")\n    print(\"Solving for u*:\")\n    print(\"u* = epsilon * (16*pi^2 / 3)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Final Answer: The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is:\")\n    \n    # Define the numerical parts of the expression\n    numerator = 16\n    denominator = 3\n    \n    # Output the final expression with each number clearly shown.\n    # This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    print(f\"u* = ({numerator} / {denominator}) * pi^2 * epsilon\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_fixed_point_coupling()\n```\n<<<(16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
