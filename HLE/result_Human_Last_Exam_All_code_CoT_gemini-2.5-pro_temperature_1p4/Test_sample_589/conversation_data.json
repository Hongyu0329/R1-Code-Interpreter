    "My plan is to first identify the movie that matches the user's very specific scene description. I will access my knowledge base of popular films to find a match for a teenager on a pink bike riding toward a car. Once the movie is identified, I will write a simple Python script to print this information, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the details of a specific movie scene\n    described by the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"It\"\n    movie_year = 2017\n    character = \"Beverly Marsh\"\n    scene_description = (\n        f\"In the 2017 feature film '{movie_title}', the teenage character {character} \"\n        \"rides her pink/reddish bicycle and pedals directly toward an oncoming car \"\n        \"to confront the bullies inside.\"\n    )\n\n    print(scene_description)\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<It (2017)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
