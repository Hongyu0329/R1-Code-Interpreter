# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of spaces X
# with certain properties. Based on topological theorems, the condition that
# the configuration space C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2 for a
# compact connected metric space X is equivalent to X being an arc.
#
# An arc is any space homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].
# All arcs belong to the same homeomorphism class.
#
# Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.

# The number of homeomorphism classes
num_classes = 1

print(f"The number of distinct homeomorphism classes for such X is: {num_classes}")
