# Based on the analytical solution, the expression to evaluate simplifies greatly.
# The original expression is: (10**5 + 10**-5)*x3(ln(10**5)) + (3/4)*10**(-20/3)
# Let's calculate the value of each of these two terms.

# The first term is: (10**5 + 10**-5)*x3(ln(10**5))
# This evaluates to: (3/2)*10**(10/3) - (3/4)*10**(-20/3) + 37/4
term1_val = (1.5 * (10**(10/3))) - (0.75 * (10**(-20/3))) + (37/4)

# The second term is: (3/4)*10**(-20/3)
term2_val = 0.75 * (10**(-20/3))

# The final result is the sum of these two terms.
# Notice that the (3/4)*10**(-20/3) parts will cancel out.
final_value = term1_val + term2_val

# As requested, here are the numbers in the final calculation
print(f"The first term of the expression, (10^5 + 10^-5)*x3(ln(10^5)), is: {term1_val}")
print(f"The second term of the expression, (3/4)*10^(-20/3), is: {term2_val}")

# The final sum is simply (3/2)*10**(10/3) + 37/4
print(f"The final result is the sum of these two terms: {final_value}")
