# Based on the riddle's clues, the sequence of numbers has been determined.
# The riddle refers to the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 0.
# The final order is derived from the positional clues provided.

# The numbers in their correct positions in the sequence.
num_pos_1 = 1
num_pos_2 = 2
num_pos_3 = 4
num_pos_4 = 3
num_pos_5 = 0

# The instruction mentions a "final equation". We will represent this as a sum
# to clearly display each number in the determined order.
total_sum = num_pos_1 + num_pos_2 + num_pos_3 + num_pos_4 + num_pos_5

# Print the final equation, showing each number in the correct order.
print(f"{num_pos_1} + {num_pos_2} + {num_pos_3} + {num_pos_4} + {num_pos_5} = {total_sum}")
