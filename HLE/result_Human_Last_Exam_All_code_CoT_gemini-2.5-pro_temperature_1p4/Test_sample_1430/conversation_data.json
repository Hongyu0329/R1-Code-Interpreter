    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate the Neron-Severi Group of X to the Jacobian of C**: I will first identify the geometric nature of $X = C^{(15)}$. The curve $C$ has genus $g=3$ and the symmetric power is of degree $d=15$. Since $d \\ge 2g-1$ (i.e., $15 \\ge 2(3)-1=5$), the 15th symmetric power $X$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety $J(C)$ of the curve $C$.\n2.  **Use the Projective Bundle Formula**: For a variety $E$ that is a projective bundle over a base $B$, the rank of the Neron-Severi group (also known as the Picard number) follows the formula $\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + 1$. In our case, this means $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n3.  **Find the Range for $\\rho(J(C))$**: The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of $J(C)$. $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety.\n    *   The **minimum rank** occurs for a *generic* curve $C$, where the endomorphism ring of $J(C)$ is just the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, $\\rho(J(C))=1$.\n    *   The **maximum rank** occurs for a special curve $C$ whose Jacobian has the largest possible endomorphism ring (complex multiplication). For a $g$-dimensional abelian variety, the maximum rank is $g^2$. Here, $g=3$, so the maximum rank is $3^2=9$. This is achieved, for instance, by the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ranks**: Using the formula from step 2 and the ranks from step 3, I will calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\n5.  **Code the Solution**: I will provide a Python script that implements these calculations and prints the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X,\n    the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Given parameters\n    g = 3  # genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^({d}), where C is a curve of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Relate rho(X) to the Jacobian J(C).\")\n    \n    # Check the condition for X being a projective bundle over J(C)\n    condition_val = 2 * g - 1\n    print(f\"For a symmetric power C^(d) to be a projective bundle over the Jacobian J(C), we must have d >= 2*g - 1.\")\n    print(f\"In this case, d = {d} and 2*g - 1 = {condition_val}.
