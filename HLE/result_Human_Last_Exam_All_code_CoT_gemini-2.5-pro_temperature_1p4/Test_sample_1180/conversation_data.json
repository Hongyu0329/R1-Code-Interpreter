    "My approach is to solve this problem by calculating the minimal discriminant of the curve and then using a standard formula from the theory of arithmetic geometry that relates this discriminant to the properties of the stable reduction.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ from the curve equation.\n2.  Calculate the discriminant of this polynomial, $\\Delta_f$.\n3.  The genus of the curve $z^2 = f(x)$ is $g=2$. The discriminant of the curve, $\\Delta_C$, is given by the formula $\\Delta_C = 2^{4(g-1)}\\Delta_f$. I will compute the 2-adic valuation of $\\Delta_C$, denoted $v_2(\\Delta_C)$. This valuation corresponds to the minimal discriminant for this curve.\n4.  The curve has potentially good reduction. For such a curve, Saito's formula connects the valuation of the minimal discriminant to the total thickness of the nodes of the stable reduction, $\\delta_{tot}$. The formula is $v_2(\\Delta_C) = 2g - 2 + \\delta_{tot}$.\n5.  I will solve this equation for $\\delta_{tot}$.\n6.  The problem asks for the thickness of \"the\" double point, implying there is only one. Thus, this single point's thickness is $\\delta_{tot}$. The script will print the final equation used to find this value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_thickness():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = 2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1\n    g = 2\n\n    print(f\"The curve is defined by z^2 = f(x), where f(x) = {f}.\")\n    print(f\"This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial f(x)\n    delta_f = sympy.discriminant(f, x)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The discriminant of the polynomial f(x) is Delta_f = {delta_f}.\")\n\n    # Helper function for 2-adic valuation\n    def val_2(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return float('inf')\n        n = abs(int(n))\n        count = 0\n        while n > 0 and n % 2 == 0:\n            count += 1\n            n //= 2\n        return count\n\n    v2_delta_f = val_2(delta_f)\n    print(f\"The 2-adic valuation of Delta_f is v2(Delta_f) = {v2_delta_f}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the 2-adic valuation of the curve's discriminant\n    # Formula: v2(Delta_C) = 4*(g-1) + v2(Delta_f)\n    v2_delta_c_val = 4 * (g - 1) + v2_delta_f\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: The 2-adic valuation of the curve's minimal discriminant, v2(Delta_C), is calculated.\")\n    print(f\"Using the formula v2(Delta_C) = 4*(g-1) + v2(Delta_f):\")\n    print(f\"v2(Delta_C) = 4*({g}-1) + {v2_delta_f} = {v2_delta_c_val}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply Saito's formula for curves with potentially good reduction\n    # v2(Delta_C) = 2g - 2 + delta_tot\n    print(\"Step 3: Apply Saito's formula for a curve of genus g with potentially good reduction:\")\n    print(\"v2(Delta_C) = 2*g - 2 + delta_tot, where delta_tot is the total thickness of the nodes.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Solve for delta_tot\n    rhs_const = 2*g - 2\n    delta_tot = v2_delta_c_val - rhs_const\n\n    print(\"\\nSolving for delta_tot:\")\n    print(f\"{v2_delta_c_val} = 2*{g} - 2 + delta_tot\")\n    print(f\"{v2_delta_c_val} = {rhs_const} + delta_tot\")\n    print(f\"delta_tot = {v2_delta_c_val} - {rhs_const} = {delta_tot}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"The problem asks for the thickness of 'the' double point, suggesting there is only one.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the thickness of the double point is {delta_tot}.\")\n\nsolve_curve_thickness()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
