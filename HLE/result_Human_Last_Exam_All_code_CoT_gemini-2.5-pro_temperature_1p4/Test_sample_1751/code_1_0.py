# Define the names of the two lipids
lipid_1 = "C16-dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0)"
lipid_2 = "C16-ceramide (d18:1/16:0)"

# Reasoning:
# C16-dihydroceramide has two fully saturated hydrocarbon chains.
# Saturated chains are straight and can pack together very tightly and in an ordered manner.
# C16-ceramide has one saturated chain and one unsaturated chain (with a trans double bond).
# The double bond disrupts the perfect packing, leading to a less ordered arrangement and more space between molecules.
# Tighter packing results in a smaller area per molecule.
# Therefore, C16-dihydroceramide will have a lower surface area when compressed.
