    "Here is my plan to address your request:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Statement:** I will break down the terms \"polygenic score (PGS)\", \"variance explained\" (often denoted as R²), and \"SNP heritability\" (h²_SNP).\n2.  **Explain the Relationship:** I'll clarify that SNP heritability represents the *theoretical maximum* proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It's an upper bound. A PGS is a *practical predictor* built from real-world data (a GWAS), which has limitations like finite sample sizes and imperfect effect size estimates.\n3.  **Illustrate with Code:** I will write a Python script to illustrate this concept. The script will:\n    *   Define hypothetical, but realistic, values for SNP heritability and the variance explained by a PGS for a given trait.\n    *   Print out an explanation of why the variance explained by a PGS is practically always lower than the SNP heritability.\n    *   Use these values to form a clear inequality that demonstrates the relationship, fulfilling the instruction to show an \"equation with numbers\".\n4.  **Provide the Final Answer:** Conclude with the final True/False answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_pgs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the relationship between SNP heritability and\n    the predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (PGS).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Define Key Concepts and Hypothetical Values ---\n    \n    # SNP Heritability (h²_SNP): The total proportion of phenotypic variance\n    # that is theoretically explainable by all the SNPs included in a GWAS.\n    # It represents the theoretical maximum predictive power.\n    # Let's assume for a trait like height, it's 50%.\n    snp_heritability = 0.50\n\n    # Polygenic Score R² (R²_PGS): The actual variance explained when a PGS\n    # is applied to a new sample.
