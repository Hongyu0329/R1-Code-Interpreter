    Analyzes plasmid combinations for co-expression in E. coli.

    To successfully co-express a protein of interest and a chaperone from two
    separate plasmids, the plasmids must have:
    1. Different antibiotic resistance markers for selection.
    2. Compatible origins of replication (ori) to ensure stable maintenance.

    Plasmid Origin of Replication (Incompatibility Groups):
    - pET, pGEX, pASK vectors: ColE1-type origin (incompatible with each other).
    - pCDF vectors: CDF origin (compatible with ColE1).

    Let's evaluate the options:
