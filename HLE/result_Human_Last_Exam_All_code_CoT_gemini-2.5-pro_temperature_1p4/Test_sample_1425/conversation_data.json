    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the corresponding Python code to display the result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\nMy plan is to first determine the correct operator for the partition function calculation and then evaluate the trace over the system's states. While the prompt asks for a path integral derivation, the operator formalism is more direct for this specific Hamiltonian and yields the identical result. I will outline both for completeness and then provide a Python script to print the final equation.\n\n**1. The Grand Canonical Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function (Z) in the grand canonical ensemble is defined as:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β(H - μN)))`\nwhere:\n*   `Tr` is the trace over all states in the Fock space.\n*   `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature.\n*   `H` is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential.\n*   `N` is the particle number operator.\n\n**2. Substituting the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe problem specifies a very particular Hamiltonian: `H = -μN`. We substitute this into the grand canonical expression:\n`H - μN = (-μN) - μN = -2μN`\n\nTherefore, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β(-2μN))) = Tr(e^(2βμN))`\n\n**3. Evaluating the Trace (Operator Formalism)**\n\nThe particle number operator `N` is the sum of number operators `N_k` for each individual single-particle state (or mode) `k`: `N = ∑_k N_k`. The expression becomes:\n`Z = Tr(e^(2βμ ∑_k N_k)) = Tr(∏_k e^(2βμN_k))`\n\nSince the operators for different modes commute, the trace of the product is the product of the traces:\n`Z = ∏_k Tr_k(e^(2βμN_k))`\n\nNow, we must assume the statistics of the particles. For **bosons**, the occupation number `n_k` of any mode `k` can be any non-negative integer `(0, 1, 2, ...)`:\n`Tr_k(e^(2βμN_k)) = ∑_{n_k=0 to ∞} <n_k| e^(2βμ n_k) |n_k> = ∑_{n_k=0 to ∞} (e^(2βμ))^{n_k}`\n\nThis is a geometric series. For it to converge, the absolute value of the ratio `r = e^(2βμ)` must be less than 1, which requires `μ < 0`. Under this condition, the sum is `1 / (1 - r)`.\n`Tr_k(e^(2βμN_k)) = 1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))`\n\nThe total partition function is the product over all modes `k`:\n`Z = ∏_k [1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))]`\n\n**4. Path Integral Formalism (Outline)**\n\nThe path integral formulation leads to the same result.\n1.  The grand canonical partition function is given by the path integral `Z = ∫D[ψ*,ψ] e^(-S)`, where S is the Euclidean action.\n2.  The action is `S = ∫dτ d³x ψ*(∂_τ + H - μ)ψ`. With our effective Hamiltonian `H - μN = -2μN`, the action becomes `S = ∫dτ d³x ψ*(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ`.\n3.  This is a standard Gaussian integral over the fields `ψ` and `ψ*`. Evaluating this integral (e.g., by finding the determinant of the operator `∂_τ - 2μ`) yields `ln(Z) = -∑_k ln(1 - e^(2βμ))`.\n4.  Exponentiating this gives `Z = ∏_k [1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))]`, matching the operator formalism result.\n\nThe following Python code will print this final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the symbolic formula for the partition function Z\n    for a system with Hamiltonian H = -μN in the grand canonical ensemble.\n    The formula is derived assuming the particles are bosons.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Using unicode characters for better readability\n    beta = \"\\u03B2\"  # β\n    mu = \"\\u03BC\"    # μ\n    prod_symbol = \"\\u220F\"  # Π\n    sum_symbol = \"\\u2211\"   # Σ\n\n    print(\"The grand canonical partition function Z for a system of bosons with Hamiltonian H = -μN is:\")\n    # The final equation includes the numbers 1 and 2 explicitly as requested.\n    print(f\"Z = {prod_symbol}_k [ 1 / (1 - exp(2 * {beta} * {mu})) ]\")\n    print(\"\\nThis result holds for μ < 0 to ensure the series converges.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe logarithm of the partition function, which is often used to find thermodynamic potentials, is:\")\n    print(f\"log(Z) = -{sum_symbol}_k log( 1 - exp(2 * {beta} * {mu}) )\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_partition_function()\n```\n<<<Z = Product_k [1 / (1 - exp(2*beta*mu))]>>>"
