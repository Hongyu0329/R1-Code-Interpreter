# The user is asking to identify a protein that normally prevents macrophage engulfment of amyloid.
# When this protein's function is disrupted ("broken down" or inhibited), the engulfment is allowed to proceed.
# This describes a "don't eat me" signal. The key protein in this pathway is CD47.
# CD47 on the surface of cells (and found on amyloid plaques) binds to the SIRP-alpha receptor on macrophages,
# sending an inhibitory signal that prevents phagocytosis.
# Blocking this interaction allows macrophages/microglia to clear amyloid plaques.

protein_name = "CD47"
