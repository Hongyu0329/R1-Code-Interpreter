    "My plan is to identify the protein that acts as an inhibitory signal for phagocytosis, specifically in the context of amyloid clearance by macrophages (or microglia in the brain). This protein is often referred to as a \"don't eat me\" signal. When this protein's function is blocked, inhibited, or \"broken,\" it allows the phagocytic cells to engulf their target, such as amyloid plaques. I will then provide a simple Python script that prints the name of this protein to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking to identify a protein that normally prevents macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n# When this protein's function is disrupted (\"broken down\" or inhibited), the engulfment is allowed to proceed.\n# This describes a \"don't eat me\" signal. The key protein in this pathway is CD47.\n# CD47 on the surface of cells (and found on amyloid plaques) binds to the SIRP-alpha receptor on macrophages,\n# sending an inhibitory signal that prevents phagocytosis.\n# Blocking this interaction allows macrophages/microglia to clear amyloid plaques.\n\nprotein_name = \"CD47\"\n\nprint(f\"The protein that, when blocked or 'broken down', allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is: {protein_name}\")\n```\n<<<CD47>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
