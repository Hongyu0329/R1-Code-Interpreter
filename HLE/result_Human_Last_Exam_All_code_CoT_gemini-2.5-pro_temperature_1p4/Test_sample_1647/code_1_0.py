# Plan:
# 1. Define constants and convert them to SI units (meters, seconds).
# 2. Use Pandora's orbital data to calculate Pegasi's Schwarzschild radius (Rs).
#    Kepler's 3rd Law: T^2 = (4*pi^2*a^3)/(G*M) => M = (4*pi^2*a^3)/(G*T^2)
#    Schwarzschild Radius: Rs = (2*G*M)/c^2
#    Combining them eliminates G: Rs = (8*pi^2*a^3)/(c^2*T^2)
# 3. Calculate the time dilation factor (f) for the probe Pioneer at d = 13 km.
#    f = sqrt(d / (Rs + d))
# 4. Determine the memory usage (z) for a memory-efficient Bagua C program.
#    This involves listing the necessary variables and their corresponding Bagua data types.
# 5. Print the breakdown of the final equation and the final answer in "f:z" format.

# --- Step 1: Define constants and convert to SI units ---

# Pioneer's distance from event horizon
d_km = 13
d_m = d_km * 1000

# Pandora's orbital radius
a_km = 100_000_000
a_m = a_km * 1000

# Pandora's orbital period
T_days = 800
T_s = T_days * 24 * 60 * 60

# Physical constants
c_mps = 3e8  # Speed of light in m/s
pi = 22/7    # Using the fractional representation suitable for Bagua 'frac' type

# --- Step 2: Calculate Schwarzschild Radius (Rs) ---
Rs_numerator = 8 * (pi**2) * (a_m**3)
Rs_denominator = (c_mps**2) * (T_s**2)
Rs = Rs_numerator / Rs_denominator

# --- Step 3: Calculate Time Dilation Factor (f) ---
f = math.sqrt(d_m / (Rs + d_m))

# --- Step 4: Determine Memory Usage (z) ---

# To perform this calculation on Bagua, we need variables for the constants and results.
# We choose the most memory-efficient type for each.
# - a (1e11), T (6.9e7), c (3e8) are too large for 'int', requiring 'frac'.
# - pi is a fraction, stored as 'frac'.
# - d (13000) is too large for 'wchar' (max 4095), requiring 'int'.
# - Rs and factor are results of 'frac' arithmetic, requiring 'frac'.

# Variable count:
# 'frac' types: a, T, c, pi, Rs, factor (6 variables)
# 'int' types: d (1 variable)
num_frac_vars = 6
num_int_vars = 1

# Memory size from Bagua spec:
trits_per_frac = 8  # 24 bits
trits_per_int = 8   # 24 bits

# Total memory usage z in trits
z = (num_frac_vars * trits_per_frac) + (num_int_vars * trits_per_int)

# --- Step 5: Output the result ---

# Per the request, output each number in the final equation for f.
print("Final Equation: f = sqrt(d / (Rs + d))")
print(f"d = {d_m} m")
print(f"Rs = {Rs:.3f} m") # Schwarzschild Radius rounded for display
print("") # Newline for separation

# Final answer in f:z format. f is rounded to 0.001.
final_f = round(f, 3)
print("Answer (f:z):")
print(f"{final_f:.3f}:{z}")
