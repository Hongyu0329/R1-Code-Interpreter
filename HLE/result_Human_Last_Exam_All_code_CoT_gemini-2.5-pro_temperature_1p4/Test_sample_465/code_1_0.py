# This script verifies that statement B is true and prints the final answer.

# Statement B claims that chromatic roots may not be real.
# We can test this with the chromatic polynomial of the 4-cycle graph, C_4.
# The polynomial is P(k) = k(k-1)(k^2 - 3k + 3).
# Its roots are 0, 1, and the roots of the quadratic factor k^2 - 3k + 3.
# We will find the roots of this quadratic factor using numpy.
# The coefficients of the polynomial k^2 - 3k + 3 are [1, -3, 3].
coeffs = [1, -3, 3]
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# The existence of complex roots (with non-zero imaginary parts) will confirm
# that statement B is true.

# Based on the analysis of all statements (A-E), the true ones are B, C, and D.
# The final answer is the sorted string of these letters.
