    print("    - Center of Inversion (i): Absent. The structure is chiral.")
    print("    - Mirror Planes (sigma): Absent. The chelate rings are puckered (non-planar) and the methyl groups break any potential planes.")
    print("    - Rotation Axes (Cn): A C2 axis can be found that passes through the copper atom and relates the two identical ligands to each other. However, the perpendicular C2 axes required for a D point group are absent because the ligand itself is not symmetric once coordinated.")
