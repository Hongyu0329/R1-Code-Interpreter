    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we need to consult the classification of such groups provided by deep results in the theory of elliptic curves.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the problem:** We are looking for the maximum possible size of a group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m > 1$, where this group is the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n2.  **Consult mathematical literature:** The classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields is a complex topic. For quadratic fields like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, a complete list of possible torsion structures is known. This classification includes special results for curves with Complex Multiplication (CM), which can possess larger torsion subgroups than non-CM curves. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is a CM field, and elliptic curves with CM by its ring of integers have special properties.\n\n3.  **Compile the list of possible groups:** Based on research papers (notably by Kenku, Momose, and Najman), the non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (This group is only possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ for a CM curve).\n\n4.  **Calculate the orders and find the maximum:** I will write a Python script to compute the order of each group in the list and identify the maximum value. The script will print each calculation.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups G = Z/mZ x Z/nZ\n    # for an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)) is known from number theory.\n    # The pairs (m, n) below represent these groups.\n    possible_groups = [\n        (2, 2),  # Z/2Z x Z/2Z\n        (2, 4),  # Z/2Z x Z/4Z\n        (2, 6),  # Z/2Z x Z/6Z\n        (3, 3),  # Z/3Z x Z/3Z\n        (3, 6),  # Z/3Z x Z/6Z\n        (6, 6)   # Z/6Z x Z/6Z (special case for CM curves over Q(sqrt(-3)))\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    max_group = None\n\n    print(\"Calculating orders of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups:\")\n    for m, n in possible_groups:\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"For group Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z, the order is {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            max_group = (m, n)\n\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The largest possible order is found for the group Z/{0}Z x Z/{1}Z.\".format(max_group[0], max_group[1]))\n    print(f\"The calculation for the largest order is: {max_group[0]} * {max_group[1]} = {max_order}\")\n    print(f\"The largest order is: {max_order}\")\n\nfind_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
