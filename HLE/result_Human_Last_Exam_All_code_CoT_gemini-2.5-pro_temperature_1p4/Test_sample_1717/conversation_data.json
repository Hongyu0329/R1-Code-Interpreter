    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** I will first find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I will find the formula the game uses to increase boss health based on the number of players in the game, specifically for Expert Mode.\n3.  **Construct the Equation:** I will combine the base health and the scaling formula into a single equation.\n4.  **Analyze for Infinite Players:** Finally, I will analyze the behavior of this equation as the number of players approaches infinity to determine the theoretical maximum health.\n\nBased on this plan, I will provide a Python script that prints out the formula and the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_terraria_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define constants based on Terraria's mechanics.\n    # In Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu's base health for one player is 3640.\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n\n    # In Expert Mode, health increases by 35% of the base for each player after the first.\n    per_player_increase_multiplier = 0.35\n\n    # Step 3: Present the formula.\n    print(\"The health scaling formula for a boss in Expert Mode is:\")\n    print(\"Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * PlayerMultiplier)\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu, we plug in the specific numbers:\")\n\n    # As requested, printing the final equation with each number.\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health_expert} * (1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * {per_player_increase_multiplier})\")\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze for an infinite number of players.\n    print(\"\\nThis formula shows that the Total Health increases linearly with the 'NumberOfPlayers'.\")\n    print(\"As the 'NumberOfPlayers' approaches infinity, the 'Total Health' also increases without any upper limit.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health()\n```\n<<<infinite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
