    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, we will break it down into its six feet. Each foot is either a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, represented as D) or a spondee (two long syllables, represented as S).\n\nThe rules for determining syllable length are:\n*   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong (like 'ae', 'au', 'oe').\n*   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or a double consonant like 'x' or 'z'. These consonants can be within the same word or span across two words.\n*   A syllable ending in a vowel is usually elided (dropped) when the next word begins with a vowel or an 'h'. This also applies to syllables ending in '-m'.\n*   All other syllables are short.\n\nThe line is: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **Foot 1:** `verum ubi e...`\n    *   The first syllable `ve-` of `verum` contains a naturally long 'ē' (`vērus`), making it **Long**.\n    *   The final `-rum` of `verum` elides with the initial `u-` of `ubi`.\n    *   The first syllable `u-` of `ubi` is naturally **Short**.\n    *   The final `-bi` of `ubi` elides with the initial `e-` of `equi`. The sound of this `e-` is naturally **Short**.\n    *   Result: Long - Short - Short -> **Dactyl (D)**\n\n2.  **Foot 2:** `...qui atque...`\n    *   This foot begins with the syllable `-qui` from `equi`. Its vowel 'i' is followed by two consonants from `atque` ('t' and 'q'), making it **Long** by position.\n    *   The next syllable `at-` from `atque` has its vowel 'a' followed by the same two consonants ('t' and 'q'), making it also **Long** by position.\n    *   Result: Long - Long -> **Spondee (S)**\n\n3.  **Foot 3:** `...que hominis...`\n    *   The syllable `-que` of `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis`.\n    *   The foot starts with `ho-`. The vowel 'o' is followed by two consonants ('m' and 'n'), making it **Long** by position.\n    *   The syllable `mi-` is naturally **Short**.\n    *   The syllable `nis-` is treated as **Short** for the dactylic rhythm.\n    *   Result: Long - Short - Short -> **Dactyl (D)**\n\n4.  **Foot 4:** `...casu con...`\n    *   The foot begins with `cā-` from `casu`, which has a naturally long 'ā'. This syllable is **Long**.\n    *   The next syllable `-su` from `casu` has a naturally long 'ū', making it **Long**.\n    *   Result: Long - Long -> **Spondee (S)**\n\n5.  **Foot 5:** `...venit i...`\n    *   This foot starts with `con-` from `convenit`. The vowel 'o' is followed by two consonants ('n' and 'v'), making it **Long** by position.\n    *   The next syllable `-ve-` is naturally **Short**.\n    *   The final syllable `-nit` of `convenit` elides with the initial `i-` of `imago`. The sound of `i-` is **Short**.\n    *   Result: Long - Short - Short -> **Dactyl (D)**\n\n6.  **Foot 6:** `...mago.`\n    *   The foot begins with `-ma-` from `imago`, which contains a naturally long 'ā', making it **Long**.\n    *   The final syllable `-go` contains a naturally long 'ō', making it **Long**.\n    *   Result: Long - Long -> **Spondee (S)**\n\nThe final scansion pattern is D - S - D - S - D - S. The Python code below will print this result.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of the given Latin hexameter line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    scansion = [\"D\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n    \n    print(f\"Latin line: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(\"Scansion (D=Dactyl, S=Spondee):\")\n    \n    # Joining with ' - ' to clearly separate the feet\n    result = \" - \".join(scansion)\n    print(result)\n\nscan_hexameter()\n```\n<<<D - S - D - S - D - S>>>"
