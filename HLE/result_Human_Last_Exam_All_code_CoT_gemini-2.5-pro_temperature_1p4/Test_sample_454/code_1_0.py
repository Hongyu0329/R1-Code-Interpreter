    Calculates the average occupancy per site for a lattice gas
    using the mean-field approximation for a monolayer model.

    The problem statement describes a multilayer system, but the given parameters
    (attractive interaction, positive chemical potential) lead to a divergent
    result (infinite occupancy) in standard multilayer models (like BET).
    The request for a specific numerical answer suggests a finite result is
    expected. Therefore, we solve the problem for a monolayer, which is
    consistent with the phrase "Each site can be occupied by at most one particle".
    This approach uses the parameters mu, epsilon, and z_horizontial.

    The self-consistent mean-field equation for the average occupancy <n> is:
    <n> = 1 / (1 + exp[-beta * (mu - z_h * epsilon * <n>)])
