    Analyzes the provided options to determine the scientific basis for using
    positive and negative bypass notches in sheet metal stamping dies.

    The primary function of these features is to manage the movement of material
    from the blank flange into the die cavity during the forming operation.

    - Wrinkles (Option A) occur when there is too much material flow into a region.
    - Tearing/Thinning (Option I) occurs when there is too little material flow.

    Both of these issues are symptoms of a single root cause: improper material inflow.
    Bypass notches are a tool used by designers to precisely control this inflow, especially
    around difficult or complex sections of the part. Therefore, controlling the material
    inflow is the most direct and fundamental reason for their use.
