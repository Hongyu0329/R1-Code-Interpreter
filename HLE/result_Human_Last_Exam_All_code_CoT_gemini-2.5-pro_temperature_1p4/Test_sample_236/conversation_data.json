    "I will determine the number of elements in the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_3^H$, that can be represented by integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and Representation Conditions:** The homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$ has exactly two elements: the trivial element (represented by the 3-sphere, $S^3$) and one non-trivial element (represented by the Poincar√© homology sphere). An integral surgery on a knot $K$ produces a homology sphere only if the surgery coefficient is $\\pm 1$.\n2.  **Analyze Surgery Cases:**\n    *   **-1 surgery:** For any knot $K$, a -1 surgery always yields the 3-sphere, $S^3$, which represents the trivial element. Thus, the trivial element is always representable.\n    *   **+1 surgery:** A +1 surgery on a knot $K$ represents the non-trivial element if and only if the knot's Arf invariant is 1. A well-known theorem states that the Arf invariant of a knot $K$ is 1 if and only if its Alexander polynomial evaluated at -1, $\\Delta_K(-1)$, is congruent to $\\pm 3 \\pmod 8$. Otherwise, the Arf invariant is 0, and the surgery yields the trivial element.\n3.  **Examine Relevant Knots:** I will check the knots with at most four crossings: the unknot ($0_1$), the trefoil knot ($3_1$), and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$). For each knot, I will calculate its Alexander polynomial at -1 and check the condition to see if the non-trivial element can be represented.\n4.  **Count the Represented Elements:** Based on the analysis, I will count how many of the two group elements (trivial and non-trivial) can be constructed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines how many elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented\n    by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The homology cobordism group has 2 elements: the trivial element and the non-trivial element.\")\n    print(\"An integral surgery on a knot K is a homology sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # The trivial element is always representable\n    print(\"Analysis of the trivial element:\")\n    print(\"For any knot K, -1 surgery on K results in the standard 3-sphere S^3, which represents the trivial element.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the trivial element can be represented.\")\n    trivial_element_found = True\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the non-trivial element:\")\n    print(\"A +1 surgery on a knot K represents the non-trivial element if and only if its Arf invariant is 1.\")\n    print(\"This is true if the Alexander polynomial at t=-1, Delta_K(-1), is congruent to 3 or 5 (mod 8).\")\n    print(\"We check the knots with at most 4 crossings: Unknot (0_1), Trefoil (3_1), Figure-Eight (4_1).\\n\")\n\n    non_trivial_element_found = False\n\n    # Knots and their properties\n    knots = {\n        \"Unknot (0_1)\": {\n            \"poly_str\": \"1\",\n            \"eval_str\": \"1\",\n            \"result\": 1\n        },\n        \"Trefoil (3_1)\": {\n            \"poly_str\": \"t**2 - t + 1\",\n            \"eval_str\": \"(-1)**2 - (-1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1\",\n            \"result\": 3\n        },\n        \"Figure-Eight (4_1)\": {\n            \"poly_str\": \"-t**2 + 3*t - 1\",\n            \"eval_str\": \"-(-1)**2 + 3*(-1) - 1 = -1 - 3 - 1\",\n            \"result\": -5\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through knots and check the condition\n    for name, data in knots.items():\n        print(f\"Knot: {name}\")\n        print(f\"  Alexander polynomial: Delta(t) = {data['poly_str']}\")\n        \n        # Display the calculation with each number\n        print(f\"  Calculation: Delta(-1) = {data['eval_str']} = {data['result']}\")\n        \n        # In Python, (-5) % 8 is 3, which is correct.\n        remainder = data['result'] % 8\n        if remainder == 3 or remainder == 5:\n            print(f\"  Result mod 8: {data['result']} % 8 = {remainder}.
