    # A. Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for the enzyme. Rga1 is reversible inhibitor. Mg cation is a cofactor.
    # Analysis: Rga1 is not reversible in a competitive manner.
    print("A: Incorrect. The data suggests Rga1 is an irreversible or non-competitive inhibitor, not simply 'reversible'.")
    
    # B. CaCl2 and MgCl2 are cofactors, CuCl2 is not a cofactor of Zma1.
    # Analysis: CaCl2 shows no effect (kcat 500/s), so it is not a cofactor.
    print("B: Incorrect. CaCl2 (kcat = 500/s) is not a cofactor.")
    
    # C. Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1. Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.
    # Analysis: This aligns perfectly with all our deductions.
    # - Al1 (activator) and Al2 (inhibitor) are modulators.
    # - The result of Al1+Al2 (kcat=150/s) equals the effect of Al2 alone, suggesting they compete for the same site.
    # - Rga1 is irreversible as its effect is not overcome by substrate.
    print("C: Correct. This statement is fully supported by the data.")
    
    # D. XAG1 and Rga1 are irreversible inhibitors. Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for the enzyme
    # Analysis: XAG1 inhibition is reversed by high substrate (kcat from 10/s to 450/s), so it is reversible.
    print("D: Incorrect. XAG1 is a reversible inhibitor.")
    
    # F. CaCl2, MgCl2, and CuCl2 are cofactors of Zma1, and XAG1 is a reversible inhibitor of Zma1.
    # Analysis: CaCl2 is not a cofactor and CuCl2 is an inhibitor.
    print("F: Incorrect. CaCl2 is not a cofactor and CuCl2 is an inhibitor.")

    # G. Al1 and Al2 are allosteric activators and they binds to different sites on Al1.
    # Analysis: Al2 is an inhibitor, not an activator.
    print("G: Incorrect. Al2 (kcat = 150/s) is an inhibitor.")
    
    # H. Rga1 is a reversible inhibitor, Mg ion is a cofactor, Al1 may function as an allosteric regulator of Zma1 and Al2 may also function as an allosteric regulator of Zma1.
    # Analysis: Rga1 is not shown to be reversible.
