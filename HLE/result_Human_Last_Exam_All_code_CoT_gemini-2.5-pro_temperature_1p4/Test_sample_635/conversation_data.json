    "To calculate a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D(s)^{-1} N(s)$. This is equivalent to $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is invertible, meaning its determinant is not the zero polynomial.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means they don't share any common non-unimodular left factors. A practical way to check this condition is to form the augmented matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ and verify that it has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find such a factorization:\n\n**Step 1: Choose a suitable denominator matrix D(s)**\nWe need to select a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that $D(s)H(s)$ results in a polynomial matrix $N(s)$. Let's analyze the product:\n\\[\nD(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor the resulting matrix to be polynomial, we need to choose the entries of $D(s)$ to eliminate the denominators.\nFor the first row, we require $d_{11}(s)$ to be a polynomial, and the term $d_{11}(s)\\frac{(s-1)^2}{s^2-1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ to also be a polynomial. A simple choice to satisfy these conditions is $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\nFor the second row, we have the same conditions on $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$. To ensure $D(s)$ is invertible and keep the polynomial degrees low, we can choose a different simple solution, for instance, $d_{21}(s)=0$. This choice forces $d_{22}(s)$ to be a multiple of $s^2-1$ to cancel the denominator. The simplest non-trivial choice is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\nThis gives us the candidate matrix:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the numerator matrix N(s)**\nNow we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1) \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 \\\\ 0 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s^2-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\cdot 1 + (s^2-1) \\cdot 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Verify Coprimeness**\nWe check that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full rank for all $s$. The matrix is:\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank can only drop below 2 if the two rows are linearly dependent. However, because of the constant entries (1 and 2) in columns 1, 3, and 4, the rows can never be all-zero or scalar multiples of each other. Therefore, the matrix has rank 2 for all $s$, which confirms that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code defines these matrices, verifies the factorization, and prints the elements of $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    for the given transfer function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sp.symbols('s')\n\n    # The given transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sp.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    # A left coprime factorization is found to be D(s) and N(s)\n    # D(s) is constructed to cancel the denominators in H(s)\n    D = sp.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    # N(s) is calculated as D(s) * H(s)\n    N = sp.simplify(D * H)\n\n    # --- Verification (optional, for confidence) ---\n    # 1.
