    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible equilibria for the given Lotka-Volterra system.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equilibrium Condition**: An equilibrium point `X = (X_1, ..., X_N)` is a state where the population abundances do not change, meaning `\\dot{X_i} = 0` for all species `i=1, ..., N`. I will start by writing down this system of equations.\n\n2.  **Identify the Structure of Equilibria**: The equation for each species `i` can be factored as `X_i * (some expression) = 0`. This implies that for any equilibrium, each species must either be extinct (`X_i = 0`) or satisfy a more complex condition (`(some expression) = 0`). This naturally partitions the set of all possible equilibria based on which subset of species is present (has non-zero abundance). The total number of such subsets for `N` species is `2^N`.\n\n3.  **Establish Uniqueness for Each Subset**: I will show that for any given subset of coexisting species, there is at most one possible equilibrium point where their abundances are all positive. This is done by transforming the system of equations for the non-zero abundances into a 2x2 linear system for two auxiliary variables, `Y = \\sum R_j X_j` and `Z = \\sum A_j R_j X_j`. A 2x2 linear system generally has a single unique solution, which in turn uniquely determines the abundances `X_i`.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Feasibility of Each Equilibrium Type**: The final step is to confirm that it's possible for every one of the `2^N` potential equilibria to exist for some choice of parameters `R_i, K_i, A_i, \\Gamma \\geq 1`. By analyzing the conditions for the abundances `X_i` to be positive, we can show that parameter values can be chosen to satisfy these conditions. For instance, in the case of `N=2`, we can find valid parameters for all `2^2=4` equilibria: `(0,0)`, `(K_1,0)`, `(0,K_2)`, and a coexistence point `(X_1, X_2)`. This principle generalizes to any `N`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Code**: Based on the analysis, the maximum number of possible equilibria is `2^N`. I will provide a Python script that encapsulates this result. The script will take a value of `N`, calculate `2^N`, and print the explanation and the final result in the requested format, including the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_lotka_volterra_equilibria(n_species):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of possible equilibria for a generalized\n    Lotka-Volterra system with N species.\n\n    The system is defined by:\n    dX_i/dt = R_i*X_i*(1 - X_i/K_i) + (Gamma/N) * sum_j( (A_i - A_j)*R_i*R_j*X_i*X_j )\n\n    Args:\n        n_species (int): The number of species (N) in the system.
