# --- Step-by-step reasoning ---

# Step 1: Establish the lower bound for lambda in X
# A tower is a maximal sequence, and it's a known result from set theory
# that any pseudo-decreasing sequence of length omega_1 has a lower bound
# (can be diagonalized), hence is not maximal.
# Thus, for any lambda in X, lambda must be greater than omega_1.
# Since lambda must be a regular cardinal, the smallest it can be is omega_2.
# So, inf(X) >= omega_2.
inf_X_lower_bound = omega_2
print(f"Step 1: The lower bound for any lambda in X is {inf_X_lower_bound}.")


# Step 2: Establish the upper bound for lambda in X
# A tower of length lambda is a strictly decreasing chain of length lambda in
# the quotient algebra P(omega_1)/countable.
# The length of a chain cannot exceed the size of the set it's in.
# The size of P(omega_1)/countable is 2^omega_1.
# The problem states 2^omega_1 = omega_2.
# Therefore, lambda <= omega_2.
sup_X_upper_bound = omega_2
print(f"Step 2: The upper bound for any lambda in X is {sup_X_upper_bound}.")

# Step 3: Determine the set X
# From steps 1 and 2, any lambda in X must satisfy omega_2 <= lambda <= omega_2.
# This implies that lambda must be omega_2.
# A known result states that under 2^omega_1 = omega_2, a tower of length omega_2 exists.
# Thus, the set X contains exactly one element.
X = {omega_2}
print(f"Step 3: The set X of possible regular lengths lambda is {{{omega_2}}}.")


# Step 4: Calculate delta_1 and delta_2
# delta_1 is the supremum of X and delta_2 is the infimum of X.
delta_1 = omega_2  # sup({omega_2})
delta_2 = omega_2  # inf({omega_2})
print(f"Step 4: From X, we find delta_1 = {delta_1} and delta_2 = {delta_2}.")

# Step 5: Compute the final result
# The sum is calculated using cardinal arithmetic.
final_sum = delta_1 + delta_2
