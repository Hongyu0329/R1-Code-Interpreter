    "I will first search for the common name of the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" and the year this common name was established. I will look through entomology databases, scientific publications, and authoritative guides on North American bees to find the most widely accepted common name and its origin. Once I have identified the name and the year it was formally proposed or popularized, I will format the answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name for the bee genus Perdita\n    and the year the name was popularized.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common name \"Fairy bees\" for the genus Perdita was popularized\n    # by the book \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\"\n    # by Joseph S.
