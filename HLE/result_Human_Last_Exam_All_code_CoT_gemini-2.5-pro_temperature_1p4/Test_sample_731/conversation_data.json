    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to understand the terms and the structure of the group.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In the standard notation for this family of groups, $SD_{2^n}$, the order is $2^n$. Therefore, for $SD_{512}$, we have $2^n = 512$, which gives $n=9$.\n2.  **Understand \"Power Subgroup\"**: A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group.\n3.  **Count the Cyclic Subgroups**: The elements of $SD_{2^n}$ are of two forms: those in the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ and those outside of it, of the form $sr^i$. We can count the distinct cyclic subgroups by considering these two sets of elements.\n    *   **Part A: Subgroups inside $\\langle r \\rangle$**: The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order $2^{n-1} = 2^{9-1} = 256$. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$. For $m=256=2^8$, there are $8+1=9$ divisors. Thus, there are 9 cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n    *   **Part B: Subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$**: These are generated by elements of the form $sr^i$.\n        *   When $i$ is even, the element $sr^i$ has order 2. There are $2^{n-2} = 2^{9-2} = 128$ such elements, and each generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n        *   When $i$ is odd, the element $sr^i$ has order 4. There are $2^{n-2} = 128$ such elements. A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators. These 128 elements form pairs, with each pair generating the same subgroup. Therefore, they generate $128 / 2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups.\n4.  **Calculate the Total**: The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from all parts.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the\n    semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the order is 2^n.\n    # We need to find the value of n.\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2. Got {group_size}\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # The number of power subgroups is the sum of three distinct types:\n    # 1. Subgroups of the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>, which is of order 2^(n-1).\n    #    The number of subgroups of a cyclic group C_m is tau(m), the number of\n    #    divisors of m. For m = 2^(n-1), tau(m) = (n-1) + 1 = n.\n    subgroups_in_r = n\n\n    # 2. Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form s*r^i where i is even.\n    #    These elements have order 2. There are 2^(n-2) such elements,\n    #    each generating a distinct subgroup.\n    subgroups_sr_even = 2**(n - 2)\n\n    # 3. Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form s*r^i where i is odd.\n    #    These elements have order 4. There are 2^(n-2) such elements, which\n    #    form pairs that generate the same subgroup. So there are\n    #    2^(n-2) / 2 = 2^(n-3) distinct subgroups.\n    subgroups_sr_odd = 2**(n - 3)\n\n    # The total is the sum of these three values.\n    total_subgroups = subgroups_in_r + subgroups_sr_even + subgroups_sr_odd\n\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is the sum of:\")\n    print(f\"- The {subgroups_in_r} cyclic subgroups contained in the maximal cyclic subgroup.\")\n    print(f\"- The {subgroups_sr_even} cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements outside the maximal cyclic subgroup.\")\n    print(f\"- The {subgroups_sr_odd} cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements outside the maximal cyclic subgroup.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{subgroups_in_r} + {subgroups_sr_even} + {subgroups_sr_odd} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<201>>>"
