    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the ship in question.\n\nFirst, I will compile a list of notable French ships that were sunk during the early stages of World War II. For each ship, I will record its name, type, tonnage (as a measure of size), the date it was sunk, and the cause of its sinking.\n\nNext, I will filter this list based on the user's specific criteria:\n1.  The ship must have been sunk by a U-boat.\n2.  The sinking must have occurred before the Franco-German Armistice, which was signed on June 22, 1940.\n\nFinally, I will compare the tonnages of the remaining ships to identify the largest one and then print its name and tonnage. The tonnage used will be Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) as it is the most consistently available metric for merchant vessels of that era.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest French ship by tonnage sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of French ships sunk in WWII.
