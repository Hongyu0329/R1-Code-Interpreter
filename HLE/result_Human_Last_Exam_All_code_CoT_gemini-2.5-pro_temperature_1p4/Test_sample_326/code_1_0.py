# The problem provides the condition that for every direction,
# there is a line `l` such that the dimension of its intersection
# with the compact set C is at least 1/2.
# Let's define this value as alpha.
alpha = 1/2

# From the reasoning provided, the condition on the set C implies a condition on its
# orthogonal projections. Namely, the Hausdorff dimension of the projection of C
# in every direction must be at least alpha.
# dim_H(P_v(C)) >= alpha for all directions v.

# A key theorem in geometric measure theory states that for such a set C,
# its Hausdorff dimension must be at least alpha + 1/2.
# dim_H(C) >= alpha + 1/2
# This lower bound is known to be sharp, meaning there exists a set that
# achieves this minimal dimension.

# We can now calculate the minimal possible dimension of C.
