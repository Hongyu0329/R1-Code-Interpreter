    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a plan to solve this literary riddle:\n\n1.  First, we identify the famous \"wide boulevards\" of Vienna. This is the Ringstrasse, which means \"Ring Street\" in German.\n2.  Next, we find the Russian word for \"ring,\" as the riddle mentions a Russian translation. The Russian word for \"ring\" is \"кольцо\" (pronounced \"kol'tso\").\n3.  Finally, we look for an English poet whose surname sounds phonetically similar to the Russian word \"кольцо.\" The surname \"Coleridge\" (as in Samuel Taylor Coleridge) is transliterated into Russian as \"Кольридж\" (Kol'ridzh), creating a well-known pun.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines this logic and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by connecting Vienna's boulevards\n    to an English poet's name through a Russian translation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the key location in Vienna.\n    vienna_boulevard_german = \"Ringstrasse\"\n    key_german_word = \"Ring\"\n    \n    print(f\"The wide boulevards of Vienna are known as the '{vienna_boulevard_german}'.\")\n    print(f\"The key German word in the name is '{key_german_word}'.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the Russian translation.\n    russian_word_for_ring = \"кольцо\"\n    pronunciation = \"kol'tso\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Russian word for 'ring' is '{russian_word_for_ring}', pronounced roughly as '{pronunciation}'.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the English poet with a similar-sounding surname.\n    english_poet_surname = \"Coleridge\"\n    russian_transliteration = \"Кольридж\"\n    \n    print(f\"The English poet's surname '{english_poet_surname}' is written as '{russian_transliteration}' in Russian.\")\n    print(f\"This creates a phonetic pun with the Russian word for ring '{russian_word_for_ring}'.\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the surname of the English poet is:\")\n    print(english_poet_surname)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Coleridge>>>"
