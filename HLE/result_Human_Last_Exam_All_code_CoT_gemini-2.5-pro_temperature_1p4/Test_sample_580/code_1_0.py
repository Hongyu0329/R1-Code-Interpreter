The patient's symptoms are consistent with sciatica. Given the unremarkable X-ray, a muscular cause like Piriformis Syndrome is a strong possibility.
The physical exam is set up to isolate and test the external rotator muscles of the hip.
The piriformis muscle is a primary external rotator of the hip.
To diagnose Piriformis Syndrome, the physician needs to provoke the patient's symptoms by engaging the piriformis muscle.
Asking the patient to perform {action_to_test_piriformis} against resistance will cause the piriformis muscle to contract forcefully.
If this contraction reproduces the patient's sciatic pain, it helps confirm the diagnosis of Piriformis Syndrome.
