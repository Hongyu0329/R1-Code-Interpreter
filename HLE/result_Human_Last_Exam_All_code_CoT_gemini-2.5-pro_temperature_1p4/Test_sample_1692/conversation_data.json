    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  I will define the top and bottom rows of the cellular automaton based on the values you provided.\n2.  The state of a cell in the next row is determined by a rule that considers the cell itself and its immediate left and right neighbors. For an elementary cellular automaton, there are 256 possible rules (from rule 0 to rule 255).\n3.  I will write a script that iterates through every one of these 256 rules.\n4.  For each rule, I will:\n    a. Apply the rule to the given top row to generate a potential middle row.\n    b. Apply the same rule to this new middle row to generate a potential bottom row.\n5.  I will then compare this generated bottom row with the one you provided (`10000111`).\n6.  If they match, I have found the correct rule and the correct intermediate step. Since the problem implies there is only one solution, the script will stop and print the result.\n7.  The final output will display the complete three-row sequence.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton\n    sequence by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The known top and bottom rows of the sequence.\n    top_row_str = \"01101001\"\n    bottom_row_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    # Convert the string representations to lists of integers for easier processing.\n    top_row = [int(cell) for cell in top_row_str]\n    bottom_row = [int(cell) for cell in bottom_row_str]\n    width = len(top_row)\n\n    # We will now iterate through all 256 possible elementary rules.\n    for rule_num in range(256):\n        # Convert the rule number (e.g., 90) to its 8-bit binary representation ('01011010').\n        # This binary string defines the output for the 8 possible neighborhoods,\n        # from '111', '110', ... down to '000'.\n        rule_bin = format(rule_num, '08b')\n        rule_map = {\n            (1, 1, 1): int(rule_bin[0]),\n            (1, 1, 0): int(rule_bin[1]),\n            (1, 0, 1): int(rule_bin[2]),\n            (1, 0, 0): int(rule_bin[3]),\n            (0, 1, 1): int(rule_bin[4]),\n            (0, 1, 0): int(rule_bin[5]),\n            (0, 0, 1): int(rule_bin[6]),\n            (0, 0, 0): int(rule_bin[7]),\n        }\n\n        # First, generate the potential middle row from the top row using the current rule.\n        middle_row_candidate = []\n        for i in range(width):\n            # We use periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around.\n            # The left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell.\n            left_neighbor = top_row[(i - 1 + width) % width]\n            current_cell = top_row[i]\n            # The right neighbor of the last cell is the first cell.\n            right_neighbor = top_row[(i + 1) % width]\n            \n            neighborhood = (left_neighbor, current_cell, right_neighbor)\n            \n            # Find the new cell state from the rule map and add it to our candidate row.\n            middle_row_candidate.append(rule_map[neighborhood])\n\n        # Second, generate a potential bottom row from our candidate middle row.\n        bottom_row_candidate = []\n        for i in range(width):\n            left_neighbor = middle_row_candidate[(i - 1 + width) % width]\n            current_cell = middle_row_candidate[i]\n            right_neighbor = middle_row_candidate[(i + 1) % width]\n            \n            neighborhood = (left_neighbor, current_cell, right_neighbor)\n            bottom_row_candidate.append(rule_map[neighborhood])\n\n        # Finally, check if our generated bottom row matches the known bottom row.\n        if bottom_row_candidate == bottom_row:\n            # If it matches, we have found the only valid solution.\n            middle_row_solution = \"\".join(map(str, middle_row_candidate))\n            \n            # Print each row in the final equation.\n            print(top_row_str)\n            print(middle_row_solution)\n            print(bottom_row_str)\n            \n            # The problem asks for the answer in a specific format at the very end.\n            # The solution is the intermediate step we found.\n            print(f\"\\n<<<{''.join(map(str, middle_row_candidate))}>>>\")\n            return\n\n# Run the solver function.\nsolve_cellular_automaton()\n```"
