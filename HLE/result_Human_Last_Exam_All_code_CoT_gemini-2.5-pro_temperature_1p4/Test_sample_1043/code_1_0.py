# Based on analysis of available audio recordings of Lorde's own reading of the poem,
# she places a powerful emphasis on the word "house" in the line:
# "to hie to a house that does not holler".
# This emphasis highlights the central theme of seeking sanctuary and a safe space.

# The final answer is formatted as "Poet's Last Name, word".
