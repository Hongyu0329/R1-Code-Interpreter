    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the Python code that calculates the connectivity of the specified map by detailing the steps of the topological argument.\n\nHere is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the connectivity of a specific map in algebraic topology: `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. They want the solution presented as Python code that explains its reasoning and prints the final result.\n\n2.  **Initial Simplification:** The first step is to simplify the spaces involved using standard results from topology.\n    *   The smash product of spheres is another sphere: `S⁴ ∧ S⁶ ≅ S¹⁰`.\n    *   This simplifies the target space to `ΩS¹⁰`.\n    *   The map is thus `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → ΩS¹⁰`.\n\n3.  **Strategy Formulation - The Adjoint Map:** The target space `ΩS¹⁰` is a loop space. Maps into a loop space `ΩY` are in one-to-one correspondence with maps into `Y` from the suspension of the domain. This is the suspension-loop space adjunction.\n    *   So, the map `f: A → ΩY` (where `A = Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)` and `Y = S¹⁰`) corresponds to an \"adjoint\" map `g: A → Y`. Wait, the adjunction is `[ΣX, Y] ≅ [X, ΩY]`. So `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → ΩS¹⁰` corresponds to a map `g': ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶ → Ω(ΩS¹⁰) = Ω²S¹⁰`. This seems more complex.\n    *   Let's reconsider. Maybe the user's map `f` is itself the adjoint of a more natural map. A map `g: A → S¹⁰` has an adjoint `ad(g): Σ⁻¹A → ΩS¹⁰`. This doesn't seem right either.\n    *   Let's assume the most standard interpretation: the properties of `f: X → ΩY` can be studied through its adjoint `g: ΣX → Y`. Let's denote the domain `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)` as `D`. The map is `f: D → ΩS¹⁰`. Its adjoint is `g: ΣD → S¹⁰`.\n    *   A key theorem states that a map and its adjoint have the same connectivity. So, the problem reduces to finding the connectivity of `g: Σ(Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)) → S¹⁰`.\n\n4.  **Calculating Connectivity of a Map:** The connectivity of a map `g: X → Y` is defined as the connectivity of its mapping cone, `C_g`. The connectivity of `C_g` can be determined using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair `(C_g, Y)`, which is related to the homotopy groups of `X` and `Y`.\n    *   The pair `(C_g, Y)` gives a long exact sequence:\n        `... → πᵢ(Y) → πᵢ(C_g) → πᵢ(C_g, Y) → πᵢ₋₁(Y) → ...`\n    *   A standard result is that `πᵢ(C_g, Y) ≅ πᵢ(C_g / Y)`.\n    *   The quotient `C_g / Y` is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the domain, `ΣX`.\n    *   So, the long exact sequence becomes:\n        `... → πᵢ(Y) → πᵢ(C_g) → πᵢ(ΣX) → πᵢ₋₁(Y) → ...`\n\n5.  **Executing the Calculation:**\n    *   Let `X = Σ(Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶))` and `Y = S¹⁰`.\n    *   I need the connectivity of `X` and `Y`.\n    *   **Connectivity of Y:** `conn(S¹⁰) = 10 - 1 = 9`. This means `πᵢ(S¹⁰) = 0` for `i ≤ 9`.\n    *   **Connectivity of X:** This requires a step-by-step calculation:\n        *   `conn(ΩS⁴) = 4 - 2 = 2`.\n        *   `conn(ΩS⁶) = 6 - 2 = 4`.\n        *   The connectivity of a smash product `A ∧ B` is `conn(A) + conn(B) + 1`. So, `conn(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7`.\n        *   The connectivity of a suspension `ΣA` is `conn(A) + 1`.\n        *   The space `X` is a double suspension of `ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶`. So, `conn(X) = conn(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9`. This means `πᵢ(X) = 0` for `i ≤ 9`.\n    *   **Analyzing the Long Exact Sequence:**\n        `... → πᵢ(S¹⁰) → πᵢ(C_g) → πᵢ(X) → πᵢ₋₁(S¹⁰) → ...`\n        For any `i ≤ 9`, the terms `πᵢ(S¹⁰)`, `πᵢ(X)`, and `πᵢ₋₁(S¹⁰)` are all zero.\n        The sequence becomes `... → 0 → πᵢ(C_g) → 0 → ...`.\n        This implies `πᵢ(C_g) = 0` for all `i ≤ 9`.\n    *   Therefore, the mapping cone `C_g` is 9-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of the map `g` is 9.\n    *   Since `conn(f) = conn(g)`, the connectivity of the original map `f` is also 9.\n\n6.  **Structuring the Code:** I will create a Python script that does not compute anything dynamically but rather uses `print` statements to walk through the logical steps outlined above. It will display the rules used (e.g., `conn(Sⁿ) = n-1`) and show the intermediate calculations, culminating in the final equation and answer as requested by the user.\n\nThis detailed plan ensures all constraints are met and the reasoning is sound and clearly explained.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n\n    This function prints a step-by-step explanation of the calculation based on\n    standard theorems in algebraic topology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Problem Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"We want to find the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Simplify the topological spaces.\")\n    print(\"Using the standard equivalence for the smash product of spheres, S^m wedge S^n = S^(m+n):\")\n    n_sphere_sum = 4 + 6\n    print(f\"S^4 wedge S^6 = S^({4}+{6}) = S^{n_sphere_sum}\")\n    print(\"So, the map simplifies to f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega S^10.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Define the domain and codomain and analyze the map's properties.\")\n    print(\"Let the domain be D = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6).\")\n    print(\"Let the codomain be C = Omega S^10.\")\n    print(\"The map f: D -> C has a codomain that is a loop space.\")\n    print(\"Due to the suspension-loop space adjunction, this map 'f' is the adjoint of a map 'g'.\")\n    print(\"g: Sigma(D) -> S^10.\")\n    print(\"A key theorem in homotopy theory states that a map and its adjoint have the same connectivity.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, conn(f) = conn(g).
