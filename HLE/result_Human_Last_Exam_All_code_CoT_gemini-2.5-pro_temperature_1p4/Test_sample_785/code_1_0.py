    This function calculates the number of orbits based on the analysis of the matrix algebra.

    The problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:
    m1 * d1 + m2 * d2 = N
    where:
    - N is the dimension of the matrices (1000).
    - d1 and d2 are the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the algebra.
    - m1 and m2 are their respective multiplicities.

    Our analysis showed that there are only two irreducible representations, and both are 1-dimensional.
