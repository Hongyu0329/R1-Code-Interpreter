    This function determines and prints the IUPAC name of the product from the described reaction.
    
    The reaction is an aza-Claisen rearrangement of N-(((S)-5-methylcyclopent-1-en-1-yl)methyl)-N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)propionamide.
    Step 1: Deprotonation with LiHMDS to form a lithium enolate.
    Step 2: Thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
    The stereochemistry of the product is controlled by the existing chiral centers in the starting material.
    
    - The (S)-1-phenylethyl chiral auxiliary directs the formation of the (2S) center.
    - The (S)-5-methylcyclopentenyl group's stereocenter is transferred, resulting in a (4S) center in the product ring.
    - The cis-double bond of the cyclopentene leads to a syn-relationship between the new stereocenters, resulting in a (1S) configuration at the ring junction.
    
    The final product after workup is a carboxylic acid.
