def solve_hat_puzzle():
    """
    This puzzle is a logic problem, not a computational one.
    The solution is derived from logical deduction and game theory,
    based on the strategy the team can devise.

    The Strategy:
    1. Two members, Alex (A) and Ben (B), are designated as 'Pivots'.
    2. The other 10 members are 'Deducers' (D1 to D10).
    3. The strategy consists of 20 pairings: for each Deducer Di,
       the pairs (A, Di) and (B, Di) are formed.

    The Logic:
    - Consider any Deducer, Di. Let their number be d_i, Alex's be 'a', and Ben's be 'b'.
    - From the pair (A, Di), a number n_ad is revealed. n_ad is in {a, d_i}.
    - From the pair (B, Di), a number n_bd is revealed. n_bd is in {b, d_i}.

    - The key insight is this: if n_ad == n_bd, then the number on Di's hat MUST be that number.
      Why? Let n_ad = n_bd = n. If Di's number is not n, then 'a' must be n AND 'b' must be n.
      This is a contradiction, as all hat numbers are unique.
      So, if the revealed numbers are the same, Di knows their number for sure.

    - The adversarial leader knows this. To prevent Di from being certain, the leader must try
      to make n_ad != n_bd. The leader can guarantee this by choosing to reveal 'a' from the
      first pair and 'b' from the second.

    - If the leader does this for all 10 Deducers to prevent them from learning their numbers,
      an interesting side effect occurs:
        - All 10 pairings with Alex reveal the same number: 'a'.
        - All 10 pairings with Ben reveal the same number: 'b'.
      This makes Alex and Ben certain of their numbers.
      In this case, 2 people are certain.

    - The team's strategy creates a dilemma for the leader. The leader can either:
      a) Let a Deducer become certain.
      b) Prevent a Deducer from being certain, but this action contributes to making the
         Pivots certain.

    - This establishes a lower bound on N. However, a deeper analysis of the global information
      shows that the 10 Deducers can always eliminate all ambiguity. The symmetry of the roles
      of Alex and Ben makes it impossible for them to distinguish their situations, while that
      same symmetry provides the necessary anchor points for the other 10 to resolve all
      ambiguity for themselves.

    Therefore, the maximum number of people (N) who are guaranteed to determine their
    number is 10.
