# Step 1: Decode the numbers from each line of the haiku.
# "An August tempest" -> August is the 8th month.
num1 = 8
# "Twice fifteen brings winds of change" -> 2 * 15.
num2 = 2 * 15
# "A divine one yields" -> "A" and "one" point to 1.
num3 = 1

# Step 2: The phrasing "brings winds of change" and "yields" suggests subtraction from the largest number.
# We formulate the equation based on this interpretation.
result = num2 - num1 - num3

# Step 3: Convert the numerical result to the corresponding letter of the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.).
# We can use the ASCII value of 'A' (65) as a base. Since we want A=1, we need to add 'result - 1'.
# For example, for result=1, 65 + 1 - 1 = 65 ('A'). For result=2, 65 + 2 - 1 = 66 ('B').
final_answer_letter = chr(65 + result - 1)

# Step 4: Print the derived equation and the final answer as requested.
print("The riddle suggests the following equation:")
print(f"{num2} - {num1} - {num3} = {result}")
print(f"The answer is the {result}st letter of the alphabet.")
