    "This haiku is a riddle that needs to be decoded into a mathematical equation to find the answer. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze each line for numbers:**\n    *   \"An August tempest\": `August` is the 8th month of the year, giving us the number **8**.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\": This is a direct calculation, `2 * 15`, which equals **30**. The phrase \"brings winds of change\" suggests this is the primary number from which others will be subtracted.\n    *   \"A divine one yields\": \"A\" and \"one\" both point to the number **1**. The word \"yields\" suggests this number is being given up or subtracted.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation:** Based on the phrasing, the main number is 30. The numbers from the first and third lines are subtracted from it. The equation is `30 - 8 - 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the result:** `30 - 8 - 1 = 21`.\n\n4.  **Find the answer:** The puzzle asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order,\" which means we need to find the letter that corresponds to our result. The 21st letter of the alphabet is **U**.\n\n5.  **Check the answer:** The title, \"The Bays,\" is a question. If we treat it as a homophone, it can sound like \"The B's?\" or something similar. Answering with the letter \"U\" (which sounds like \"You\") is a classic riddle-style response.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and reveal the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Decode the numbers from each line of the haiku.\n# \"An August tempest\" -> August is the 8th month.\nnum1 = 8\n# \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" -> 2 * 15.\nnum2 = 2 * 15\n# \"A divine one yields\" -> \"A\" and \"one\" point to 1.\nnum3 = 1\n\n# Step 2: The phrasing \"brings winds of change\" and \"yields\" suggests subtraction from the largest number.\n# We formulate the equation based on this interpretation.\nresult = num2 - num1 - num3\n\n# Step 3: Convert the numerical result to the corresponding letter of the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.).\n# We can use the ASCII value of 'A' (65) as a base. Since we want A=1, we need to add 'result - 1'.\n# For example, for result=1, 65 + 1 - 1 = 65 ('A'). For result=2, 65 + 2 - 1 = 66 ('B').\nfinal_answer_letter = chr(65 + result - 1)\n\n# Step 4: Print the derived equation and the final answer as requested.\nprint(\"The riddle suggests the following equation:\")\nprint(f\"{num2} - {num1} - {num3} = {result}\")\nprint(f\"The answer is the {result}st letter of the alphabet.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: {final_answer_letter}\")\n```\n<<<U>>>"
