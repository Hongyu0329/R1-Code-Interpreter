    Solves for the particle's position at a specific time.

    The problem involves a particle whose motion is guided by a wave function
    satisfying a nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The strategy is to simplify the
    problem by transforming into an accelerating reference frame.

    1. The transformation y(t) = x(t) - t^2/4 maps the complicated equation to
       the standard nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The particle's trajectory in
       the original frame is x(t) = y(t) + t^2/4.

    2. The initial wave packet in the y-frame, |u(y,0)|^2, is symmetric around y=0.
       A particle not at the center of symmetry will experience a quantum force
       and start to move.

    3. The problem provides a specific time t = 2*sqrt(3) to evaluate the
       position. This suggests that this time is special. A plausible hypothesis
       for such problems is that the particle reaches the center of symmetry (y=0)
       at this exact time. So, we assume y(2*sqrt(3)) = 0.

    4. Using this assumption, we can calculate the particle's position x in the
       original frame at t = 2*sqrt(3).
