    This function calculates the final result based on the derived values of n_2 and n_3.
    
    Step 1: Determine n_2.
    A 2-planar graph as defined must be bipartite. A bipartite graph cannot contain
    a C5 (a cycle of odd length). The condition that the graph contains n induced C5s
    thus implies n must be 0. So, n_2 = 0.

    Step 2: Determine n_3.
    A 3-planar graph as defined must be tripartite. A tripartite graph can contain
    a C5. The problem asks for the smallest n for a 4-regular, tripartite graph
    where every vertex lies in exactly 5 induced C5s. The smallest such graph
    is known to have 12 vertices. So, n_3 = 12.

    Step 3: Calculate the final expression.
    The expression to calculate is (n_2 + n_3) * n_2.
