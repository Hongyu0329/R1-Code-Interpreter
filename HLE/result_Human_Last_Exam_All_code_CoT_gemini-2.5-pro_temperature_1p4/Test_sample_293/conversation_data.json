    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will simplify the integrand, which is an infinite sum of logarithms. The sum of logarithms can be converted into the logarithm of a product:\n    $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\n2.  Next, I'll use the well-known trigonometric identity for the product of cosines:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{N}\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin x}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)} $$\n3.  By taking the limit as $N \\to \\infty$, I'll show that this product simplifies to $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$.\n4.  With this simplification, the original problem reduces to evaluating the definite integral:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n5.  This is a standard but non-trivial integral. Instead of deriving the result from scratch using complex analysis, which is highly complex, I will use Python's symbolic math library, `sympy`, to compute its exact value. This is a practical application of coding skills to solve an advanced mathematical problem.\n6.  Finally, the Python code will print out the resulting equation and its numerical value, breaking down the components of the final answer as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral by first simplifying the integrand\n    and then using symbolic computation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The integral to be evaluated is:\n    # I = integral from 0 to infinity of sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)) dx\n    #\n    # Step 1: Rewrite the sum of logarithms as the logarithm of a product.\n    # The sum can be written as: log(product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n))\n    #\n    # Step 2: Use the identity for the finite product of cosines:\n    # product_{k=1 to N} cos(x/2^k) = sin(x) / (2^N * sin(x/2^N))\n    #\n    # Step 3: Take the limit as N approaches infinity.\n    # As N -> infinity, the term x/2^N approaches 0. For a small angle u, sin(u) is approximately u.\n    # So, sin(x/2^N) can be approximated by x/2^N.\n    # The denominator 2^N * sin(x/2^N) becomes 2^N * (x/2^N) = x.\n    # Therefore, the infinite product is: product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) = sin(x) / x.\n    #\n    # Step 4: Substitute this result back into the integral.\n    # The problem reduces to evaluating the integral:\n    # I = integral from 0 to infinity of log(sin(x)/x) dx.\n    #\n    # Step 5: Evaluate the integral using symbolic mathematics.\n    # This is a known definite integral.
