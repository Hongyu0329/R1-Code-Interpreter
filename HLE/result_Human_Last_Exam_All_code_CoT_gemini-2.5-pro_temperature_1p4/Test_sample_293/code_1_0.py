    # The integral to be evaluated is:
    # I = integral from 0 to infinity of sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)) dx
    #
    # Step 1: Rewrite the sum of logarithms as the logarithm of a product.
    # The sum can be written as: log(product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n))
    #
    # Step 2: Use the identity for the finite product of cosines:
    # product_{k=1 to N} cos(x/2^k) = sin(x) / (2^N * sin(x/2^N))
    #
    # Step 3: Take the limit as N approaches infinity.
    # As N -> infinity, the term x/2^N approaches 0. For a small angle u, sin(u) is approximately u.
    # So, sin(x/2^N) can be approximated by x/2^N.
    # The denominator 2^N * sin(x/2^N) becomes 2^N * (x/2^N) = x.
    # Therefore, the infinite product is: product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) = sin(x) / x.
    #
    # Step 4: Substitute this result back into the integral.
    # The problem reduces to evaluating the integral:
    # I = integral from 0 to infinity of log(sin(x)/x) dx.
    #
    # Step 5: Evaluate the integral using symbolic mathematics.
    # This is a known definite integral. We will use the 'sympy' library to compute it.
