    Identifies and prints the homotopy-theoretic obstructions for two paths
    of bundle automorphisms to be homotopic relative to their endpoints.

    The problem asks for the obstructions to a homotopy between two paths, phi_t and psi_t,
    in the space of automorphisms of a vector bundle E over Sigma(X). Both paths connect
    the identity to the negative identity. This is equivalent to determining when the loop
    delta_t = psi_t * (phi_t)^(-1) is homotopically trivial. The homotopy class of this loop
    is an element of pi_1(Aut(E)). The obstructions are therefore the groups that classify
    this homotopy class, which are the composition factors of pi_1(Aut(E)).

    Using standard techniques in algebraic topology (fibration sequences and spectral sequences),
    one can show that this group is built from the following homotopy and cohomology groups.
    The parameter 'n' comes from X being a homology (n-1)-sphere, and '2k' is the rank of the
    vector bundle E.
