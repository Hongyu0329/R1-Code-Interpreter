def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder
    of X \ {x}, where X is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.
    
    The steps are as follows:
    1. The remainder is a separable continuum.
    2. A separable continuum can be either decomposable (1 composant) or indecomposable (c composants).
       'c' is the cardinality of the continuum, 2^{\aleph_0}.
    3. The maximum possible number of composants is therefore 'c', provided an example exists where
       the remainder is indecomposable.
    4. For the pseudo-arc (a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum), the remainder is also
       a pseudo-arc, which is indecomposable.
    5. Thus, the number of composants can be 'c', making it the maximum possible value.
    
    The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation. As the answer is a cardinal number
    'c', not a finite integer, we will represent it as a string.
