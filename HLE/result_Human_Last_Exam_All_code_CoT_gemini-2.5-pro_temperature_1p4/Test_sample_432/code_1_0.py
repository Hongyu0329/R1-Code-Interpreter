# The problem requires identifying which of the given sets have the same cardinality as the interval [0,1].
# The cardinality of [0,1] is the cardinality of the continuum, c, which is equal to 2^aleph_0.
# Based on set theory principles, the following sets have cardinality c:
# A. (0, 1) - An open interval has cardinality c.
# D. R (Real numbers) - Has cardinality c by definition.
# E. R \ Q (Irrational numbers) - Has cardinality c.
# F. C (Complex numbers) - Equivalent to R^2, has cardinality c^2 = c.
# G. H (Quaternions) - Equivalent to R^4, has cardinality c^4 = c.
# H. {x: c'(x) = 0} for the Cantor function - A countable union of open intervals, has cardinality c.
# J. Set of points in an infinite dimensional space (R^N) - Has cardinality c^(aleph_0) = c.
# K. Set of lattice points in an infinite dimensional space (Z^N) - Has cardinality (aleph_0)^(aleph_0) = c.
# M. R x R - Has cardinality c*c = c.
# N. 2^N - The power set of a countable set has cardinality 2^aleph_0 = c.
# O. 2^Q - The power set of a countable set has cardinality 2^aleph_0 = c.
#
# The other sets have different cardinalities:
# B, C, I, L have cardinality aleph_0.
# P, Q have cardinality 2^c.
#
# Combining the correct letters and sorting them alphabetically gives the final answer.
