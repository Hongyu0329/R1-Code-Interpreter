The final expression for the integral is the matrix $I = \mu_0 \log(1-\Gamma) (\mathbf{R}-\mu_0\mathbf{I})^{-1}$.
The eigenvalues of this matrix are given by the formula $\lambda_r = \frac{\mu_0 \log(1-\Gamma)}{\gamma_r-\mu_0}$, each with multiplicity $K_r$. The Python script calculates these eigenvalues based on the provided inputs.
