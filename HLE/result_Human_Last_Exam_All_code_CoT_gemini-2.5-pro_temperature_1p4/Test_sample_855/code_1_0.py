# This code simulates the thinking process for solving the Pandora landing problem
# using the Titan computer architecture. The final conclusion is determined by whether
# the necessary calculations are possible under the given constraints.

# Step 1 & 2: Define the physics and simplify the model
# The total force required from the rocket is the sum of the gravitational
# force and the force needed for deceleration.
# F_rocket = F_g + F_decel

# Deceleration force calculation
m = 50  # kg
v_i = 300  # m/s
h = 5000  # m
# From kinematics (v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad), the required acceleration is a = v_i^2 / (2h)
a_decel = v_i**2 / (2 * h)
F_decel = m * a_decel  # This calculates to 50 * 9 = 450 N

# Gravitational force calculation (simplified model)
# We simplify Pandora to a uniform sphere, ignoring the negligible core and bulge.
R_pandora = 2000 * 1000  # meters
rho_shell = 300  # kg/m^3
G = 6.674e-11
PI = math.pi
# g = (4/3) * pi * G * R * rho
g_pandora = (4 / 3) * PI * G * R_pandora * rho_shell
F_g = m * g_pandora # This calculates to approx 8.4 N

F_total = F_g + F_decel

# Step 3 & 4: Analyze feasibility on Titan architecture

# The main constraint: numerators and denominators of fractions, and intermediate
# products, must not exceed 31 (5-bit unsigned integer limit).

# Analysis of F_decel = 50 * 9
# To compute this, we must represent 50 and 9 and multiply them.
# 50 cannot be a 5-bit integer. It could be represented as a product, e.g., (25/1) * (2/1).
# 9 can be represented as (9/1).
# The multiplication is (25/1) * (2/1) * (9/1).
# Let's try to perform this step-by-step as Titan would.
# Operation 1: (2/1) * (9/1). Result numerator is 2*9=18. Denominator is 1*1=1.
# Result is (18/1). Both are <= 31, so this step is valid.
# Operation 2: (18/1) * (25/1). Result numerator is 18*25=450.
# 450 is much larger than 31. This operation is invalid.

# Let's try reordering:
# Operation 1: (25/1) * (9/1). Result numerator is 25*9=225.
# 225 > 31. This operation is invalid from the start.

# The example calculation `13/1 * 6/5 -> 25/2 * 6/5` relies on introducing
# factors that can be cancelled BEFORE multiplication. The prime factors of 50 are 2, 5, 5.
# The prime factors of 9 are 3, 3. There are no common factors to cancel.
# Approximating the numbers could introduce factors, but the values 50 and 9 are exact.

# A similar issue arises when calculating F_g.
# It requires multiplying (4/3) by a fraction for pi, e.g., (22/7).
# The numerator would be 4 * 22 = 88, which is > 31. This very first step fails.

# Step 5: Conclusion
# Since essential and non-negligible parts of the calculation (both F_decel and F_g)
# involve multiplication that results in intermediate numerators exceeding the 31 limit,
# and no simplification through cancellation is possible, the Titan computer
# cannot perform the calculation.

# Therefore, the answer is that the force cannot be calculated.
final_answer = "N0"

# Final result of the analysis
# The final result is not a number, but a conclusion about feasibility.
