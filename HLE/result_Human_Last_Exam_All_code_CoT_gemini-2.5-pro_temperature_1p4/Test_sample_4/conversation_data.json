    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will determine the dimensions of its cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$, which are known as the Betti numbers $b_k$. The Poincaré polynomial is then given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the Lie algebra.**\n    The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ has a semidirect product structure $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{h}$, where $\\mathbb{R}$ is the one-dimensional algebra spanned by $e_1$, and $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ is given by the adjoint representation, $\\text{ad}_{e_1}$.\n\n2.  **Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.**\n    For a Lie algebra extension $0 \\to \\mathfrak{h} \\to \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{k} \\to 0$, there is a spectral sequence converging to the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$. In our case, $\\mathfrak{h}$ is abelian and $\\mathfrak{k} = \\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{h} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The spectral sequence argument simplifies the computation of the Betti numbers $b_k(\\mathfrak{g})$. The result is that the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is related to the kernel of the derivation $\\delta$ acting on the exterior algebra of $\\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\\delta$ is induced by the action of $e_1$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Poincaré polynomial.**\n    The relation is given by the formula:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) K(x)$,\n    where $K(x) = \\sum_{q=0}^{5} k_q x^q$, and $k_q = \\dim(\\ker(\\delta: \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{h}^*) \\to \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{h}^*)))$.\n\n4.  **Define the derivation $\\delta$.**\n    The action of $\\text{ad}_{e_1}$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ is given by:\n    $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_2) = e_3$, $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_3) = e_4$, $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_5) = e_6$.\n    The induced action $\\delta$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{h}^* = \\text{span}\\{e_2^*, \\dots, e_6^*\\}$ is given by the negative transpose of this action:\n    $\\delta(e_2^*) = -e_3^*$, $\\delta(e_3^*) = -e_4^*$, $\\delta(e_4^*) = 0$, $\\delta(e_5^*) = -e_6^*$, $\\delta(e_6^*) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Compute the dimensions of the kernels ($k_q$).**\n    We will programmatically construct the matrix representation of the linear operator $\\delta$ acting on each exterior power $\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ for $q = 0, \\ldots, 5$. The dimension of the kernel, $k_q$, is then computed as the dimension of the space minus the rank of the matrix.\n\n6.  **Assemble the final polynomial.**\n    Using the computed values of $k_q$, we will construct $K(x)$ and then $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$. The code will then print the final polynomial term-by-term.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef get_kernel_dims():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimensions of the kernel of the derivation delta on each Lambda^q(h*).\n    The derivation delta acts on the basis {e2*, e3*, e4*, e5*, e6*} as follows:\n    delta(e2*) = -e3*\n    delta(e3*) = -e4*\n    delta(e4*) = 0\n    delta(e5*) = -e6*\n    delta(e6*) = 0\n    \n    We represent the basis {e2*, e3*, e4*, e5*, e6*} by indices {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Adjacency list representation of the derivation on basis elements\n    # index i maps to delta_map[i]\n    # e.g., e2* -> -e3* is 0 -> {1: -1.0}\n    delta_map = {\n        0: {1: -1.0},\n        1: {2: -1.0},\n        2: {},\n        3: {4: -1.0},\n        4: {},\n    }\n    num_vars = 5\n    kernel_dims = []\n\n    for q in range(num_vars + 1):\n        if q == 0:\n            kernel_dims.append(1) # Ker(delta) on Lambda^0 is span(1)\n            continue\n            \n        # Generate basis for Lambda^q(h*)\n        # Basis elements are sorted tuples of indices\n        basis = sorted(list(combinations(range(num_vars), q)))\n        dim_lambda_q = len(basis)\n        \n        # Matrix representation of delta on Lambda^q(h*)\n        matrix = np.zeros((dim_lambda_q, dim_lambda_q))\n        \n        # Map basis elements (tuples) to their index in the matrix\n        basis_to_idx = {b: i for i, b in enumerate(basis)}\n\n        for i, b_in in enumerate(basis):\n            # Apply delta to the basis element b_in\n            # delta(e_i1 ^ ... ^ e_iq) = sum_{j=1 to q} e_i1 ^ ... ^ delta(e_ij) ^ ... ^ e_iq\n            image = {} # Store the resulting combination of basis vectors\n            for j in range(q):\n                original_vec_idx = b_in[j]\n                \n                # For each component in the image of delta(e_{original_vec_idx})\n                for term_idx, coeff in delta_map[original_vec_idx].items():\n                    # Create the new wedge product\n                    new_b = list(b_in)\n                    new_b[j] = term_idx\n                    \n                    # Check for zero product (repeated index)\n                    if len(set(new_b)) != q:\n                        continue\n                        \n                    # Canonical ordering (sort and find sign)\n                    perm = sorted(range(q), key=lambda k: new_b[k])\n                    sign = 1\n                    test_perm = list(perm)\n                    for k in range(q):\n                        if test_perm[k] != k:\n                            l = test_perm.index(k)\n                            test_perm[k], test_perm[l] = test_perm[l], test_perm[k]\n                            sign *= -1\n                    \n                    canonical_b = tuple(sorted(new_b))\n                    \n                    # Add to the image vector\n                    image[canonical_b] = image.get(canonical_b, 0.0) + coeff * sign\n\n            # Fill the matrix column for b_in\n            for b_out, coeff in image.items():\n                if b_out in basis_to_idx:\n                    j = basis_to_idx[b_out]\n                    matrix[j, i] = coeff\n\n        # Compute rank and nullity\n        rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)\n        nullity = dim_lambda_q -
