    # Step 3: Analyze what is required to achieve the transformation.
    # The reduction in average path length from log(n) to log(log(n)) is a
    # dramatic change. It cannot be achieved by adding a few random shortcuts.
    # It requires creating a highly organized and efficient "backbone" of long-range
    # connections within the graph.
    # Since the max degree is limited to log(n), we cannot create a single massive hub
    # that connects everything (a star graph). Instead, we must create a set of
    # multiple "hubs" (high-degree vertices) and connect them efficiently.

    # Step 4: Evaluate the given options.
    # Option A) m(n) in Theta(n log log n): Incorrect. The total number of rewirings is
    # bounded by O(n) because each node can only donate 3 edges (from degree 6 to 3),
    # so the total degree to be moved is at most 3n.
    
    # Option B) m(n) in Theta(n): Plausible. A fundamental change to a graph of size n
    # is expected to require Theta(n) edge modifications.
    
    # Option C) The rewired edges must form a tree-like structure among high-degree vertices:
    # This is the most insightful description of the required structure. To achieve the
    # log(log(n)) path length, the hubs can't be connected randomly (which would create
    # a new log(H) problem where H is the number of hubs). They must be connected in a
    # highly efficient, structured way, such as a hierarchy. A "tree-like" structure
    # is an excellent description of such an efficient, sparse backbone. This statement
    # describes the necessary mechanism for the transformation.
    
    # Option D) At least n/4 vertices must reach degree ceil(log(n)): Incorrect. The total
    # degree sum is 2 * E = 6n. The degree sum of these nodes alone would be
    # (n/4) * log(n), which is much larger than 6n for large n.
    
    # Option F) The resulting graph must have power-law degree distribution: Incorrect.
    # A power-law distribution is characterized by a "fat tail" of arbitrarily high-degree
    # nodes, which is prevented by the max_degree <= log(n) constraint.

    # Option H) The process requires at least n/6 edge removals: This is plausible and
    # consistent with B. For instance, creating n/log(n) hubs of degree log(n)
    # would require roughly n/2 rewirings, which is greater than n/6. However, proving
    # this specific constant 1/6 is difficult, making it a "riskier" choice than C.
    
    # Other options are either clearly false (I, K) or less central than C.

    # Step 5: Conclude.
    # Option C provides the most fundamental insight into the solution. The transformation
    # is only possible if a specific structure is created. The cost (m(n)) is a
    # consequence of the need to build this structure. Therefore, C is the best answer
    # as it describes the core mechanism.
    
    # The problem asks for output with numbers from an equation. We will reference numbers
    # from the most relevant quantitative statement, H.
    explanation = f"""
The core of the problem is the transformation from a small-world network (L~log(n)) to an ultra-small-world network (L~log(log(n))) under a strict degree constraint (max_degree <= log(n)). This cannot be done with random shortcuts; it requires an organized, hierarchical structure.

The rewired edges must be used to create an efficient backbone connecting high-degree vertices (hubs). A "tree-like structure" among these hubs provides the necessary hierarchy of shortcuts to reduce the average path length to log(log(n)). This makes statement C a necessary condition for the transformation.

Other statements, like B (m(n) in Theta(n)) and H (m(n) >= n/6), describe the cost. Building the required structure in C necessitates a large number of rewirings, making B and H consequences of C. While likely true, they don't explain the underlying mechanism. Statement H contains the numbers n and 6, as specified by the prompt 'output each number in the final equation'. The equation-like statement is: m(n) >= n / 6.

Considering all options, C is the most fundamental correct statement about the required network topology.
