    # Step 1: Define the reactants and the reaction type.

    # A disilirane adds across a double bond on the fullerene surface.

    The reaction involves adding a disilirane molecule to the outer surface of the Ce2@C80 fullerene cage. This is an external modification and does not involve direct interaction with the cerium atoms inside.
    """

    # Step 2: Describe the initial state of the cerium atoms.
    # Inside the cage, cerium atoms exist as positive ions (Ce3+) within the negatively charged fullerene cage (C80^6-).
    explanation_part2 = """
    Before the reaction, the two cerium atoms, existing as positively charged Ce³⁺ ions, are trapped inside the negatively charged C80 cage. In a perfectly symmetric cage, they would have some degree of mobility.

    # Step 3: Explain the effect of the external addition on the cage and the internal environment.
    # The addition breaks the symmetry of the cage and creates a unique electrostatic site.
    explanation_part3 = """
    The addition of the bulky disilirane group to the outside of the cage breaks the cage's symmetry. It creates a localized region with different electronic properties and geometry. This region acts as a point of strong electrostatic attraction for the positive ions inside.

    explanation_part4 = """
    The location on the fullerene where the external group attaches is defined as a 'pole'. The positively charged cerium ions are drawn to this pole to minimize their potential energy, causing them to become localized at this position. Therefore, the cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene.
