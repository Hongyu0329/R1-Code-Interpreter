# The problem asks for the number of different homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with a given set of properties.

# Step-by-step reasoning leads to the conclusion that the space X must be
# homeomorphic to the real line R.
# 1. The properties of X (metric, locally compact, continuous bijective image of R)
#    imply that X is a connected 1-manifold.
# 2. Connected 1-manifolds are homeomorphic to either the real line (R) or the circle (S^1).
# 3. A continuous bijection from R to S^1 is impossible, ruling out the circle.
# 4. The real line R itself satisfies all the given properties.
#
# Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.

number_of_classes = 1

# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes. Our analysis shows there is only one.
