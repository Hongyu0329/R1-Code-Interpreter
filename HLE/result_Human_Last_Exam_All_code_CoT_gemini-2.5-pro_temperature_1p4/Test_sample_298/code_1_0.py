    # The user is asking for the cohomology groups of M(k) for k=7.
    # M(k) is the moduli space of k disjoint linearly embedded closed intervals in R^2.

    # Step 1: Identify the homotopy type of M(k).
    # According to results in algebraic topology (e.g., by An and Chae), the space M(k)
    # is homotopy equivalent to the configuration space of k disjoint lines in R^2.
    # Let L be the space of all lines in R^2. M(k) is homotopy equivalent to C(L, k),
    # the unordered configuration space of k points in L.
    # M(k) ~ C(L, k)

    # Step 2: Identify the homotopy type of the space of lines L.
    # The space of lines in R^2, L, is topologically an open Mobius strip.
    # The open Mobius strip is homotopy equivalent to its core circle, S^1.
    # L ~ S^1
    # Therefore, M(k) ~ C(S^1, k).

    # Step 3: Identify the homotopy type of C(S^1, k).
    # It is a classical result in topology that the configuration space of k
    # unordered points on a circle, C(S^1, k), is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1
    # for any k >= 1.
    # C(S^1, k) ~ S^1

    # Step 4: Conclusion for M(7).
    # Combining these steps, we find that for any k >= 1, M(k) ~ S^1.
    # This means M(7) has the same cohomology as a circle.
    k = 7 # The result is independent of k for k >= 1.

    # Step 5: Determine the cohomology groups of S^1.
    # The integral cohomology groups H^i(S^1; Z) are well-known:
    # H^0(S^1; Z) = Z, because S^1 is path-connected.
    # H^1(S^1; Z) = Z.
    # H^i(S^1; Z) = 0 for i >= 2.
    # The largest integer 'a' for which H^a is non-zero is a=1.

    # Step 6: Format the output as requested.
    # H^0(M(7)) is Z.
    # H^1(M(7)) is Z.
    # The list is [H^0, H^1].
    
    H0 = "Z"
    H1 = "Z"
    
    # The problem asks for the list [H^0(M(7)), H^1(M(7)), ..., H^a(M(7))]
    # where a is the largest integer with a non-zero group. Here a=1.
    cohomology_groups = [H0, H1]

    # The final output should be a string in the format '[G0, G1, ...]'
