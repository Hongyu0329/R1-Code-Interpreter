    # --- Step 1: Analyze the rotation group A4 ---
    print("1. The 3D object A has a rotation group equal to A4.")
    print("   A4 is the group of rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron.")
    print("   A4 contains rotation axes of order 2 and 3.\n")

    # --- Step 2: Principle of Projections ---
    print("2. A symmetry in the 2D projection B must be caused by a symmetry in the 3D object A.")
    print("   The problem specifies the 'group of rotations' is A4, but the object's full symmetry group can be larger (e.g., Td or Th) by including reflections and roto-reflections.")
    print("   We must consider these cases because the object A is 'arbitrary'.\n")

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate each possible order ---

    # i) Possibility of order 3
    print("--- Analysis for Order 3 ---")
    print("An object with A4 symmetry has 3-fold rotation axes.")
    print("If we project the object along a 3-fold rotation axis, the projection will have 3-fold (C3) rotational symmetry.")
    print("The order of the C3 group is 3.")
    print("Conclusion: Order 3 is possible.\n")

    # ii) Possibility of order 4
    print("--- Analysis for Order 4 ---")
    print("Consider an object A with the full symmetry of a regular tetrahedron (group Td). Its rotation group is A4.")
    print("The Td group contains 4-fold roto-reflection axes (S4). These axes are also 2-fold rotation axes for A4.")
    print("A 4-fold roto-reflection (S4) is a rotation by 360/4 = 90 degrees, followed by a reflection.")
    print("When projecting along this axis, the rotational component is preserved, resulting in a 90-degree rotation symmetry in the projection.")
    print("This gives the projection a 4-fold (C4) rotational symmetry.")
    print("The order of the C4 group is 4.")
    print("Conclusion: Order 4 is possible.\n")

    # iii) Possibility of order 6
    print("--- Analysis for Order 6 ---")
    print("Consider an object A with pyritohedral symmetry (group Th). Its rotation group is A4.")
    print("The Th group contains 6-fold roto-reflection axes (S6). These axes are also 3-fold rotation axes for A4.")
    print("An S6 operation is a rotation by 360/6 = 60 degrees, followed by a reflection.")
    print("When projecting along this axis, the projection gains a 60-degree rotational symmetry.")
    print("This gives the projection a 6-fold (C6) rotational symmetry.")
    print("The order of the C6 group is 6.")
    print("Conclusion: Order 6 is possible.\n")

    # iv) Possibility of order Infinity
    print("--- Analysis for Order Infinity ---")
    print("A projection with infinite rotational symmetry must be a circle (or disk).")
    print("This requires the original 3D object A to be an object of revolution (i.e., possess continuous rotational symmetry about an axis).")
    print("If an object has continuous rotational symmetry, its rotation group would be infinite.")
    print("This contradicts the given fact that the object's rotation group is A4, which is finite (order 12).")
    print("Conclusion: Order Infinity is not possible.\n")

    # --- Step 4: Final Conclusion ---
    print("=" * 50)
    print("Summary:")
    print("The possible orders from the list {3, 4, 6, Infinity} are 3, 4, and 6.")
    print("This corresponds to the set [i, ii, iii].")
    print("Looking at the answer choices, this set matches option L.")
