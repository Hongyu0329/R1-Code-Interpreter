def get_rank_of_torsion_subgroup(torsion_coeffs):
    """
    Calculates the rank of a torsion group given by its cyclic factors.
    
    An abelian torsion group T can be written as a direct sum of finite cyclic groups:
    T = Z_n1 + Z_n2 + ... + Z_nk
    
    The rank of an abelian group A is defined as the dimension of the 
    Q-vector space obtained by taking the tensor product of A with the field of 
    rational numbers Q. This is expressed as rank(A) = dim_Q(A (tensor) Q).
    
    For any element t in a torsion group T, there exists a positive integer m
    such that m*t = 0 (the identity element).
    
    In the tensor product T (tensor) Q, any element t (tensor) q can be written as:
    t (tensor) q = t (tensor) (m * q/m) = (m*t) (tensor) (q/m) = 0 (tensor) (q/m) = 0.
    
    This shows that every element in T (tensor) Q is zero. Thus, T (tensor) Q is the 
    zero vector space. The dimension of the zero vector space is 0.
    
    Therefore, the rank of any torsion group is 0.

    Args:
        torsion_coeffs: A list of integers [n1, n2, ...] representing the
                        orders of the cyclic components of the torsion group.
                        This argument is purely illustrative, as the result is
                        independent of the specific structure.

    Returns:
        The rank of the torsion group.
