    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Find the Market Equilibrium:** The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_E`) and the prices are equal. We will find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`) by setting the supply and demand price functions equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    This equation is complex and requires a numerical solver to find the value of `Q_E`.\n\n2.  **Determine Integration Bounds:** The supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` is only defined when `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. This value is the minimum quantity (`Q_min`) for which supply exists. The demand function is defined for all `Q >= 0`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand curve and the supply curve.\n    *   Consumer Surplus is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price (`P_E`), from `Q=0` to `Q=Q_E`.\n    *   Producer Surplus is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price (`P_E`), from the minimum supply quantity (`Q_min`) to `Q=Q_E`.\n    *   Total Welfare (`TW`) is the area under the demand curve from `0` to `Q_E` minus the area under the supply curve from `Q_min` to `Q_E`.\n    *   `TW = ∫[0 to Q_E] (P_Demand(Q)) dQ - ∫[Q_min to Q_E] (P_Supply(Q)) dQ`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will use Python with the `scipy` library to perform the numerical calculations:\n    *   `scipy.optimize.fsolve` to find the equilibrium quantity `Q_E`.\n    *   `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the definite integrals for the areas under the curves.\n    *   Finally, subtract the area under the supply curve from the area under the demand curve to get the total welfare.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the supply and demand functions\ndef demand_p(q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates price based on demand quantity.\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\ndef supply_p(q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates price based on supply quantity.\"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is valid for the natural logarithm\n    q_safe = np.asarray(q)\n    if np.any(q_safe**3 - 2 <= 0):\n        # Return a large number for out-of-domain values to guide the solver\n        return np.inf \n    return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n# Define the equation to find the equilibrium point (Supply Price - Demand Price = 0)\ndef equilibrium_equation(q):\n    \"\"\"Difference between supply and demand prices.
