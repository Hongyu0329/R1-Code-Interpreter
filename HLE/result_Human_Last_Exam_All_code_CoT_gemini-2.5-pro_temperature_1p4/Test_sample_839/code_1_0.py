The core of the question is to identify the mechanism that allows an energetically unfavorable reaction (sulphate-reducing ammonium oxidation) to occur when ammonium sulfate aerosols dissolve. This suggests a catalytic process is taking place, which lowers the reaction's energy barrier.

Here is a breakdown of why option E is the most accurate explanation:

1.  **The Environment:** An aerosol particle has an extremely high surface-area-to-volume ratio. The chemistry at the interface between the highly concentrated salt solution and the air is very different from that in a bulk (dilute) solution.

2.  **Altered Surface Ion Pairing:** In the solid crystal, ions are locked in a rigid lattice. In a dilute solution, they are fully separated and solvated by water. At the unique interface of a dissolving aerosol, ammonium (NH₄⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions are close together but have some mobility. This allows them to form specific arrangements, or "ion pairs," that are different from their configuration in either the solid or bulk liquid phase.

3.  **Formation of Transient Complexes to Lower the Energy Barrier:** These specific surface ion pairings can act as temporary "transient complexes." By bringing the ammonium and sulfate ions into a specific orientation, this complex stabilizes the transition state of the redox reaction. Stabilizing the transition state is equivalent to lowering the overall activation energy, or "reaction energy barrier." This new, lower-energy pathway allows the electron transfer from ammonium to sulfate to happen without the external energy input it would normally require.

In summary, the aerosol surface acts as a catalyst. Option E, "It alters surface ion pairing, forming transient complexes that lower the reaction energy barrier," provides the most precise and accurate description of this catalytic mechanism.
