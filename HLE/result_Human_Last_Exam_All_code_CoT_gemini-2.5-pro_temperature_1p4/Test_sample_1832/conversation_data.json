    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we need to analyze the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The geometry of spacetime outside a non-rotating, uncharged, spherically symmetric body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n2.  **Define Coordinates:** We will use standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n3.  **Christoffel Symbol Formula:** The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ are calculated from the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its derivatives using the formula:\n    $$ \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right) $$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n4.  **Symbolic Calculation:** Since the manual calculation is tedious and prone to errors, I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic computation. The script will:\n    *   Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   Calculate its inverse $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$.\n    *   Compute the necessary partial derivatives of the metric components.\n    *   Iterate through all possible indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ to calculate each of the $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ Christoffel symbols.\n    *   Simplify the resulting expression for each symbol and check if it is non-zero.\n    *   Print each non-zero symbol with its value and indices.\n    *   Finally, print the total count of non-zero symbols.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef count_schwarzschild_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the\n    Schwarzschild metric using symbolic mathematics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define symbolic coordinates and constants.\n    # We use natural units (G=c=1) for simplicity, as is standard practice.\n    # The structure (i.e., which components are non-zero) does not depend on this choice.\n    t, r, theta, phi = sp.symbols('t r theta phi')\n    M = sp.Symbol('M', positive=True) # Mass of the gravitating body\n\n    # The coordinates are x^mu = (t, r, theta, phi)\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n    coord_names = ['t', 'r', 'θ', 'φ']\n\n    # The Schwarzschild radius is r_s = 2M in natural units.\n    rs = 2 * M\n\n    # Step 2: Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor g_munu.\n    # It is a diagonal matrix.\n    g = sp.zeros(4)\n    g[0, 0] = -(1 - rs / r)\n    g[1, 1] = 1 / (1 - rs / r)\n    g[2, 2] = r**2\n    g[3, 3] = r**2 * sp.sin(theta)**2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^munu.\n    g_inv = g.inv()\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate all partial derivatives of the metric tensor.\n    # dg[k, i, j] corresponds to ∂(g_ij)/∂(x^k)\n    dg = sp.MutableDenseNDimArray.zeros(4, 4, 4)\n    for k in range(4):\n        for i in range(4):\n            for j in range(4):\n                dg[k, i, j] = sp.diff(g[i, j], coords[k])\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate each Christoffel symbol and count the non-zero ones.\n    non_zero_symbols = []\n    \n    # Iterate over all indices ρ, μ, ν from 0 to 3.\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                # The formula for Christoffel symbols:\n                # Γ^ρ_{μν} = (1/2) g^{ρσ} (∂_μ g_{νσ} + ∂_ν g_{μσ} - ∂_σ g_{μν})\n                # Summation over σ is implied.\n                gamma = sp.S(0)\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    # dg[k, i, j] = ∂g_ij/∂x^k\n                    partial_mu_g_nu_sigma = dg[mu, nu, sigma]\n                    partial_nu_g_mu_sigma = dg[nu, mu, sigma]\n                    partial_sigma_g_mu_nu = dg[sigma, mu, nu]\n                    \n                    term = g_inv[rho, sigma] * (partial_mu_g_nu_sigma + partial_nu_g_mu_sigma - partial_sigma_g_mu_nu)\n                    gamma += term\n                \n                gamma = sp.simplify(gamma / 2)\n\n                if gamma != 0:\n                    non_zero_symbols.append((rho, mu, nu, gamma))\n    \n    # Sort the results for a clean, predictable output.\n    non_zero_symbols.sort()\n\n    # Step 6: Print the results.\n    print(\"The non-zero Christoffel symbols Γ^ρ_{μν} for the Schwarzschild metric are:\")\n    print(\"Here, M is the mass of the body.
