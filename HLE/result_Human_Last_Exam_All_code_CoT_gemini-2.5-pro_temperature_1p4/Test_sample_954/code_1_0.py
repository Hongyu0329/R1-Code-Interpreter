    This function encapsulates the reasoning to determine the bounds on the number of steps
    for the described process on different classes of forests.

    The analysis shows the following:
    1.  For any forest with maximum degree at most sqrt(log n):
        The number of steps T is Theta(Delta), and Delta can be as large as Theta(sqrt(log n)).
        The bound f1(n) = Theta(sqrt(log n)) = Theta((log n)^0.5).
        This fits into category 6: 2^omega(sqrt(log log n)) but O((log n)^0.9).

    2.  For any forest with maximum degree at most log n:
        The number of steps T is Theta(Delta), and Delta can be as large as Theta(log n).
        The bound f2(n) = Theta(log n).
        This fits into category 8: Theta(log n).

    3.  For any forest:
        The number of steps T is Theta(Delta). The largest Delta achievable in a construction
        that takes Omega(Delta) steps is Delta = Theta(sqrt(n)).
        The bound f3(n) = Theta(sqrt(n)).
        This fits into category 9: omega(log n).

    Combining these results gives the three-digit number.
