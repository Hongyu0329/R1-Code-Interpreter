    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Feynman Diagrams**: First, I will identify all the unique *connected* second-order vacuum bubble diagrams for a $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory. A second-order diagram has two vertices, and since the interaction is $\\phi^4$, each vertex has four lines (or \"legs\") coming out. A vacuum bubble has no external lines, so all these legs must be connected internally to form propagators. A systematic analysis reveals there are exactly two distinct connected topologies:\n    *   **The \"Melon\" Diagram**: All four lines from the first vertex connect to the second vertex, forming four propagators between them.\n    *   **The \"Figure-8\" Diagram**: Two lines from the first vertex connect to the second vertex. The remaining two lines on the first vertex connect to each other, forming a loop. Similarly, the remaining two lines on the second vertex form another loop.\n\n2.  **Calculate Symmetry Factors**: For each of these diagrams, I will calculate its symmetry factor, denoted by $S$. The symmetry factor is the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which accounts for permutations of identical vertices and propagators that leave the diagram unchanged. I will use standard rules for this calculation:\n    *   A factor of $n!$ for any set of $n$ identical propagators connecting the same two vertices.\n    *   A factor of $2$ for any propagator that connects a vertex to itself (a loop).\n    *   A factor of $m!$ for any set of $m$ vertices that can be interchanged due to the diagram's symmetry.\n\n3.  **Sum the Factors**: Finally, I will sum the symmetry factors of all identified diagrams to get the total result.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the detailed steps, the symmetry factor for each diagram, and the final sum.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_print_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 theory and their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factors for the two connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Melon\" Diagram ---\n    # This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four identical propagators.\n    # Its symmetry factor S1 is the product of:\n    # 1.
