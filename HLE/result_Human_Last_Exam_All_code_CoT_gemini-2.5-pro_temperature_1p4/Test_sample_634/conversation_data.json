    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of the two given 2x2 polynomial matrices, P1 and P2.\n\n2.  **Method:** I will use an approach based on the Euclidean algorithm, which is a standard method for this type of problem. This involves using elementary row operations to simplify a stacked matrix.\n\n3.  **Setup:** First, I'll represent the polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using Python's `sympy` library. Then, I'll create a single 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2.\n\n4.  **Row Reduction:** I will apply a sequence of elementary row operations to the matrix `M`. These operations include swapping rows and adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another. The aim is to reduce `M` to a simpler form where the bottom two rows consist entirely of zeros.\n\n5.  **Result and Normalization:** The remaining top two non-zero rows will form a GCRD. To provide a standardized result, I will normalize this matrix by ensuring the first non-zero element in each row is 1.\n\n6.  **Implementation:** The entire process will be implemented in a Python script. The final GCRD matrix will be printed in a clear, human-readable format.\n\nHere is the code to find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    # P1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n    #       -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n    # P2 = [s, 0;\n    #       -s - 1, 1]\n\n    # Form the stacked 4x2 matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = sp.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2],\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # --- Perform Row Reduction (Euclidean Algorithm) ---\n\n    # Swap row 0 and row 2 to get a lower-degree polynomial at the top for easier pivoting.\n    M.row_swap(0, 2)\n    # M is now [[s, 0], [-s**2 - 1, s**2], [s**2 + s, -s], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n    # Use the new row 0 to create zeros in the first column of the rows below it.\n    M[1,:] = sp.simplify(M.row(1) + s * M.row(0))\n    M[2,:] = sp.simplify(M.row(2) - (s + 1) * M.row(0))\n    M[3,:] = sp.simplify(M.row(3) + 1 * M.row(0))\n    # M is now [[s, 0], [-1, s**2], [0, -s], [-1, 1]]\n\n    # Swap row 0 and row 1 to get -1 as the leading element, which is an excellent pivot.\n    M.row_swap(0, 1)\n    # M is now [[-1, s**2], [s, 0], [0, -s], [-1, 1]]\n\n    # Use the new row 0 to eliminate the first element in other rows.\n    M[1,:] = sp.simplify(M.row(1) + s * M.row(0))\n    M[3,:] = sp.simplify(M.row(3) - 1 * M.row(0))\n    # M is now [[-1, s**2], [0, s**3], [0, -s], [0, 1 - s**2]]\n\n    # The first column is reduced.
