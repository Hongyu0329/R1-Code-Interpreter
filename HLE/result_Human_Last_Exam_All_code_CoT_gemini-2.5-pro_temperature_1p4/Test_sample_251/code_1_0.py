    Calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for an iterated Biran lift.
    
    The logic relies on two key facts from symplectic geometry:
    1. The base Chekanov torus in CP^2 has exactly 2 Maslov 2 disks.
    2. The Biran lift from CP^n to CP^(n+1) preserves existing Maslov 2 disks
       and creates new disks of Maslov index 2*(n+1), which for n>=2 is not 2.
