    This function evaluates seven statements about the rational closure of the cone

    seven-character string representing the correctness of each statement.
    """

    # Statement a) The quotient topology on Omega_g^rt / GL_g(Z) is Hausdorff.
    # Analysis: The action of GL_g(Z) on the boundary of Omega_g^rt (the positive
    # semi-definite matrices of rank < g) is not proper. The stabilizer of a boundary
    # point can be infinite, which implies the quotient space is not Hausdorff at that point.
    answer_a = 'N'

    # Statement b) The barycentric subdivision of the perfect cone decomposition of Omega_4^rt
    # consists only of simplicial cones.
    # Analysis: It is a general theorem in combinatorial topology that the barycentric
    # subdivision of any polyhedral complex (including a rational polyhedral cone
    # decomposition) is a simplicial complex. Thus, its cones are simplicial.
    answer_b = 'Y'

    # Statement c) For any compact set K in Omega_g^rt there exists a set of finitely many cones
    # in the second Voronoi compactification such that their union contains K.
    # Analysis: This is the definition of a locally finite decomposition. The second Voronoi
    # (or perfect cone) decomposition is known to be a locally finite fan.
    answer_c = 'Y'

    # Statement d) The number of orbits of maximal cones in the perfect cone decomposition of
    # Omega_7^rt is 33.
    # Analysis: This is a known computational result by Martinet et al. in the classification
    # of perfect forms. The number of perfect form types for g=7 is indeed 33.
    number_in_statement_d = 33
    # The statement is correct as it matches the known number, 33.
    answer_d = 'Y'

    # Statement e) The GL_g(Z)-stabilizer of a cone sigma in the central cone decomposition
    # is finite if sigma intersects Omega_g.
    # Analysis: If a cone sigma intersects the interior Omega_g, it must be a full-dimensional
    # cone. Its stabilizer permutes the finite set of its extreme rays. Since these rays
    # span the entire space, this permutation determines the stabilizer element uniquely,
    # leading to a finite stabilizer group.
    answer_e = 'Y'

    # Statement f) The number of orbits of cones in the Second Voronoi decomposition of Omega_5^rt is 222.
    # Analysis: According to recent sources (e.g., the paper by Elbaz-Vincent, Gangl, and SoulÃ©
    # and the OEIS sequence A129035), the total number of orbits of cones of all dimensions
    # for g=5 is 225.
    number_in_statement_f = 222
    correct_number = 225
    # The number 222 in the statement is incorrect (225 is correct).
    answer_f = 'N'

    # Statement g) Given cones tau, sigma in the perfect cone decomposition with tau a face of sigma,
    # one has that their corresponding groups of GL_g(Z)-stabilizers satisfy Stab(tau) subset Stab(sigma).
    # Analysis: This is false. The stabilizer of a face is generally larger than the stabilizer of the
    # cone. For example, a face on the boundary may have an infinite stabilizer, while the
    # full-dimensional cone has a finite one.
