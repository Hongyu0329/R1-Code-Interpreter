    "The earliest known recorded date in the Americas comes from the Zapotec civilization, pre-dating the more famous Maya Long Count calendar dates. The evidence is found on a stone monument at an archaeological site in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Store the key information about this date: the civilization, the site, the specific artifact, the approximate year, and a description of the glyph.\n2.  Print this information in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\ndef display_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints information about the earliest known recorded date from a\n    pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    civilization = \"Zapotec\"\n    site = \"San Jos√© Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico\"\n    artifact = \"Monument 3\"\n    date_bc = 600\n    description = \"a glyph representing the day name '1 Earthquake' from the 260-day calendar\"\n\n    print(\"--- Earliest Known Pre-Columbian Date ---\")\n    print(f\"Civilization: {civilization}\")\n    print(f\"Site: {site}\")\n    print(f\"Artifact: {artifact}\")\n    print(f\"Approximate Date: {date_bc} BC\")\n    print(f\"Description: The monument is carved with {description}.\")\n\ndisplay_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<600 BC>>>"
