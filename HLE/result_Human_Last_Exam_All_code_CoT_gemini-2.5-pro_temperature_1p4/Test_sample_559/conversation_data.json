    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify Equilibrium Points**: I will first find the points `(d, u)` in the phase plane where `d'(t)` and `u'(t)` are both zero. These are the points where the system is at rest.\n2.  **Analyze Stability**: For each equilibrium point, I will linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian at each point will tell us about its stability (e.g., saddle point, stable node, unstable node).\n3.  **Locate the Saddle Point**: Separatrices are trajectories that act as boundaries between different regions of flow. They are often the stable and unstable manifolds connected to saddle points. I will identify the saddle point(s) from the stability analysis.\n4.  **Find the Separatrix Equation**: I will search for a specific trajectory (an invariant manifold) that corresponds to the stable or unstable manifold of the saddle point. I will test a polynomial relationship between `d` and `u`, `d(u) = c*u^n`, and verify if it satisfies the system's equations for some constants `c` and `n`. This curve will be the separatrix.\n5.  **Present the Solution**: The Python code below will use the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations for these steps and will print the final equation of the separatrix, showing each numerical coefficient and exponent explicitly.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a system of ODEs to find its separatrix.\n    It follows these steps:\n    1.
