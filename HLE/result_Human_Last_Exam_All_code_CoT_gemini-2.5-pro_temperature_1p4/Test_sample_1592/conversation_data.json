    "My plan is to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, by calculating the geographical distance to its neighbors.\n\n1.  **Identify Neighbors**: The provinces and territories bordering Quebec are Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut.\n2.  **Find Coordinates**: I will find the latitude and longitude for Waskaganish. Then, for each neighboring province/territory, I will identify the coordinates of a point on its border that is closest to Waskaganish.\n3.  **Calculate Distances**: Using the Haversine formula, which calculates the distance between two points on a sphere (like Earth), I will compute the distance from Waskaganish to the border points of Ontario and Nunavut. New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador are significantly farther away and can be excluded from the detailed calculation.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude**: I will compare the calculated distances to find the minimum one, which will reveal the closest province or territory.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees) using the Haversine formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371\n\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    distance = R * c\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to find the closest province/territory to Waskaganish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for the Waskaganish gathering place in Quebec\n    waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon = 51.1944, -78.7583\n\n    # Coordinates for the closest points in neighboring provinces/territories\n    # New Brunswick and Newfoundland/Labrador are clearly much farther and are not included in this direct comparison.\n    locations = {\n        \"Ontario\": {\n            \"coords\": (51.1944, -79.52),  # A point on the ON/QC border directly west of Waskaganish\n            \"description\": \"the Ontario border\"\n        },\n        \"Nunavut\": {\n            \"coords\": (52.6, -80.8),  # The southeastern coast of Akimiski Island, which is part of Nunavut\n            \"description\": \"Akimiski Island (Nunavut)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    closest_location_name = None\n    min_distance = float('inf')\n\n    print(f\"Calculating distances from Waskaganish, QC ({waskaganish_lat}, {waskaganish_lon})...\\n\")\n\n    for name, data in locations.items():\n        dest_lat, dest_lon = data[\"coords\"]\n        distance = calculate_distance(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, dest_lat, dest_lon)\n\n        print(f\"The distance from Waskaganish to {data['description']} is {distance:.2f} km.\")\n\n        if distance < min_distance:\n            min_distance = distance\n            closest_location_name = name\n\n    print(f\"\\nBased on the calculations, the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is {closest_location_name}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"
