    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to find the maximum possible number of *different* clique sizes that can exist as *induced subgraphs* within a single graph of `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Analyze \"Induced Clique\":** Let's understand the structure of induced cliques. If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k` (a `K_k`), it means there's a set of `k` vertices where every vertex is connected to every other. If we take any subset of `j` vertices (where `1 <= j < k`) from this set, they will also form a complete graph among themselves, which is an induced `K_j`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Set of Clique Sizes:** Based on the point above, if a graph's largest induced clique has size `k_max` (this is called the graph's clique number, `ω(G)`), then it's guaranteed to have induced cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to `k_max`. The set of possible induced clique sizes for this graph is therefore `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`. Consequently, the *number* of different clique sizes is exactly `k_max`.\n\n4.  **Reframe the Problem:** The original question can now be simplified: \"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for any graph `G` with 128 vertices?\"\n\n5.  **Solve the Simplified Problem:** A clique in a graph is a subset of its vertices. Therefore, the size of the largest clique (`ω(G)`) cannot exceed the total number of vertices (`n`). So, `ω(G) <= 128`.\n\n6.  **Construct the Optimal Graph:** We can achieve this maximum value. The complete graph on `n` vertices, denoted `K_n`, is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For `n=128`, the graph `K_128` has a clique number of 128.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The maximum possible clique number is 128. This means the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is also 128.\n\n8.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that codifies this line of reasoning and prints the final answer. The script will explicitly state the \"final equation\" as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph\n    on n vertices and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(f\"The graph has n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the relationship between clique sizes.\")\n    print(\"If a graph has an induced clique of size k, it means there is a set of k vertices, all connected to each other.\")\n    print(\"Any subset of these k vertices (e.g., a subset of size j < k) also forms an induced clique.\")\n    print(\"This implies that if a graph's largest clique is of size k_max, it must contain induced cliques of all sizes: 1, 2, 3, ..., k_max.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Relating the number of clique sizes to the clique number.\")\n    print(\"The total number of different clique sizes in a graph is therefore equal to the size of its largest clique (its clique number, ω(G)).\")\n    print(\"So, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Finding the maximum clique number.\")\n    print(f\"For any graph with n = {n} vertices, the size of a clique cannot be more than n.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible clique number is achieved with the complete graph K_{n}, where all vertices are interconnected.\")\n    print(f\"The clique number of K_{n} is n.\")\n    \n    # The final calculation/equation\n    max_sizes = n\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The final conclusion is given by the equation:\")\n    # Printing each \"number\" or component of the final statement as requested.\n    print(\"Maximum number of different clique sizes\", \"=\", f\"{max_sizes}\")\n    \nsolve_max_clique_sizes()\n\n```\n<<<128>>>"
