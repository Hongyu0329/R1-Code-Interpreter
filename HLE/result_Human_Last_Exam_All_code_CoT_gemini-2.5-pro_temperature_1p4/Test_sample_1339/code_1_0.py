def solve_group_theory_problem():
    """
    Solves the given group theory problem based on logical deduction from the notation.

    The problem statement implies G must be the trivial group due to the ascending
    normal series ending in {1}.
    G = G_1 triangleleft G_2triangleleft ...triangleleft G_ntriangleleft G_{n+1} = {1}
    This means G_1 is a normal subgroup of G_2, etc. which implies G_1 subset G_2.
    The series G_ntriangleleft {1} forces G_n = {1}, and by induction G_1 = G = {1}.

    (a) For G={1}, any system is solvable in G itself. Thus, the minimal group G_hat is G={1}.
        This exists and is unique. So the answer is "Yes".

    (b) The derived length of G_hat = {1} is 0. This is the only possible value, so it is the maximum.
