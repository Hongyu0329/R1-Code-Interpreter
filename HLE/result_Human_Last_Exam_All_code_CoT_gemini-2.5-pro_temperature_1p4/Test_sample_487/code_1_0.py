# Step 1: Define parameters for the involution psi on the curve C.
# C is a complex curve of genus 2.
g = 2
# An involution on a curve of genus g has at most 2g+2 fixed points.
# We choose the hyperelliptic involution to maximize this number.
N = 2 * g + 2
print(f"The involution psi on the curve C has {N} fixed points.")

# Step 2: Define the configuration of the fixed locus for the involution rho on the K3 surface S.
# Based on the classification of non-symplectic involutions on K3 surfaces, a configuration that maximizes our target value is chosen.
# The fixed locus S^rho consists of m curves and L isolated points.
# This configuration has one elliptic curve, 8 rational curves, and 4 isolated points.
num_elliptic_curves = 1
num_rational_curves = 8
m = num_elliptic_curves + num_rational_curves
L = 4
# The genera of the curves are g=1 for the elliptic curve and g=0 for rational curves.
sum_g = 1 * num_elliptic_curves + 0 * num_rational_curves
print(f"The chosen involution rho on the K3 surface S has a fixed locus with:")
print(f"- {m} curves (1 elliptic, 8 rational)")
print(f"- {L} isolated points")

# Step 3: Calculate the Euler characteristic of the fixed locus S^rho.
# chi(S^rho) = L + sum_i (2 - 2*g_i) = L + 2*m - 2*sum(g_i)
chi_S_rho = L + 2 * m - 2 * sum_g
print(f"The Euler characteristic of the fixed locus is chi(S^rho) = {L} + 2*{m} - 2*{sum_g} = {chi_S_rho}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the dimension of the invariant part of H^{1,1}(S).
# The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem for a non-symplectic involution on a K3 surface gives the relation:
# chi(S^rho) = 2 * h^{1,1}(S)^+ - 20
h11_S_plus = (chi_S_rho + 20) // 2
print(f"The dimension of the invariant part of H^1,1(S) is h11(S)+ = ({chi_S_rho} + 20) / 2 = {h11_S_plus}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the h^{1,1} of the singular quotient Y = (S x C) / (rho x psi).
# h^{1,1}(Y) = h^{1,1}(S)^+ + h^{1,1}(C)^+ = h^{1,1}(S)^+ + 1
h11_Y = h11_S_plus + 1
print(f"The Hodge number of the singular quotient is h11(Y) = {h11_S_plus} + 1 = {h11_Y}.")

# Step 6: Calculate the contribution from resolving the singularities.
# This is given by the total number of singular components, which is N * (m + L).
delta_h11 = N * (m + L)
print(f"The contribution from the resolution is Delta_h11 = {N} * ({m} + {L}) = {delta_h11}.")

# Step 7: Calculate the final Hodge number h^{1,1}(M) of the resolved manifold.
h11_M = h11_Y + delta_h11
print(f"The maximal Hodge number is h11(M) = h11(Y) + Delta_h11 = {h11_Y} + {delta_h11} = {h11_M}.")
