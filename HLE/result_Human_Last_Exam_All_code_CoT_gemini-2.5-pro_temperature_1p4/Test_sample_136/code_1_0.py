# The degree of any vertex in the 2D torus is the number of its neighbors.
d = 4

# Let's consider a neighbor 'y' of x_0 from which the conditioned walk is most likely to approach.
# Due to the strong repulsion from vertex 0, this neighbor 'y' will not be a neighbor of 0.
# The walk at 'y' has 'd' possible next steps, each with equal probability.
num_choices_from_y = d

# One of these choices leads to x_0.
num_choices_to_x0 = 1

# The probability of the walk hitting x_0 in the next step, given it is at y.
prob_hit_x0 = num_choices_to_x0 / num_choices_from_y

# The problem asks for the probability that x_0 was NOT visited.
# This corresponds to the probability of not taking the step to x_0.
limit_probability = 1 - prob_hit_x0

# We print the final equation with the numbers.
print(f"The limiting conditional probability is calculated as: 1 - ({num_choices_to_x0} / {num_choices_from_y})")
