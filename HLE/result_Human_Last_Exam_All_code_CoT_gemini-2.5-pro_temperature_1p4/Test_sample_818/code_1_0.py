def solve():
    """
    This function solves for M(0), M(3), and M(5).
    M(n) is the smallest number of vertices m for which a simple cubic graph G exists
    with N(G) (the number of slices) being a multiple of n.

    - M(0): N(G) is a multiple of 0 means N(G) = 0. A cubic graph G has N(G) = 0
      if and only if it has a bridge. The smallest simple cubic graph with a bridge
      is known to have 10 vertices. So, M(0) = 10.

    - M(3): We need N(G) to be a multiple of 3. The smallest simple cubic graph is K_4,
      with m=4 vertices. The number of slices for K_4 is 9. Since 9 is a multiple of 3,
      and m=4 is the smallest possible, M(3) = 4.

    - M(5): We need N(G) to be a multiple of 5.
      - m=4: N(K_4) = 9 (not a multiple of 5).
      - m=6: The two cubic graphs on 6 vertices have N(G) = 23 and N(G) = 33 (not multiples of 5).
      - m=8: There are 5 cubic graphs on 8 vertices. One of them has N(G) = 65, which is a
        multiple of 5.
      Since m=8 is the smallest size for which a graph has N(G) as a multiple of 5, M(5) = 8.
