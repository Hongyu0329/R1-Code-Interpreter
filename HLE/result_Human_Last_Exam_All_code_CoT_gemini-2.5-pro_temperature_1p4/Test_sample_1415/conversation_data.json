    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The core of the problem is to evaluate the definite integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1. This form, ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx, is a standard integral whose result is ln|f(x)|.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: Using the result from step 1, the definite integral is calculated as:\n    [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|.\n3.  **Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits**: We need to find the values of F₃(1) and F₃(0). The function is defined as F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))).\n    *   At x = 0: F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2).\n    *   At x = 1: F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))).\n4.  **Check the sign of F₃(x)**: For x in the interval [0, 1], sin(x) is always non-negative. This means e^(sin(x)) ≥ 1, so 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2. Therefore, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) is always positive, and we can safely remove the absolute value bars. The integral's value V is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V. We will write a Python script to compute the numerical value of V and then perform this final calculation. The script will print the values for F₃(0), F₃(1), the final equation for V, and the final integer result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral problem and reports the final value as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The integral to evaluate is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n    # The antiderivative of f'(x)/f(x) is ln|f(x)|.\n    # By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral is ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|.\n    # F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))).
