    Identifies the line numbers in triangle.py that contain programming errors.
    
    Errors are identified based on the following:
    - Line 11: The `^` operator is used on integers. In Python, this is bitwise XOR, not exponentiation (`**`). This leads to incorrect distance calculations.
    - Lines 22 & 23: The `/` operator is used between integers. In Python 3, this performs float division, which violates the specification for precise, non-floating-point arithmetic. The result should be an exact rational number as shown in the example session.
    - Lines 29, 30, & 31: The `^` operator is used to square the result of `_distance`. When `_distance` returns a Sage integer (for sides of integer length), `^` performs an incorrect bitwise XOR operation instead of exponentiation. Code should use `**` for robust correctness.
