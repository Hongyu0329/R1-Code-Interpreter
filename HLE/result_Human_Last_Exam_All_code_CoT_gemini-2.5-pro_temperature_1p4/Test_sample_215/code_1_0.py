    # --- Analysis of the Script Logic ---

    # 1. The `generate_chemistry` function creates specimens where, for any given
    #    chemical peak, all values are initially drawn from the same distribution.
    #    This means all specimens start out fundamentally similar.

    # 2. A single `baseline` vector is generated within each call to the function.

    # 3. For the 'control' group, the function is called with `treatment = 'control'`.
    #    There is only one unique treatment. The code subtracts the *same* baseline
    #    vector from every one of the 360 control specimens.
    #    Since all specimens are processed identically, they form a single group.
    control_chemotypes = 1

    # 4. The same process occurs for the 'water_stress' group. A new baseline
    #    is generated, and it is subtracted from all 510 water-stressed specimens.
    #    This also results in a single, coherent group.
    water_stress_chemotypes = 1

    # --- Conclusion ---
