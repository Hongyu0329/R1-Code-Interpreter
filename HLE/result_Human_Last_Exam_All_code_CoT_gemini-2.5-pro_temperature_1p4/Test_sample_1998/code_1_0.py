# The field described in the problem is a 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2.
# Let 'd' be the dimension parameter of the field.
d = 2

# The smallest natural number N with the property that every anisotropic quadratic form
# in N variables is surjective is equal to the u-invariant of the field.
# For a d-dimensional local field of characteristic 2, the u-invariant is given by the formula 2**(d+1).
base = 2
exponent = d + 1
N = base**exponent

# We print out the calculation step-by-step as requested.
# The equation is N = base^(d + 1).
print("The final calculation for N is based on the formula N = 2^(d+1), where d is the dimension of the local field.")
