    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given properties of the group G.**\n    *   `G` is a topological group.\n    *   `G` is compact.\n    *   `G` is first-countable, which means its character `\\chi(G)` is `\\aleph_0`.\n    *   The cardinality of `G` is `|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}`.\n    *   `G` is not necessarily Hausdorff. This is a crucial detail.\n    *   The goal is to find the maximum possible weight, `w(G)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Hausdorff quotient group.**\n    Let `N = cl({e})` be the closure of the identity element in `G`. Since `G` is a topological group, `N` is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group `H = G/N` is a Hausdorff topological group. This group `H` inherits several properties from `G`:\n    *   `H` is compact (as the continuous image of a compact space).\n    *   `H` is first-countable (the quotient map preserves local bases).\n    *   A key theorem in the theory of topological groups states that the weight is preserved under this quotient, i.e., `w(G) = w(H)`.\n    So, the problem is transformed into finding the maximum possible weight of a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group `H` that can be a quotient of a group `G` with cardinality `2^{2^\\frak c}`.\n\n3.  **Establish an upper bound for the weight.**\n    *   `H` is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable space.\n    *   A fundamental theorem by A. V. Arhangel'skii states that any compact, first-countable Hausdorff space `X` has a cardinality of at most `2^{\\aleph_0}`, which is `\\frak c` (the cardinality of the continuum).\n    *   Therefore, `|H| \\le \\frak c`.\n    *   For any topological group `H`, its weight is related to its density `d(H)` and character `\\chi(H)` by the formula `w(H) = d(H) \\cdot \\chi(H)`.\n    *   Since `H` is first-countable, `\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0`. The formula becomes `w(H) = \\max(d(H), \\aleph_0)` because the density `d(H)` must be an infinite cardinal for a non-discrete infinite group.\n    *   The density of a space is always less than or equal to its cardinality, so `d(H) \\le |H|`.\n    *   Combining these facts: `d(H) \\le |H| \\le \\frak c`.\n    *   This implies `w(H) = \\max(d(H), \\aleph_0) \\le \\max(\\frak c, \\aleph_0) = \\frak c`.\n    *   Since `w(G) = w(H)`, we have established an upper bound for the weight of `G`: `w(G) \\le \\frak c`.\n\n4.  **Show that this upper bound is achievable.**\n    To show that `\\frak c` is the largest *possible* weight, we must construct a group `G` that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of exactly `\\frak c`.\n    *   We can construct `G` as a product of two groups: `G = H_0 \\times N`.\n    *   For `H_0`, we need a group that models the properties of our Hausdorff quotient `H`. We choose `H_0` to be a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group with weight `w(H_0) = \\frak c`. The existence of such a group is a known result in topology (e.g., a construction by S. Sirota). Such a group necessarily has cardinality `|H_0| = \\frak c` and density `d(H_0) = \\frak c`.\n    *   For `N`, we need to account for the large cardinality of `G`. Let `N` be any abstract group of cardinality `2^{2^\\frak c}` equipped with the **indiscrete topology** (where the only open sets are `\\emptyset` and `N`).\n    *   Now, let's check the properties of our constructed group `G = H_0 \\times N`:\n        *   **Cardinality**: `|G| = |H_0| \\cdot |N| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}`. This matches the requirement.\n        *   **Compactness**: `H_0` is compact by choice, and `N` (with the indiscrete topology) is compact. The product of two compact spaces is compact. So `G` is compact.\n        *   **First-countability**: The character of a product group is the maximum of the characters of its factors. `\\chi(H_0) = \\aleph_0` (since it's first-countable) and `\\chi(N) = 1` (since its only neighborhood of the identity is `N` itself). So `\\chi(G) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0`. `G` is first-countable.\n        *   **Non-Hausdorff**: Since `N` is not Hausdorff, their product `G` is also not Hausdorff.\n        *   **Weight**: The weight of a product of two topological spaces is the sum of their weights. `w(G) = w(H_0) + w(N)`. We chose `w(H_0) = \\frak c`. The weight of `N` with the indiscrete topology is `1` (a base is just `{N}`). So, `w(G) = \\frak c + 1 = \\frak c`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    We have shown that the weight of any such group `G` cannot exceed `\\frak c`, and we have constructed a group `G` that satisfies all conditions and has a weight of `\\frak c`. Therefore, the largest possible weight is `\\frak c`. The cardinal `\\frak c` is equal to `2^{\\aleph_0}`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the derivation of the largest possible weight of the topological group G.\n    \n    Let G be a compact, first-countable topological group of cardinality 2**(2**c),\n    where c is the cardinality of the continuum (2**aleph_0).\n\n    1.  The weight of a topological group G, w(G), is equal to the weight of its\n        Hausdorff quotient group, H = G/cl({e}). So, w(G) = w(H).\n\n    2.  The group H is compact, Hausdorff, and first-countable.\n\n    3.  A theorem by Arhangel'skii states that a compact, Hausdorff,\n        first-countable space has a cardinality of at most c (2**aleph_0).\n        Therefore, |H| <= c.\n\n    4.  The weight of a topological group H is given by w(H) = d(H) * chi(H),\n        where d(H) is the density and chi(H) is the character.\n        Since H is first-countable, chi(H) = aleph_0.\n        So, w(H) = max(d(H), aleph_0).\n\n    5.  The density d(H) is at most the cardinality |H|. So, d(H) <= |H| <= c.\n\n    6.  From this, we deduce an upper bound for the weight:\n        w(H) <= max(c, aleph_0) = c.\n        Thus, w(G) <= c.\n\n    7.  To show this bound is achievable, we construct a group G with w(G) = c\n        that meets all criteria. Let G = H_0 x N, where H_0 is a compact,\n        Hausdorff, first-countable group of weight c (such groups exist), and N\n        is a group of cardinality 2**(2**c) with the indiscrete topology.\n\n    8.  This constructed G is compact, first-countable, has cardinality 2**(2**c),\n        and is not Hausdorff. Its weight is w(G) = w(H_0) + w(N) = c + 1 = c.\n\n    9.  Therefore, the largest possible weight is c.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The cardinal c is defined as 2 raised to the power of aleph_0.\n    # aleph_0 is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.\n    aleph_0 = \"aleph_0\" # Representing the cardinal as a string\n    c = f\"2**{aleph_0}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The largest possible weight of the group G is the cardinal c.\")\n    print(f\"The value of c is 2 to the power of aleph_0 (the first infinite cardinal).\")\n    # There is no numerical equation to output, so we print the final symbolic value.\n    # To satisfy the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # we present c in its form 2^aleph_0.\n    final_equation = f\"w_max = 2^{{\\aleph_0}}\"\n    print(\"The final answer can be expressed as an equation:\")\n    print(f\"w_max = 2^aleph_0\")\n    print(f\"The numbers in this equation are 2 and 0 (from aleph_0).\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<$2^{\\aleph_0}$>>>"
