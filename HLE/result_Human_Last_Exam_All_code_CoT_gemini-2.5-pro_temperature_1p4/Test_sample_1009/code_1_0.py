    This function explains the derivation of the largest possible weight of the topological group G.
    
    Let G be a compact, first-countable topological group of cardinality 2**(2**c),
    where c is the cardinality of the continuum (2**aleph_0).

    1.  The weight of a topological group G, w(G), is equal to the weight of its
        Hausdorff quotient group, H = G/cl({e}). So, w(G) = w(H).

    2.  The group H is compact, Hausdorff, and first-countable.

    3.  A theorem by Arhangel'skii states that a compact, Hausdorff,
        first-countable space has a cardinality of at most c (2**aleph_0).
        Therefore, |H| <= c.

    4.  The weight of a topological group H is given by w(H) = d(H) * chi(H),
        where d(H) is the density and chi(H) is the character.
        Since H is first-countable, chi(H) = aleph_0.
        So, w(H) = max(d(H), aleph_0).

    5.  The density d(H) is at most the cardinality |H|. So, d(H) <= |H| <= c.

    6.  From this, we deduce an upper bound for the weight:
        w(H) <= max(c, aleph_0) = c.
        Thus, w(G) <= c.

    7.  To show this bound is achievable, we construct a group G with w(G) = c
        that meets all criteria. Let G = H_0 x N, where H_0 is a compact,
        Hausdorff, first-countable group of weight c (such groups exist), and N
        is a group of cardinality 2**(2**c) with the indiscrete topology.

    8.  This constructed G is compact, first-countable, has cardinality 2**(2**c),
        and is not Hausdorff. Its weight is w(G) = w(H_0) + w(N) = c + 1 = c.

    9.  Therefore, the largest possible weight is c.
