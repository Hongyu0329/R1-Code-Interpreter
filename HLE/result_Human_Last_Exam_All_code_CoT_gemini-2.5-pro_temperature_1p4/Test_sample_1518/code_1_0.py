The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a profound non-perturbative principle in quantum field theory. It states that the anomaly coefficient for any global symmetry must be identical when calculated in the high-energy (UV) theory and the low-energy (IR) effective theory.

This principle is expressed by the fundamental equation:
Anomaly_UV = Anomaly_IR

Physical Implication:
The UV anomaly is determined by the fundamental fields of the theory (e.g., quarks in QCD). The IR anomaly is determined by the composite, low-energy degrees of freedom (e.g., pions). For a proposed low-energy effective theory to be a valid description of the UV physics, it *must* reproduce the same anomaly.

Therefore, the most crucial and general physical implication of this condition is that it serves as a powerful **constraint on low-energy effective theories**. Any proposed theory for the low-energy dynamics that fails this test can be immediately ruled out.

This makes choice (C) the best answer. It correctly identifies the condition's primary role as a non-perturbative consistency check. Other choices, while related, are less complete:
- J) 'Constrains low-energy degrees of freedom': True, but it also constrains their interactions. The entire 'effective theory' (C) is a more complete statement.
- F) 'Anomalies dictate symmetry realization': This is a key consequence of the constraint, as the IR must find a way (e.g., via Goldstone bosons or massless fermions) to match the anomaly, but the core implication is the constraint itself.
