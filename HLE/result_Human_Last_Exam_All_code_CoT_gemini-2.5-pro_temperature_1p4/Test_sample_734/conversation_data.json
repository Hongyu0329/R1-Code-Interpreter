    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key elements of the user's question:\n1.  **Christian theologian**: This specifies the field of the person in question.\n2.  **First developed specialized terminology**: This points to an originator of a specific conceptual framework and language.\n3.  **Describe changes in the laws of nature**: This is the core concept the terminology addresses. It's not just about miracles suspending laws, but the potential for the laws themselves to be altered.\n4.  **Applicable to two specific cases**: The Virgin Birth of Jesus and the changes to nature at the Fall of Man.\n\nMy analysis suggests that the theologian who best fits this description is **Augustine of Hippo** (354â€“430 AD).\n\nHere is why:\n*   Augustine was a foundational thinker for Western Christianity. In his works, particularly *The City of God* and his commentaries on Genesis, he extensively discussed God's relationship to the natural world.\n*   He developed the terminology to distinguish between the **\"ordinary course of nature\" (*consuetudo naturae*)** and the **will of God (*voluntas Dei*)**.\n*   For Augustine, a miracle (like the virgin birth) was not *contra naturam* (against nature), because God is the author of nature itself. Instead, it was ***praeter consuetudinem naturae*** (beyond the *custom* of nature). God isn't breaking his own rules; he is simply acting directly according to his will, which is the ultimate \"law\" of reality.\n*   This framework elegantly applies to both cases. The Virgin Birth is an event where God's will produced a result beyond the ordinary biological process. The Fall resulted in changes to the state of creation (e.g., the introduction of mortality and decay for humanity), which can be understood as God altering the \"ordinary course of nature\" as a consequence of sin.\n\nTherefore, Augustine is the first major theologian to create a systematic, terminological framework for understanding these types of divine actions.\n\nHere is the python code that will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the Christian theologian who developed\n    specialized terminology applicable to changes in natural law, specifically\n    in the context of the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"Augustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specialized \"\n        \"conceptual framework and terminology for describing such events. He distinguished \"\n        \"between the 'ordinary course of nature' (consuetudo naturae) and God's direct will \"\n        \"(voluntas Dei). For Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth was not against nature \"\n        \"(contra naturam) but simply 'beyond the custom of nature' (praeter consuetudinem naturae). \"\n        \"This same logic allows for describing the consequences of the Fall as a divinely \"\n        \"willed alteration of the previous natural order.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Theologian: {theologian}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
