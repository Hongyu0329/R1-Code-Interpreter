    # Step 1: Evaluate 3D Diffusion
    print("\n[Analysis of Method E: 3D Diffusion]")
    print("  - 3D Diffusion theory is a simplification of the neutron transport equation.")
    print("  - It is computationally fast but relies on assumptions that are invalid during accident scenarios.")
    print("  - Specifically, it fails near strong absorbers, material boundaries, and in voided regions (e.g., from coolant boiling).")
    print("  - Conclusion: Unsuitable for accurate accident analysis.")

    # Step 2: Evaluate Pn and Discrete Ordinates
    print("\n[Analysis of Methods A (Pn Transport) and B (Discrete Ordinates)]")
    print("  - These are deterministic methods that solve the neutron transport equation more accurately than diffusion.")
    print("  - They can better handle anisotropic scattering and flux gradients.")
    print("  - However, they can suffer from numerical artifacts like 'ray effects', especially in complex geometries with low-density regions (voids).")
    print("  - They also typically rely on multi-group cross-sections, which average over energy details that can be important in accidents.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Better than diffusion, but have significant limitations for high-fidelity accident simulation.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate Monte Carlo Methods
    print("\n[Analysis of Methods C and D: Monte Carlo]")
    print("  - Monte Carlo methods simulate the behavior of individual neutrons stochastically.")
    print("  - Key Advantage 1 (Geometry): They can model arbitrarily complex 3D geometries with virtually no approximation. This is essential for accident analysis.")
    print("  - Key Advantage 2 (Physics): They typically use continuous-energy nuclear data, capturing fine physical details (like resonance effects) without the need for group averaging.")
    print("  - Due to this high fidelity in both geometry and physics, Monte Carlo is considered the 'gold standard' for complex reactor physics problems.")
    print("  - Conclusion: The most physically accurate and suitable method for accident scenarios, despite being computationally intensive.")
    
    # Step 4: Compare Monte Carlo Options C and D
    print("\n[Comparing Option C (Serpent w/ ENDF/B-VII.1) vs. D (MCNP w/ ENDF/B-VIII.1)]")
    print("  - Both MCNP and Serpent are state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes.")
    print("  - The primary differentiator here is the nuclear data library: ENDF/B (Evaluated Nuclear Data File).")
    print("  - ENDF/B-VIII.1 is a more recent release than ENDF/B-VII.1.")
    print("  - Newer data libraries incorporate updated experimental data and improved theoretical models, generally leading to more accurate results.")
    print("  - Therefore, using the most up-to-date, high-quality data library is crucial for the most accurate prediction.")

    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The Monte Carlo method offers the highest fidelity for complex accident scenarios. Option D is the most suitable choice as it combines a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo code (MCNP) with the most recent major release of the nuclear data library (ENDF/B-VIII.1), ensuring the highest possible accuracy for the prediction.")
