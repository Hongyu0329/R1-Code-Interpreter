    "This is a classic chess puzzle that requires a bit of logical deduction. The key is to understand the constraints of the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the 'edge squares'**: An 8x8 chessboard has 4 sides. Each side has 8 squares, but the 4 corner squares are common to two sides. So, the total number of edge squares is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n2.  **Interpret 'placing as many bishops as possible'**: If we could place bishops without any rules, we would simply fill all 28 squares. The puzzle implies a constraint, which in chess piece placement puzzles is almost always the 'non-attacking' rule. So, the goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on these 28 squares.\n3.  **Use bishop properties**: A bishop on a white square can only attack other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other black squares. The 28 edge squares are divided into 14 white and 14 black squares. We can solve the problem for each color independently.\n4.  **Solve for one color**: By analyzing the attack patterns, it can be determined that a maximum of 10 non-attacking bishops can be placed on the 14 edge squares of a single color.\n5.  **Calculate the total**: Since the problem can be solved independently for each color, the total number of bishops that can be placed is 10 (on white) + 10 (on black) = 20.\n6.  **Find the difference**: The number of empty squares is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these calculations and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of edge squares on a chessboard that would\n    lack bishops if the maximum number of non-attacking bishops were placed.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_side_length = 8\n    corners = 4\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An 8x8 board has 8 squares per side.
