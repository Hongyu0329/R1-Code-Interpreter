    # --- Scenario 1: Simultaneous Guessing (Finding N) ---
    #
    # The optimal strategy is for the group to make guesses based on the sum
    # of all hat colors modulo 4. Each individual is assigned a "target sum"
    # from {0, 1, 2, 3}. They guess the hat color that would make the total
    # sum equal their assigned target.
    #
    # For any given set of hats, the actual sum will be one of {0, 1, 2, 3}.
    # Only the individuals whose target sum matches the actual sum will be correct.
    # To maximize the guaranteed number of correct guesses (N), the 9 individuals
    # must be divided as evenly as possible among the 4 possible target sums.
    #
    # 9 individuals / 4 outcomes = 2 with a remainder of 1.
    # This results in one group of 3, and three groups of 2.
    # In the worst-case scenario, the actual sum will match the target of one
    # of the smaller groups.
    N = num_individuals // num_outcomes

    # --- Scenario 2: One Person Guesses First (Finding M) ---
    #
    # The first person (P1) sacrifices their guess to provide information.
    # P1 calculates the sum of the other 8 hats they see (mod 4) and announces
    # this value as their guess.
    # The other 8 individuals hear this number. They also see P1's actual hat color.
    # By adding P1's actual hat color to the sum announced by P1, they can
    # all determine the true sum of all 9 hats.
    #
    # Knowing the total sum, each of the remaining 8 individuals can subtract the
    # sum of the hats they see from the total sum to perfectly deduce their own hat color.
    # This means these 8 individuals will always be correct.
    M = num_individuals - 1

    # --- Part 3: Calculate the difference (M - N) ---
