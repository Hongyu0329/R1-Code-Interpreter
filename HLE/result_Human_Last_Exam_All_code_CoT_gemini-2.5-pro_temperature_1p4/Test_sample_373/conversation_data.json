    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each. These two cliques are connected by a single edge, known as the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:**\n    *   Let's label the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge as `b1` and `b2`.\n    *   Node `b1` is part of a 5-node clique, so it's connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. It's also connected to `b2` via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, the total number of neighbors (degree) for `b1` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, the degree of `b2` is also 5.\n    *   Any other node `v` is only connected to the other 4 nodes within its own clique, so its degree is 4.\n3.  **Understand Uniform Gossiping:** In this process, we first select one node from all 10 nodes uniformly at random (probability `1/10` for any node). Then, that selected node chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(b1, b2)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events happens:\n    *   **Event A:** Node `b1` is selected, and it then selects node `b2`.\n        *   The probability of selecting `b1` is `1/10`.\n        *   Given `b1` is selected, the probability it selects `b2` is `1 / degree(b1)`, which is `1/5`.\n        *   The probability of Event A is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   **Event B:** Node `b2` is selected, and it then selects node `b1`.\n        *   The probability of selecting `b2` is `1/10`.\n        *   Given `b2` is selected, the probability it selects `b1` is `1 / degree(b2)`, which is `1/5`.\n        *   The probability of Event B is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n5.  **Sum the Probabilities:** The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events: `P(total) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_barbell_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes during uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    n = 10\n\n    # A standard barbell graph with n nodes has two cliques of size m=n/2\n    m = n / 2\n\n    # The nodes connected by the bottleneck edge (let's call them b1 and b2)\n    # are each connected to (m-1) nodes in their own clique plus 1 node\n    # across the bridge.\n    # So, their degree is (m-1) + 1 = m.\n    degree_bridge_node = m\n\n    # The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (b1, b2) is the sum\n    # of two probabilities:\n    # 1.

The probability of sampling the bottleneck is the sum of two mutually exclusive events: node 'b1' choosing 'b2', or node 'b2' choosing 'b1'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P(bottleneck) = P(pick b1) * P(b1 picks b2) + P(pick b2) * P(b2 picks b1)\")\n    print(f\"P(bottleneck) = (1/{int(n)}) * (1/{int(degree_bridge_node)}) + (1/{int(n)}) * (1/{int(degree_bridge_node)})\")\n    print(f\"P(bottleneck) = {prob_one_direction} + {prob_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"P(bottleneck) = {total_probability}\")\n\nsolve_barbell_gossip_probability()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
