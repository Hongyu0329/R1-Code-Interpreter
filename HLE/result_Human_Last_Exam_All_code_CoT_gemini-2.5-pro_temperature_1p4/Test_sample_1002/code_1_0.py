# The problem asks for the computation of a limit, which results in a formula dependent on k.
# As derived from the analysis of the Zarankiewicz problem, the limit is 1 - 1/(2k).
# We will represent this formula. The problem statement asks to output each number in the final equation.

# Define the numbers appearing in the formula
one_numerator = 1
one_denominator = 1
two_denominator = 2

# Define k as a symbol for printing
k = sympy.symbols('k')

# Print the formula using the defined numbers and symbol
# This satisfies the requirement to "output each number in the final equation"
print(f"The computed limit is: {one_numerator} - {one_denominator} / ({two_denominator} * {k})")

# We can also display the simplified version of the formula.
# 1 - 1/(2k) = (2k - 1) / (2k)
simplified_numerator = 2 * k - 1
simplified_denominator = 2 * k
print(f"In simplified form: ({simplified_numerator}) / ({simplified_denominator})")
