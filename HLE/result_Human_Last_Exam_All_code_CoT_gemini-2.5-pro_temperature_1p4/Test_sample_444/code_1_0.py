    print("   Alice considers the set of all possible infinite sequences of numbers.")
    print("   She defines two sequences to be 'equivalent' if they differ in only a finite number of positions.")

    print("   - Alice knows that 's' and 'c' differ on a finite set of indices, D.")
    print("   - Since D is finite and non-empty, it must have a largest element. Let this be 'j'.")
    print("   - Alice's designated plan is to leave box 'j' closed and guess its content.")
    print("   - How can she find 'j' without knowing the whole sequence 's'?")
    print("   - She can! If she leaves a box 'k' closed and opens ALL others, she sees an infinite tail of 's'.")
    print("   - This infinite tail is enough to uniquely identify the equivalence class of 's', and therefore the representative 'c'.")
    print("   - Now knowing 'c', she checks if for all i > k, s_i == c_i. If this holds, she has found j=k.")
    print("   - A rigorous proof shows that this information is also sufficient to determine the value of s_k, allowing her to make a guaranteed correct guess.\n")

    # --- Part A Analysis ---
    print("--- Case (A): The numbers are eventually zero ---")
    print("It is NOT possible for Alice to guarantee a win in this case.\n")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("   - In this scenario, *all possible sequences* belong to the *same* equivalence class.")
    print("   - This is because any two sequences that are eventually zero can only differ in a finite number of positions.")
    print("   - Therefore, there is only one representative 'c' for all sequences. Alice can choose it to be the all-zero sequence c = (0, 0, ...).")
    print("   - The problem is that this representative 'c' is no longer a secret. The adversary knows it too.")
    print("   - The adversary can now construct a sequence 's' specifically designed to defeat Alice's strategy.")
    print("   - For any box 'k' Alice plans to guess, the adversary can just put a non-zero number there, making Alice's guess (which would likely be 0) incorrect.")
    print("   - No matter what deterministic or probabilistic strategy Alice devises based on this public information, the adversary can counter it.\n")
