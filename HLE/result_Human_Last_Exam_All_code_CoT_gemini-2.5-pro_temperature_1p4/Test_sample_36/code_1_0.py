    Calculates the number of unique sets of eigenvalues on the unit circle
    for representations of finite Abelian groups of cardinality 18.

    The problem reduces to finding the number of unique sets of roots of unity U_d
    that can be formed. These sets correspond to the divisors of the exponents of
    the abelian groups of order 18.

    The abelian groups of order 18 are Z_18 and Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_3.
    - The exponent of Z_18 is 18. The possible sets are {U_d} for d dividing 18.
    - The exponent of Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_3 is lcm(2, 3, 3) = 6. The possible sets are {U_d} for d dividing 6.

    The total number of unique sets is the size of the union of these possibilities.
    Since the divisors of 6 are a subset of the divisors of 18, the total
    number of unique sets is just the number of divisors of 18.
