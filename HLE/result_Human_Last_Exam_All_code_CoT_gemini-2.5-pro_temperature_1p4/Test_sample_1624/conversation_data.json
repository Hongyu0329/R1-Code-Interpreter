    "This is a problem in point-set topology. I will reason through the properties of the spaces X and U to determine an upper bound on the cardinality of X. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the properties of U:** The conditions given imply that U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. I will deduce its properties, specifically whether it's separable.\n2.  **Relate properties of U to X:** I will use the fact that U is dense in X to show that if U is separable, then X must also be separable.\n3.  **Bound the cardinality of X:** Once X is established as a separable metric space, I can use a standard theorem to place an upper bound on its cardinality.\n4.  **Verify the bound:** I will provide a simple example to show that this upper bound can be achieved.\n\nI will use a Python script to print out this reasoning step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the topological problem about the cardinality of a metric space X.\n    The code prints the logical steps of the mathematical proof.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the properties of the dense open subset U.\")\n    print(\"Let X be a connected metric space.\")\n    print(\"Let U be a dense open subset of X.\")\n    print(\"We are given that each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.\")\n    print(\"This is the definition of U being a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\")\n    print(\"Since U is a subspace of a metric space X, U is also a metric space, and therefore Hausdorff.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Show that U is separable.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem in manifold theory states that any Hausdorff manifold (like U) is second-countable.\")\n    print(\"For a metric space, being second-countable is equivalent to being separable (i.e., having a countable dense subset).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, U is a separable space.
