    "The user wants to identify the product of a chemical reaction and present the answer using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   **Solvent:** Tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH) is a polar protic solvent.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** These conditions strongly favor an E2 (elimination, bimolecular) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Requirements for E2:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry where the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (a β-proton) are in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair, this means the leaving group and the β-proton must both be in **axial** positions on adjacent carbons (a trans-diaxial arrangement).\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis of the Substrate:**\n    *   The substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, can exist in two chair conformations that are in equilibrium:\n        1.  **Diequatorial conformer:** The bromine (Br) and methyl (CH₃) groups are both in equatorial positions. This is the more stable and therefore major conformer, as bulky groups prefer the less crowded equatorial position.\n        2.  **Diaxial conformer:** The Br and CH₃ groups are both in axial positions. This is the less stable and minor conformer.\n    *   Let's check which conformer can react. The major (diequatorial) conformer has an equatorial Br. It has no β-protons that are anti-periplanar to the Br, so it is **unreactive** in an E2 reaction.\n    *   The reaction must therefore proceed through the minor (diaxial) conformer, where the Br is in an axial position.\n\n4.  **Identify the Product:**\n    *   In the reactive (diaxial) conformer, the axial Br is on carbon 1 (C1). We need to find an axial β-proton on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n    *   **On C2:** The methyl group is axial, which means the proton on C2 is equatorial. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial Br. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form a double bond between C1 and C2. This would have formed 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted, Zaitsev product).\n    *   **On C6:** This carbon has an axial proton. This proton *is* anti-periplanar to the axial Br on C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base can only remove the axial proton from C6. This is a stereoelectronically controlled reaction. The double bond will form between C1 and C6. The methyl group is unaffected on C2.\n    *   **Naming the product:** The product is an alkene with the methyl group at the 3-position relative to the double bond. The name is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   A simple Python script will be created to declare the name of the product and print it to the console. The strange instruction \"output each number in the final equation!\" will be interpreted as making sure the numbers in the chemical name (like '3') are part of the output.\n\n```python\n# The reaction is an E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\n# The E2 mechanism requires an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.\n# The reaction must proceed through the conformer where Br is axial.\n# In the (1S,2R) isomer, when Br is axial, the 2-methyl group is also axial.\n# The beta-protons are on C2 and C6.\n# - The C2 proton is equatorial (since the methyl group is axial). It cannot be eliminated. This would have formed the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n# - The C6 proton is axial and is anti-periplanar to the axial Br.\n# Therefore, elimination occurs by removing the C6 proton to form a double bond between C1 and C6.\n# The resulting product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n# The final equation is the name of the product.\n# We will construct the name and output it. The number in the name is 3.\nproduct_locant = 3\nproduct_name_base = \"methylcyclohexene\"\nproduct_name = f\"{product_locant}-{product_name_base}\"\n\nprint(\"The name of the major product is:\")\nprint(product_name)\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
