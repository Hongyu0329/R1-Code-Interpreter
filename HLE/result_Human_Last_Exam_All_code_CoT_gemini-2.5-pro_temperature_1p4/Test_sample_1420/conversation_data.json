    "In the context of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat can be calculated systematically using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This method expands the exponent as a power series in ϵ = d_c - d, where d_c is the upper critical dimension and d is the spatial dimension.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Identify the parameters for the problem. The spatial dimension is d=3. For the universality class of the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. This gives us ϵ = d_c - d.\n2.  Assume the most common case, the Ising universality class, where the order parameter has n=1 component.\n3.  Use the well-established formula for the specific heat exponent α, calculated to the first order in the epsilon expansion.\n4.  Write a Python script to substitute the values of ϵ and n into the formula, display the equation with the numbers, and compute the final value.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters for the problem.\nd = 3  # Spatial dimension\nd_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension\nn = 1  # Number of order parameter components (assuming Ising universality class)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate epsilon (ϵ)\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# Step 3: Use the first-order epsilon expansion formula for the specific heat exponent α.\n# The formula is α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n# The result as a fraction for precision\nalpha_fraction = sympy.Rational(numerator, denominator) * epsilon\n# The result as a floating-point number\nalpha_float = float(alpha_fraction)\n\n# Step 4: Print the explanation, the formula, the calculation, and the result.\nprint(\"Calculation of the specific heat scaling exponent α using first-order ϵ-expansion:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\nprint(f\"Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\nprint(f\"Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\nprint(f\"Number of order parameter components, n = {n} (Ising universality class)\")\nprint(f\"\\nFirst, we calculate epsilon: ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe first-order formula for α is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / ({2} * {n+8}) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe result is: α = {alpha_fraction}\")\nprint(f\"As a decimal, this is approximately: α ≈ {alpha_float:.4f}\")\n\n# The final answer is the floating point value.\nfinal_answer = alpha_float\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
