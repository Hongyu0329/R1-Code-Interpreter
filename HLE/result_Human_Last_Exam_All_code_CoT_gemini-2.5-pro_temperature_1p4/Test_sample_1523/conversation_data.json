    "Of course. Here is the explanation and the Python code to display the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to find the mathematical expression for the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` for a neutral scalar field in the context of finite-temperature field theory. This expression appears in the exponent of the functional integral for the partition function.\n2.  **Identify the Core Components:**\n    *   The partition function `Z` is given by the functional integral `∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`.\n    *   The Euclidean action `S_E` for a free, neutral scalar field `ϕ` is `S_E = ∫ dτ dᵈx [ ½((∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²) + ½m²ϕ² ]`.\n    *   The inner product `(f, g)` is defined as an integral over spacetime, `∫ dτ dᵈx f(x,τ)g(x,τ)`.\n3.  **Derive the Operator D:** By performing an integration by parts on the action `S_E` (and assuming periodic boundary conditions which make boundary terms vanish), we can rewrite the action as `S_E = ½ ∫ dτ dᵈx ϕ(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)ϕ`. This reveals that the operator `D` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, `D = (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)`.\n4.  **Formulate the Inner Product:** The expression `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is therefore `∫ dτ dᵈx ϕ(x,τ) [(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(x,τ)]`. This is exactly twice the free-field Euclidean action, `2*S_E`.\n5.  **Transform to Momentum Space:** Calculations in field theory are often simplified in momentum space. The derivatives transform into algebraic terms, and the expression becomes much clearer.\n    *   The field `ϕ(x, τ)` is expanded in Fourier modes `ϕ̃(p, ωₙ)`.\n    *   The derivatives become `∂_τ → iωₙ` and `∇ → ip`.\n    *   The operator `D` becomes `p² + ωₙ² + m²`.\n    *   The integral and sum over spacetime become a sum over Matsubara frequencies `ωₙ` and an integral over momentum `p`.\n6.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that uses the `print()` function to display the final, formatted expression in momentum space, along with clear definitions for all the mathematical symbols involved. This script will not perform a numerical calculation but will present the formal answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the expression for the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) for a neutral scalar field\n    in the context of finite-temperature field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Using Unicode for clear mathematical notation ---\n    phi = \"\\u03D5\"\n    D_op = \"D\"\n    sum_symbol = \"\\u03A3\"\n    integral = \"\\u222B\"\n    partial = \"\\u2202\"\n    nabla = \"\\u2207\"\n    beta = \"\\u03B2\"\n    omega = \"\\u03C9\"\n    pi = \"\\u03C0\"\n    phi_tilde = f\"{phi}\\u0303\"\n\n    # The equation represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action in momentum space.\n    # Full action S_E = (1/2) * (ϕ, Dϕ)\n    # The numbers in the equation are 2 (as in 2π) and d (for dimensions).\n    # All powers are also 2.\n    term1 = f\"({phi}, {D_op}{phi})\"\n    sum_part = f\"{sum_symbol}\\u2099\"  # Sum over n\n    integral_part = f\"{integral} d\\u1d48p / ({2}{pi})\\u1d48\"  # ∫ dᵈp / (2π)ᵈ\n    field_part = f\"|{phi_tilde}(p, {omega}\\u2099)|\\u00b2\"  # |ϕ̃(p, ωₙ)|²\n    propagator_part = f\"(p\\u00b2 + {omega}\\u2099\\u00b2 + m\\u00b2)\"\n\n    equation = f\"{term1} = {sum_part} {integral_part} {field_part} {propagator_part}\"\n\n    # --- Print the formatted output ---\n    print(\"In the functional integral representation of the partition function, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is the quadratic form in the exponent.\")\n    print(\"In momentum space, this is expressed as:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 65)\n    print(equation)\n    print(\"-\" * 65)\n    print(\"\\nWhere the terms are defined as:\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 {phi}: The neutral scalar field.\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 {D_op}: The Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, where {D_op} = (-{partial}\\u00b2_\\u03c4 - {nabla}\\u00b2 + m\\u00b2).\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 {phi_tilde}(p, {omega}\\u2099): The Fourier component of the field {phi}.\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 {sum_part}: A sum over all integers n (from -∞ to +∞).\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 p: The d-dimensional spatial momentum.\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 d: The number of spatial dimensions.\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 m: The mass of the field quantum.\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 {omega}\\u2099: The bosonic Matsubara frequencies, defined as {omega}\\u2099 = {2}{pi}n / {beta}.\")\n    print(f\"  \\u2022 {beta}: The inverse temperature, where {beta} = 1/T (in natural units where k_B = 1).\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_inner_product_expression()\n```\n<<<Σ_n ∫ [d^d*p / (2*π)^d] * |ϕ~(p, ω_n)|^2 * (p^2 + ω_n^2 + m^2)>>>"
