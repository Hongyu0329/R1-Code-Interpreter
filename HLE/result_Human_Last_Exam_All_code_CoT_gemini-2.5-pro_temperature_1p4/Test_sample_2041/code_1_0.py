    # Step 1: Analyze the "shallow" constraint and p-free predicates.
    # A shallow expression applies 'p' only to arguments that do not depend on 'p'.

    # must be a constant function, either always returning true or always false.

    # These 'n' expressions are independent, as we can construct a 'p' to yield any
    # combination of truth values for them.
