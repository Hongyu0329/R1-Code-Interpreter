    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Irreducible Representations and Partitions**: The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $S_n$, are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation**: The dimension of the irrep associated with a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula. The formula is:\n    $$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_{ij}(\\lambda)}$$\n    where $Y(\\lambda)$ is the Young diagram of the partition $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}(\\lambda)$ is the hook length of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of the cell in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one for the cell itself.\n\n3.  **Algorithm**: The plan is to:\n    a. Generate all integer partitions of 25.\n    b. For each partition, construct its Young diagram and calculate the product of the hook lengths of all its cells.\n    c. Use the Hook Length Formula to find the dimension of the corresponding irrep.\n    d. Check if the calculated dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    e. Count how many partitions satisfy this condition.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these steps. The script will:\n    a. Contain a helper function to generate all partitions of 25.\n    b. Contain a helper function to calculate the dimension for a given partition.\n    c. Loop through all partitions, check the dimension, and keep a running count.\n    d. As requested, the code will print the details of each irrep that meets the criterion. The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as printing each dimension found.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of irreducible representations of S_25 with a dimension\n    strictly less than 500,000.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_partitions(n):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates all non-increasing integer partitions of n using a recursive generator.\n        A partition is represented as a list of integers.\n        \"\"\"\n        def generate(target, max_val, current_partition):\n            if target == 0:\n                yield list(current_partition)\n                return\n            \n            # The next part can be at most min(target, max_val).\n            for i in range(min(target, max_val), 0, -1):\n                current_partition.append(i)\n                yield from generate(target - i, i, current_partition)\n                current_partition.pop()\n        \n        yield from generate(n, n, [])\n\n    def calculate_dimension(partition, n):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the dimension of an irrep using the Hook Length Formula.\n        \"\"\"\n        n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n        \n        hook_product = 1\n        # Iterate over the cells (i, j) of the Young diagram for the partition.\n        # i is the row index (0-based), j is the column index (0-based).\n        for i in range(len(partition)):\n            for j in range(partition[i]):\n                # Number of cells to the right in the same row.\n                num_right = partition[i] - (j + 1)\n                \n                # Number of cells below in the same column.\n                num_below = 0\n                for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                    if partition[k] > j:\n                        num_below += 1\n                \n                hook_length = num_right + num_below + 1\n                hook_product *= hook_length\n                \n        # The dimension is n! divided by the product of all hook lengths.\n        # Using integer division as the result is always an integer.\n        dimension = n_factorial // hook_product\n        return dimension\n\n    # Main logic starts here.\n    n = 25\n    limit = 500_000\n    \n    count = 0\n    partitions_found = []\n\n    for p in get_partitions(n):\n        dim = calculate_dimension(p, n)\n        if dim < limit:\n            count += 1\n            # Store the partition and its dimension.\n            partitions_found.append((p, dim))\n    \n    # Sort the results by dimension for a clear output.\n    partitions_found.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    print(f\"Found {count} irreducible representations of S_{n} with dimension less than {limit}:\")\n    \n    # Per the instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # we print the dimension for each qualifying representation.\n    for p, dim in partitions_found:\n        print(f\"dim({str(p):<45}) = {dim}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of such irreps is: {count}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<42>>>"
