    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core of the question, which is a piece of film trivia about Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 movie *Solaris*. The question asks to identify a specific character based on their feelings of nostalgia and shame.\n\nThe character who is deeply connected to Earth and his memories is the protagonist, psychologist Kris Kelvin. His colleagues on the space station, particularly the cynical Snaut, notice his longing for Earth. Snaut even says to him, \"You miss the rustling of the leaves.\" This homesickness is a source of internal conflict for Kris, making him feel out of place and perhaps even ashamed of what he perceives as a weakness in the context of space exploration.\n\nTherefore, the correct character is Kris. I will now provide a simple python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the answer to the trivia question\n    about the 1972 film 'Solaris'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth\n    # is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin. This is a central theme of his character arc.\n    answer_map = {\n        \"A\": \"Kris\",\n        \"B\": \"Hari\",\n        \"C\": \"Snaut\",\n        \"D\": \"Sartorius\",\n        \"E\": \"Gibarian\"\n    }\n\n    correct_character = \"Kris\"\n    correct_option = \"A\"\n\n    print(f\"In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris, the character ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is {answer_map[correct_option]}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice {correct_option}.\")\n\nsolve_solaris_trivia()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
