    "This sequence is quite complex, and finding a simple rule that fits all the numbers is challenging. However, after analyzing the transitions, a plausible pattern emerges for the most recent numbers in the sequence. The rule that correctly predicts the last transition (from 2340 to 2352) is that the next number is generated by adding a value derived from the current number's digits. Specifically, you add the product of the non-zero digits divided by the first digit.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown for the last given number, 2352:\n\n1.  **Start with the last number:** `n = 2352`\n2.  **Identify its digits:** The digits are 2, 3, 5, and 2.\n3.  **Identify the first digit:** The first digit is 2.\n4.  **Calculate the product of the non-zero digits:** `2 * 3 * 5 * 2 = 60`.\n5.  **Calculate the value to add:** This value is the product from the previous step divided by the first digit: `60 / 2 = 30`.\n6.  **Calculate the next number:** Add this value to the current number: `2352 + 30 = 2382`.\n\nLet's apply this logic in Python code to confirm the result.\n\n```python\ndef get_next_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in the sequence based on the rule:\n    n + (product of non-zero digits of n) / (first digit of n)\n    \"\"\"\n    s = str(n)\n    \n    # Find the first digit\n    first_digit = int(s[0])\n    \n    # Calculate the product of non-zero digits\n    product_nz = 1\n    for digit in s:\n        if digit != '0':\n            product_nz *= int(digit)\n            \n    # Calculate the value to add\n    value_to_add = product_nz // first_digit\n    \n    # Calculate the next number\n    next_n = n + value_to_add\n    \n    # Print the equation with all the numbers\n    print(f\"The last number is {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The digits of {n} are {', '.join(list(s))}.\")\n    print(f\"The first digit is {first_digit}.\")\n    print(f\"The product of its non-zero digits is {' * '.join([d for d in s if d != '0'])} = {product_nz}.\")\n    print(f\"The value to add is the product divided by the first digit: {product_nz} / {first_digit} = {value_to_add}.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {n} + {value_to_add} = {next_n}\")\n    print(f\"The next number in the sequence is {next_n}.\")\n\n# The last number in the sequence provided by the user\nlast_number = 2352\nget_next_number(last_number)\n\n```\n<<<2382>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
