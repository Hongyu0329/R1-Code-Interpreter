    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe user wants to identify the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\". My plan is to:\n1.  Identify the specific Israeli law that is widely recognized for establishing \"good faith\" as a fundamental legal principle.\n2.  Confirm that this was the first statute to do so in a broad, explicit manner.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores this statute's name in a variable and then prints it to the console, fulfilling the request for a code-based solution.\n4.  Provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_good_faith_statute():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the first Israeli statute\n  to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" as a general principle.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The statute in question is the Contracts (General Part) Law. While earlier laws\n  # may have touched upon similar concepts in specific contexts, this law is\n  # recognized for establishing \"good faith\" as a foundational and overarching\n  # doctrine in Israeli civil law, particularly in sections 12 and 39.\n  statute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n  print(statute_name)\n\nfind_first_good_faith_statute()\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
