# The problem asks for the maximum possible number of digits in a sequence N
# using at most 5 distinct digits, such that every consecutive subsequence of N
# has at least one digit that appears exactly once.

# This is equivalent to finding the maximum length of an Abelian square-free word
# on an alphabet of size k=5. Let's denote this by L(k).

# The known values for k = 1, 2, 3, 4 are:
# L(1) = 1
# L(2) = 3
# L(3) = 7
# L(4) = 17

# There's a recursive construction to find a valid (though not always maximal)
# sequence for k symbols from a maximal sequence for k-1 symbols.
# If S_{k-1} is a maximal sequence of length L(k-1), then the sequence
# S_k = S_{k-1} + str(k) + S_{k-1} is a valid sequence for k symbols.
# The length of this new sequence gives a lower bound for L(k):
# L(k) >= 2 * L(k-1) + 1

# We want to find L(5). We can use the known value of L(4) = 17.
L_4 = 17

# Using the formula, we can calculate a lower bound for L(5).
# As the exact value of L(5) is an open research problem, this provable
# lower bound is the most reasonable answer.
L_5 = 2 * L_4 + 1

# Print the calculation step-by-step.
first_number = 2
second_number = L_4
third_number = 1
result = L_5

print(f"{first_number} * {second_number} + {third_number} = {result}")
