    "My plan is to first understand the technical characteristics of a \"reverse turn\" in each of the listed ballroom dances. The key is to identify the dance where the fundamental technique is so strict that adding extra rotation (overturning) would inherently violate its core principles.\n\n1.  **Analyze Swing Dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances are characterized by \"swing,\" \"sway,\" \"rise and fall,\" and \"Continuous Body Movement\" (CBM). The body's rotation and momentum are used to move the feet. While a standard amount of turn is prescribed for a reverse turn, the very nature of swing and momentum makes it physically possible to turn more (overturn), even if it's considered poor form or an advanced variation. The technique does not create a hard stop.\n\n2.  **Analyze European Tango:** Tango is fundamentally different. Its technique is based on a \"staccato\" action. It has no rise and fall, no sway, and does not use CBM in the same way as swing dances. Movement is direct and clipped. A reverse turn in Tango involves specific foot placements and sharp swivels. Attempting to add continuous rotation to \"overturn\" the figure would introduce swing and momentum, which are completely contrary to the core, non-progressive, staccato nature of Tango. Doing so would mean you are no longer dancing the Tango technique.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The European Tango is the only dance on the list where the fundamental technique makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding that technique.\n\nI will write a Python script that explains this reasoning and then presents the answer. To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an \"equation\", I will represent the choices as variables, assign a value of 1 to the correct choice and 0 to the others to simulate a selection process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the technical characteristics of the reverse turn in different ballroom dances.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The core distinction is between swing-based dances and the staccato action of Tango.\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
