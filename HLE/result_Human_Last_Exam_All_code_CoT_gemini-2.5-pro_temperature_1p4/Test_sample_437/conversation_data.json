    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Request:** The goal is to evaluate the quantum mechanical integral \\(\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle\\). This is known as a one-center nuclear attraction integral. The orbitals \\(\\phi_i\\) and \\(\\phi_j\\) are specified as \\(1s\\) Slater-type orbitals (STOs). The indices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) suggest that the orbitals may have different exponents, which we'll call \\(\\zeta_i\\) and \\(\\zeta_j\\).\n2.  **Mathematical Formulation:**\n    *   First, I will state the normalized mathematical form of a \\(1s\\) STO:\n        \\[ \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}; \\zeta) = \\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\]\n    *   Next, I will set up the integral in three-dimensional space using spherical coordinates, where the volume element is \\(d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi\\).\n        \\[ I = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}; \\zeta_i) \\frac{1}{r} \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}; \\zeta_j) \\, r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\varphi \\, d\\theta \\, dr \\]\n3.  **Analytical Derivation:**\n    *   I will solve the integral analytically. The integration over the angular parts (\\(\\theta, \\varphi\\)) is straightforward and yields a factor of \\(4\\pi\\).\n    *   The remaining radial integral is a standard form (related to the Gamma function), which can be solved to yield a closed-form expression.\n    *   The final analytical formula is:\n        \\[ \\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle = \\frac{4(\\zeta_i \\zeta_j)^{3/2}}{(\\zeta_i + \\zeta_j)^2} \\]\n4.  **Python Implementation:**\n    *   I will write a Python script that defines a function to compute the integral's value using the derived analytical formula for given exponents \\(\\zeta_i\\) and \\(\\zeta_j\\).\n    *   To demonstrate the use of coding skills for verification, the script will also compute the integral numerically using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function.\n    *   The script will print both the analytical and numerical results for a set of example exponents, showing that they match. It will also print the final equation with the numbers filled in, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef evaluate_1s_nuclear_attraction(zeta_i, zeta_j):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the nuclear attraction integral <phi_i| 1/r |phi_j> for two\n    1s Slater-Type Orbitals (STOs) centered on the same nucleus.\n\n    Args:\n        zeta_i (float): The orbital exponent of the first 1s orbital (phi_i).\n        zeta_j (float): The orbital exponent of the second 1s orbital (phi_j).\n\n    The integral is defined as:\n    I = Integral( phi_i*(r) * (1/r) * phi_j(r) * d_tau ) over all space.\n\n    The normalized 1s STO is: phi(r) = (zeta^3 / pi)^(1/2) * exp(-zeta*r)\n\n    The integral can be solved analytically, yielding the formula:\n    I = 4 * (zeta_i * zeta_j)^(3/2) / (zeta_i + zeta_j)^2\n\n    This function calculates the result using the analytical formula and also\n    verifies it by performing numerical integration.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Analytical Calculation ---\n    numerator = 4 * (zeta_i * zeta_j)**1.5\n    denominator = (zeta_i + zeta_j)**2\n    analytical_result = numerator / denominator\n\n    # --- Numerical Calculation for Verification ---\n    # The full integrand in spherical coordinates, after integrating over angles, is:\n    # Integrand(r) = phi_i(r) * (1/r) * phi_j(r) * 4*pi*r^2\n    # phi_i(r) = (zeta_i^3 / pi)^0.5 * exp(-zeta_i*r)\n    # phi_j(r) = (zeta_j^3 / pi)^0.5 * exp(-zeta_j*r)\n    # Substituting these in simplifies the integrand to:\n    # Integrand(r) = 4 * (zeta_i*zeta_j)^1.5 * r * exp(-(zeta_i+zeta_j)*r)\n    \n    radial_integrand = lambda r: 4 * (zeta_i * zeta_j)**1.5 * r * np.exp(-(zeta_i + zeta_j) * r)\n    numerical_result, error = quad(radial_integrand, 0, np.inf)\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(f\"Evaluating the integral <phi_i| 1/r |phi_j> for 1s STOs with exponents:\")\n    print(f\"zeta_i = {zeta_i}\")\n    print(f\"zeta_j = {zeta_j}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"ANALYTICAL RESULT:\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the integral is:\")\n    # Printing each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"I = {4.0} * ({zeta_i} * {zeta_j})**{1.5} / ({zeta_i} + {zeta_j})**{2.0}\")\n    print(f\"Analytical Value = {analytical_result}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"NUMERICAL VERIFICATION:\")\n    print(\"Numerical Value = {}\".format(numerical_result))\n    print(\"Absolute Error in Numerical Integration = {}\".format(error))\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # In the special case where zeta_i = zeta_j = zeta, the formula simplifies to zeta.\n    if zeta_i == zeta_j:\n        print(f\"Note: For the case zeta_i = zeta_j = {zeta_i}, the integral simplifies to just zeta, which is {analytical_result}.\")\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\n# You can change these values to evaluate the integral for different orbitals.\n# Case 1: Different exponents\nprint(\"### General Case (zeta_i != zeta_j) ###\")\nzeta_i_val_1 = 2.0\nzeta_j_val_1 = 1.5\nresult_1 = evaluate_1s_nuclear_attraction(zeta_i_val_1, zeta_j_val_1)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Case 2: Identical exponents (e.g., for the expectation value <phi|1/r|phi>)\nprint(\"### Special Case (zeta_i = zeta_j) ###\")\n# For a Hydrogen atom, zeta is 1.0.
