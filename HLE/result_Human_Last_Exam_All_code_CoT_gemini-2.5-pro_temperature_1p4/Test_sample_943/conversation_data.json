    "Here is a plan to find the value of K:\n1.  Let the given tensor be $T(x,y,z)$. We can express it as the difference of two tensors, $T = P - J$, where $P(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ and $J(x,y,z) = 1$ is the all-ones tensor.\n2.  The slice rank is sub-additive, meaning $\\text{srank}(A+B) \\le \\text{srank}(A) + \\text{srank}(B)$. Also, for any tensor $A$, $\\text{srank}(A) \\ge \\text{srank}(A-B) - \\text{srank}(B)$.\n3.  First, we will determine the slice rank of the tensor $P$. By expanding the product with respect to the variables $x_i$, we can express $P$ as a sum of slices:\n    $P(x,y,z) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{1,...,n\\}} \\left( \\prod_{i \\in S} x_i \\right) \\left( \\prod_{j \\in \\{1,...,n\\}\\setminus S} (y_j + z_j) \\right)$.\n    Each term in this sum is a product of a function of $x$ and a function of $(y, z)$, which corresponds to a \"slice\" of the tensor. There are $2^n$ such terms (one for each subset $S$), so this decomposition shows that $\\text{srank}(P) \\le 2^n$.\n4.  By showing that these $2^n$ slice functions are linearly independent, we can establish that the slice rank of $P$ is exactly $2^n$.\n5.  The tensor $J$ is the all-ones tensor, which has a slice rank of 1.\n6.  Using the properties of slice rank, we can bound the slice rank of $T$: $\\text{srank}(P) - \\text{srank}(J) \\le \\text{srank}(T) \\le \\text{srank}(P) + \\text{srank}(J)$. This gives us $2^n - 1 \\le \\text{srank}(T) \\le 2^n + 1$.\n7.  For large $n$, the asymptotic behavior of $\\text{srank}(T)$ is therefore $2^n$.\n8.  The problem provides the formula for the slice rank as $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The $e^{o(n)}$ term accounts for sub-exponential factors, which do not affect the main exponential base.\n9.  By equating the exponential bases of the two expressions for the slice rank, we get the equation $2 = 3 / 2^K$.\n10. Finally, we solve this equation to find the value of $K$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_for_k():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to find the value of K based on the provided tensor slice rank formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1-7: From the analysis, the slice rank of the tensor grows as 2^n for large n.\n    # The exponential base of this growth is 2.\n    calculated_base = 2\n\n    # Step 8: The problem gives the slice rank formula with a base of (3 / 2^K).\n    # The given base is a symbolic expression involving K.\n    # Given base = 3 / (2**K)\n    given_base_numerator = 3\n    given_base_denominator_base = 2\n\n    # Step 9: Equate the bases to find K.\n    print(\"The final equation to solve for K is derived by equating the bases of the exponential growth of the slice rank.\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: {calculated_base} = {given_base_numerator} / ({given_base_denominator_base}**K)\")\n    \n    # Step 10: Solve the equation for K.\n    # 2 = 3 / (2**K)\n    # 2 * (2**K) = 3\n    # 2**(K + 1) = 3\n    # K + 1 = log2(3)\n    # K = log2(3) - 1\n    # K = log2(3/2)\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep-by-step solution of the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{calculated_base} * ({given_base_denominator_base}**K) = {given_base_numerator}\")\n    print(f\"{given_base_denominator_base}**(K + 1) = {given_base_numerator}\")\n    print(f\"K + 1 = log{given_base_denominator_base}({given_base_numerator})\")\n    print(f\"K = log{given_base_denominator_base}({given_base_numerator}) - 1\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to K = log{given_base_denominator_base}({given_base_numerator}/{given_base_denominator_base})\")\n\n    k_value = math.log2(3.0 / 2.0)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe symbolic value for K is log2(3/2).\")\n    print(f\"The numerical value for K is approximately: {k_value}\")\n\nsolve_for_k()\n```\n<<<log2(3/2)>>>"
