    "An analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime can be developed by analyzing the behavior of the integrand near its singularity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the formula:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Contribution**: The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)} dx$, with $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For a very small positive $\\epsilon$, the denominator becomes small only when $g(x)$ is close to zero. Since $g(0) = 0$ and $g(x)$ is an increasing function for $x>0$, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n2.  **Approximate the Denominator**: Near $x=0$, the function $g(x)$ is well-approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. Thus, we can write $g(x) \\approx 9.0x^{5.0}$.\n3.  **Approximate the Integral**: With the approximation for $g(x)$, the integral becomes $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$. Because the integrand decays rapidly as $x$ increases, the contribution from larger $x$ is negligible. We can extend the upper limit of integration to infinity without introducing significant error, which simplifies the calculation. This gives $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n4.  **Solve the Approximated Integral**: The approximated integral is a standard form that can be solved analytically. An integral of the form $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + c x^p} dx$ evaluates to the form $C \\epsilon^{-a}$. The exponent is given by $a = (p-1)/p$ and the coefficient by $C = \\frac{\\pi}{p \\cdot c^{1/p} \\sin(\\pi/p)}$.\n5.  **Calculate the Constants**: In our problem, the dominant term has coefficient $c=9.0$ and power $p=5.0$.\n    *   The exponent is $a = (5.0 - 1.0) / 5.0 = 4.0 / 5.0 = 0.8$.\n    *   The coefficient is $C = \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical values for $C$ and $a$ and presents the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Parameters from the approximated integral\n# I(epsilon) is approximated by the integral of 1 / (epsilon + c * x^p)\n# In this problem, c*x^p is the dominant term for x -> 0, which is 9.0 * x^5.0\nc = 9.0\np = 5.0\n\n# The analytical solution for the integral is C * epsilon^(-a)\n# Calculate the exponent 'a'\nexponent_a = (p - 1) / p\n\n# Calculate the coefficient 'C'\n# C = (1 / c^(1/p)) * (pi / (p * sin(pi/p)))\ncoeff_C = (1 / (c**(1/p))) * (math.pi / (p * math.sin(math.pi / p)))\n\n# Print the resulting analytical formula with the calculated numbers\nprint(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\nprint(\"I(epsilon) ~= C * epsilon**(-a)\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculated values for the parameters:\")\nprint(f\"c (coefficient of dominant term) = {c}\")\nprint(f\"p (power of dominant term) = {p}\")\nprint(f\"a = (p-1)/p = ({p}-1)/{p} = {exponent_a}\")\nprint(f\"C = (pi / (p * c**(1/p) * sin(pi/p))) = {coeff_C}\")\nprint(\"\\nThus, the final approximate equation is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) ~= {coeff_C} * epsilon**(-{exponent_a})\")\n```\n<<<0.6888423601551347>>>"
