    fact_1 = "1. The School of American Ballet, representing the Balanchine technique, is uniquely famous for its pirouette preparation from the fourth position. This preparation characteristically features dancers' arms held straight and open in an 'allongé' position, combined with a deep plié (bent knees)."

    fact_2 = "2. The Paris Opera Ballet School, representing the French school, is the historical foundation from which the Balanchine technique evolved. The French style places a strong emphasis on elegant and elongated lines, and 'allongé' is a fundamental concept in its vocabulary. While it uses various arm preparations, its stylistic connection makes it the most fitting partner to the School of American Ballet."

    fact_3 = "3. The Royal Ballet School (English style), the Vaganova Academy (Russian style), and La Scala (Italian style) are all generally known for using more rounded arm positions in their standard pirouette preparations, rather than the distinct, straight-armed allongé position described in the question."
