    print("Step 1: Understand the drug's mechanism.")
    print("Acetazolamide reduces fluid production in two key areas by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.")
    print("  - In the brain: It decreases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, which lowers intracranial pressure.")
    print("  - In the eye: It decreases aqueous humor production, which lowers intraocular pressure (IOP).")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the patient's situation.")
    print("The patient's idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is in remission. This means the primary problem (high intracranial pressure) has resolved.")
    print("However, the patient continues to take acetazolamide.")
    print("")

    print("Step 3: Determine the effect on the specific test.")
    print("The question asks about the result of an intraocular pressure (IOP) test.")
    print("Even though the intracranial pressure is normal, the acetazolamide is still active in the body.")
    print("Its effect on the eye is independent of the condition in the brain.")
    print("Therefore, the drug will continue to reduce the production of aqueous humor in the eye.")
    print("")

    print("Step 4: Conclude the finding.")
    print("A reduction in aqueous humor directly causes a reduction in the pressure inside the eye.")
    print("The expected result on an intraocular pressure test is an abnormally low pressure.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice B.")
