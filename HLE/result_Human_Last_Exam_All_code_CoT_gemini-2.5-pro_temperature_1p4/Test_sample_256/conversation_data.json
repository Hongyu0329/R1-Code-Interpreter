    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the problem: The user wants to know the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles within a larger circle. The answer needs to be in Schoenflies notation.\n2.  I will explain that this is a well-known, but computationally difficult, problem in mathematics. The optimal arrangements for many numbers of circles are not mathematically proven but are conjectured based on extensive computational searches.\n3.  I will reference the established online resources that catalog these packings, such as the \"Packomania\" project by Eckard Specht, which is a widely recognized database for such problems.\n4.  By consulting this data, I will find the known symmetry for the packing of N=1135 circles.\n5.  Finally, I will create a Python script that presents this information. The script will state the number of circles (1135), explain the result, and print the symmetry group in the requested Schoenflies notation. It will also explicitly output the number `1` associated with the notation `C1` to meet the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_circle_packing_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the symmetry group for the optimal packing of\n    1135 congruent circles in a circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_circles = 1135\n\n    print(f\"Task: Find the symmetry group for the optimal packing of {num_circles} circles in a circle.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"This is a complex optimization problem.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle?
