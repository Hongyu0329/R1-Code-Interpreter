# The problem requires finding the bounds for a real number 't'.
# Our analysis has led to a single equation that 't' must satisfy.

# Let the range of the sums be R = [a, b], where a = -2 and b = 2*t.
# The condition that for any s in R, 1/s is also in R,
# for a negative interval R, requires that a*b = 1.

# Define the variables
t = sympy.Symbol('t')

# Define the lower and upper bounds of the sum's range
a = -2
b = 2 * t

# The derived equation is a * b = 1
equation = sympy.Eq(a * b, 1)

# Solve the equation for t
solution = sympy.solve(equation, t)

# The solution is a list, we take the first element.
t_value = solution[0]

# For a single point solution set, the lower and upper bounds are the same.
lower_bound = float(t_value)
upper_bound = float(t_value)

# Output the explanation and the result.
