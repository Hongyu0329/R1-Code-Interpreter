    "The problem asks for a specific Hurwitz number, which counts certain geometric objects called ramified covers of the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{P}^1$. This geometric problem can be translated into a purely combinatorial one involving the symmetric group $S_d$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Translate to a Combinatorial Problem:** The number of ramified covers of degree $d=7$ with the given ramification profiles is related to the number of ways to write the identity permutation in $S_7$ as a product of four permutations, $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = \\text{id}$, where each $\\sigma_i$ has a specified cycle structure (partition). Let's denote the number of such tuples $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ by $C(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3, \\mu_4)$.\n\n2.  **Use Character Theory:** This number $C$ can be computed using the character theory of the symmetric group $S_7$. The formula, sometimes called the Frobenius-Mednykh formula, is:\n    $$C(\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_k) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k |C_{\\mu_i}|}{(d!)^{k-1}} \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k \\chi(\\mu_i)}{\\chi(1)^{k-2}}$$\n    where the sum is over all irreducible characters $\\chi$ of $S_d$.\n    *   $d=7$ is the degree.\n    *   $k=4$ is the number of branch points.\n    *   $\\mu_1=(4,3), \\mu_2=(5,2), \\mu_3=\\mu_4=(2,1^5)$ are the partitions corresponding to the ramification profiles.\n    *   $|C_\\mu|$ is the size of the conjugacy class of permutations with cycle structure $\\mu$.\n    *   $\\chi(\\mu)$ is the value of the character $\\chi$ on the class $C_\\mu$.\n    *   $\\chi(1)$ is the dimension of the irreducible representation corresponding to $\\chi$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Hurwitz Number:** The Hurwitz number $H_0(\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_k)$ that counts the covers is given by $H_0 = \\frac{C(\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_k)}{d!}$, assuming the automorphism group of a generic cover is trivial (which is standard). So we have:\n    $$H_0 = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k |C_{\\mu_i}|}{(d!)^{k}} \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k \\chi(\\mu_i)}{\\chi(1)^{k-2}}$$\n\n4.  **Execute with Python:** The calculation involves the character table of $S_7$, which is large and complex. I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform this calculation. The code will:\n    *   Define the parameters $d, k$ and the partitions $\\mu_i$.\n    *   Use `sympy` to get the character table of $S_7$.\n    *   Calculate the sizes of the relevant conjugacy classes.\n    *   Compute the sum over all irreducible characters.\n    *   Combine these parts to find $C$ and then $H_0$.\n    *   Print all the relevant numbers to show the calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, factorial\nfrom sympy.combinatorics import SymmetricGroup\n\ndef solve_hurwitz_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hurwitz number for the specified ramification profiles\n    using the character theory of the symmetric group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
