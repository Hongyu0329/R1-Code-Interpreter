    "My plan is to identify the specific verses (bayt) in the famous didactic poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets. I will use a Python script to present this information clearly.\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Verse:** The section dedicated to the prophets begins with a verse that introduces the topic, stating that knowing the details of twenty-five prophets is a requirement. According to the most common numbering of the poem, this is verse 28.\n2.  **Identify the Verses with Names:** Following the introduction, the poem lists the names of the prophets over several verses. I will pinpoint the exact verses that contain the names.\n3.  **Identify the Ending Verse:** I will find the last verse that contains a prophet's name, which concludes the list. This is verse 32, which mentions Prophet Isa (Jesus) and Prophet Muhammad.\n4.  **Construct the Python Script:** The script will define this range of verses. It will then print a clear explanation and display each verse number along with its Arabic text and English translation for the user's benefit, fulfilling the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation.\"\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses_in_aqeedah():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and displays the verses (bayt) from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that mention the names of the 25 prophets in Islam.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The verses are numbered according to the most common editions of the poem.\n    start_bayt_section = 28\n    end_bayt_section = 32\n\n    # A dictionary to hold the verses with their Arabic text and English translation.\n    prophet_verses = {\n        28: {\n            \"arabic\": \"تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ❊ كُلٌّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\",\n            \"translation\": \"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding; upon every responsible person, so realize this and seize the benefit.\"\n        },\n        29: {\n            \"arabic\": \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ ❊ صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"translation\": \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih, and Ibrahim; each one is to be followed.\"\n        },\n        30: {\n            \"arabic\": \"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ❊ يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n            \"translation\": \"Lut, Isma'il, and Ishaq, as well as Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub who was taken as an example.\"\n        },\n        31: {\n            \"arabic\": \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ❊ ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"translation\": \"Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, and al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman who followed.\"\n        },\n        32: {\n            \"arabic\": \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ❊ عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\",\n            \"translation\": \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (Muhammad), the seal of the prophets—so leave misguidance.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the section about the 25 prophets is mentioned from bayt (verse) {start_bayt_section} to {end_bayt_section}.\\n\")\n    print(\"The introductory verse states the number, and the subsequent verses list the names:\\n\")\n\n    # Loop through and print each verse number and its content\n    for bayt_num in range(start_bayt_section, end_bayt_section + 1):\n        verse = prophet_verses[bayt_num]\n        print(f\"Bayt {bayt_num}:\")\n        print(f\"  Arabic:      {verse['arabic']}\")\n        print(f\"  Translation: {verse['translation']}\\n\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_prophet_verses_in_aqeedah()\n```\n<<<28 to 32>>>"
