    "To answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Luxor Obelisk Locations:** There are two Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n2.  **Scan Best Picture Winners:** I will go through the list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners chronologically.\n3.  **Cross-Reference Locations:** I will look for the first winner that is set in either Paris or Luxor and features a scene depicting the corresponding obelisk.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Movie:** Films set in Paris appear much earlier on the winners' list than any set in Luxor. Early candidates include *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), *An American in Paris* (1951), and *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956).\n5.  **Verify On-Screen Depiction:** While *The Life of Emile Zola* is set in Paris, it does not prominently feature the obelisk. *An American in Paris*, however, features a clear and famous depiction of the Place de la Concorde obelisk during its climactic ballet sequence. As this predates other Paris-set winners, it is the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this chronological search to find the first winner that matches the criteria.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the research process to find the first\n    Best Picture winner that depicted a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n    The Luxor Obelisks are located in Luxor, Egypt, and Paris, France.\n    We will analyze a curated list of Best Picture winners set in\n    these locations in chronological order.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data structure: (Year, \"Title\", \"Location\", Depicts_Obelisk_Bool)\n    # We list potential candidates chronologically.\n    relevant_winners = [\n        (1937, \"The Life of Emile Zola\", \"Paris\", False),\n        (1951, \"An American in Paris\", \"Paris\", True),\n        (1956, \"Around the World in 80 Days\", \"Paris\", True),\n        (1958, \"Gigi\", \"Paris\", True),\n        # Note: No earlier winner is set in or depicts Luxor, Egypt.\n        # 'The English Patient' (1996) is set partially in Egypt but\n        # does not depict the obelisk in Luxor.\n    ]\n\n    first_winner = None\n\n    # Iterate through the list to find the first movie that depicts the obelisk\n    for year, title, location, depicts_obelisk in relevant_winners:\n        if depicts_obelisk:\n            first_winner = (year, title)\n            break  # Stop at the first chronological match\n\n    if first_winner:\n        winner_year, winner_title = first_winner\n        print(f\"Searching for the first Best Picture winner to show a Luxor Obelisk...\")\n        print(f\"The obelisk is located in Paris, France.\")\n        print(f\"The first film to win Best Picture and depict the obelisk is '{winner_title}'.\")\n        print(f\"It won the award for the year {winner_year}.\")\n    else:\n        # This part of the code will not be reached with the current data.\n        print(\"No winner matching the criteria was found in the data set.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
