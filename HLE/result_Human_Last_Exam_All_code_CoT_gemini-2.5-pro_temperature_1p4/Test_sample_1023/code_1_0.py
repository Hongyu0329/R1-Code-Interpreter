# Plan:
# 1. Define the equation for the morphospecies extinction rate (mu_m) based on the events that cause it.
# 2. Interpret the problem's core assumption to establish a relationship between the different rates.
# 3. Substitute this relationship back into the original equation to solve for the factor.
# 4. Print the final result, including the numbers in the final equation as requested.

# The extinction rate for a morphospecies, mu_m, is the sum of rates of:
# 1. True biological extinction (rate = mu_e)
# 2. Extinction from bifurcating speciation (rate = 0.5 * lambda_e)
# 3. Extinction from anagenetic replacement (rate = sigma)
# This gives the equation: mu_m = mu_e + 0.5 * lambda_e + sigma

# The assumption "all processes occur at the same rates" is interpreted as equating the rate of
# true biological extinction with the rate of taxonomic pseudo-extinction.
# Rate of true extinction = mu_e
# Rate of taxonomic pseudo-extinction = (0.5 * lambda_e) + sigma
# This gives the key relationship: mu_e = 0.5 * lambda_e + sigma

# Now, we substitute this relationship into the equation for mu_m:
# mu_m = mu_e + (0.5 * lambda_e + sigma)
# mu_m = mu_e + (mu_e)
# This simplifies to our final relationship between the two extinction rates.
