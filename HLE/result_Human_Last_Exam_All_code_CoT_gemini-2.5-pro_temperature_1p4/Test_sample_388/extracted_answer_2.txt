The pharmacist could counsel Allison on a potential drug interaction and a side effect. The Fluoxetine (20mg) she is taking can increase the risk of bleeding when combined with the aspirin in Excedrin. For future headaches, it would be safer to use a product with just acetaminophen, like Tylenol. Additionally, new or worsening headaches can be a side effect of her birth control, Junel Fe (1.5/30mg). She should monitor the headache and contact her doctor if it persists or becomes severe, to rule out any more serious issues.
