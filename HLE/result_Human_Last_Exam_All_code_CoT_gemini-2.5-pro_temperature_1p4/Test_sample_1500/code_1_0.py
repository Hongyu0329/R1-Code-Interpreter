    Solves a series of true/false questions about coadjoint orbits of compact semisimple Lie groups.

    # (a) True or false: Every coadjoint orbit admits a compatible complex structure, making it a K채hler manifold.
    # A coadjoint orbit O_lambda of a compact semisimple Lie group G is diffeomorphic to a generalized flag manifold G/P.
    # Generalized flag manifolds are projective algebraic varieties.
    # Every projective variety is a K채hler manifold. The Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau form provides the K채hler form.
    answer_a = "True"

    # (b) For G = SU(n), is the second Betti number b_2(O_lambda) always given by n - 1?
    # This is not always true. The value of b_2 depends on the stabilizer of lambda.
    # If lambda is regular, the orbit is the full flag manifold SU(n)/T, and b_2 = rank(SU(n)) = n - 1.
    # However, if lambda is singular, the orbit can be different.
    # Example: For G = SU(3), n=3. The formula gives b_2 = 2.
    # Consider a singular orbit corresponding to the Grassmannian Gr(2, C^3), which is isomorphic to the complex projective plane P^2.
    # The second Betti number of P^2 is b_2(P^2) = 1.
    # Since 1 != 2, the statement is false.
    answer_b = "No"

    # (c) If O_lambda is endowed with a natural equivariant K채hler metric, must the corresponding equivariant
    # cohomology ring be isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a GKM graph?
    # This is not always true. A manifold must satisfy the GKM conditions to be a GKM manifold.
    # One condition is that the weights of the tangential representation of the torus T at each fixed point must be pairwise linearly independent.
    # Consider the coadjoint orbit for a regular element, which is the full flag manifold G/T.
    # For G = SU(3) (rank 2), the tangent weights at a T-fixed point are the roots of the Lie algebra su(3).
    # If alpha is a root, -alpha is also a root. The pair {alpha, -alpha} is linearly dependent.
    # Thus, the full flag manifold for SU(n) with n >= 3 is not a GKM manifold.
    answer_c = "No"
