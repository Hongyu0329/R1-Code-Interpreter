    "The security of cryptographic systems is assessed differently when considering attacks by classical computers versus quantum computers.\n\n**Classical vs. Quantum Attacks on Symmetric Keys**\n\n1.  **Classical Brute-Force Attack:** For a symmetric key of length `N` bits, there are `2^N` possible keys. A classical computer would, on average, have to try half of these (`2^(N-1)`) to find the correct one. This is known as a brute-force attack. A 128-bit key is considered secure against classical computers because `2^128` is an astronomically large number of possibilities to check.\n\n2.  **Quantum Brute-Force Attack (Grover's Algorithm):** A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could use Grover's algorithm to attack symmetric ciphers. This algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems like finding a key. Instead of `2^N` operations, it would only require approximately `sqrt(2^N)` or `2^(N/2)` operations.\n\n**Calculating the Required Key Length**\n\nTo maintain a security level of 128 bits (the current standard) against a quantum computer, the key length `N` must be large enough so that after the quantum speedup, the remaining security is still at least 128 bits.\n\n*   Effective Quantum Security = `N / 2`\n*   We want: `Effective Quantum Security >= 128`\n*   So, `N / 2 >= 128`\n*   Therefore, `N >= 128 * 2`\n*   `N >= 256`\n\nThis means to achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long. This is why AES-256 is commonly recommended as a \"quantum-resistant\" symmetric cipher.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimum required length.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against\n    a quantum computer attack using Grover's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The target security level for modern cryptography (in bits).\n    # This means an attacker would need to perform roughly 2^128 operations.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup, effectively halving the\n    # bit security of a symmetric key. So, the speedup factor on the bit length is 2.\n    grover_speedup_factor = 2\n\n    # The equation to find the required key length (N) is:\n    # N / grover_speedup_factor >= target_security_level\n    # N >= target_security_level * grover_speedup_factor\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * grover_speedup_factor\n\n    print(f\"Goal: Achieve a security level of {target_security_level} bits against a quantum computer.\")\n    print(f\"Quantum attack (Grover's Algorithm) reduces key strength by a factor of {grover_speedup_factor} (quadratic speedup).\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Required Key Length >= {target_security_level} (Target Security) * {grover_speedup_factor} (Quantum Speedup Factor)\")\n    print(f\"Required Key Length >= {required_key_length} bits\")\n    print(\"\\nThus, the minimum symmetric key length to be considered secure is 256 bits.\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
