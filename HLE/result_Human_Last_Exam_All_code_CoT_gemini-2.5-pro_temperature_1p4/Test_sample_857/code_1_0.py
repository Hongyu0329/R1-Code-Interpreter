def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function solves the given topology problem regarding coastal points
    in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.

    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of points
    where a hereditarily decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal. Let this
    set be denoted by NC(X).

    Step 1: Find an upper bound for the cardinality of NC(X).
    A known theorem in continuum theory states that for any hereditarily
    decomposable continuum X, the cardinality of its set of non-coastal points
    is at most 2.
    So, |NC(X)| <= 2.

    Step 2: Find an example that achieves this upper bound.
    Consider the standard 'sin(1/x)' continuum. This space is hereditarily
    decomposable. It is a known result that for this specific continuum,
    the set of non-coastal points consists of exactly two points (the endpoints
    of the limit segment on the y-axis).
    For this example, |NC(X)| = 2.

    Step 3: Conclude the result.
    Since the maximum cardinality is at most 2, and we have an example
    where the cardinality is exactly 2, the largest possible cardinality is 2.
