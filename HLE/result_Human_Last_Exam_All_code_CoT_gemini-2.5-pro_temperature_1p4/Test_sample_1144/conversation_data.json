    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Constants and Given Values**: We need the reduced Planck constant (ħ), the Bohr radius (a₀), and the given uncertainty in position (Δx).\n2.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**: We will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so the equation becomes Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n3.  **Calculate the Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p)**: For the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum (L) is quantized as L = 1 * ħ. Since angular momentum is also given by L = p * r (where r is the orbital radius), we have p * r₁ = ħ. For the first orbit, the radius r₁ is the Bohr radius, a₀. Therefore, the momentum is p = ħ / a₀.\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio**: The required ratio is Δp / p. We will substitute the expressions from the previous steps: (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀). This simplifies to a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n5.  **Code the Solution**: Write a Python script to define the constants, perform the calculations, and print the result in a clear format, showing each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
