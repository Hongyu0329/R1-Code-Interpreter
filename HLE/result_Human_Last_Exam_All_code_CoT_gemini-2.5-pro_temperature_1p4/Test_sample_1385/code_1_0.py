# The given enclitics are: бы, же, еси, бо, мя
# The correct order is determined by the grammatical rules of Old Russian.
# The general sequence is: conjunctions -> pronouns -> conditional particle -> verbal clitics.

# 1. бо (conjunction "for")
# 2. же (particle "but", "and", emphasis)
# 3. мя (pronominal clitic "me", accusative)
# 4. бы (conditional particle "would")
# 5. еси (verbal clitic "you are", 2nd p. sg.)

# Storing the enclitics in their correct order
correct_order = ['бо', 'же', 'мя', 'бы', 'еси']

# Printing each element in the final sequence
print("The correct order for the enclitics is:")
print(' '.join(correct_order))
