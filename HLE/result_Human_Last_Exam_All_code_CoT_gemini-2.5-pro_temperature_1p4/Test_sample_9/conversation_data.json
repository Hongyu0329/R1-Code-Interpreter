    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we identify the space $X$ with a quotient of Lie groups. A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ can be described by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which can be represented as the columns of a matrix $g \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The area of the fundamental parallelogram is $|\\det(g)|$. The condition of unit area means $g \\in \\text{SL}^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{g \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) : \\det(g) = \\pm 1\\}$. Two bases $g_1, g_2$ define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix $\\gamma \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $g_2 = g_1\\gamma$. Therefore, the moduli space is the quotient $X = \\text{SL}^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  We relate this space to the moduli space of *oriented* lattices, $X_o = \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. An oriented lattice has a basis with a fixed orientation, e.g., $\\det(g) = +1$. The space $X$ is for unoriented lattices. An unoriented lattice can be obtained from an oriented one by identifying it with its orientation-reversed counterpart. This identification is realized by the action of an orientation-reversing element, for instance $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\text{GL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The space $X$ is the quotient of $X_o$ by the involution $\\phi: X_o \\to X_o$ defined by $\\phi([g]_{\\text{SLZ}}) = [gM]_{\\text{SLZ}}$.\n\n3.  The involution $\\phi$ has no fixed points, because a fixed point $[g]$ would mean $gM = g\\gamma$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which would imply $M = \\gamma$, but $\\det(M) = -1 \\neq 1$. Thus, the projection $p: X_o \\to X$ is a 2-sheeted covering map.\n\n4.  We can compute the homology of the quotient space $X=X_o/\\phi$ using the long exact sequence associated with the mapping cone of the chain map $(1-\\phi_\\#)$, which is:\n    $$ \\dots \\to H_k(X_o) \\xrightarrow{1-\\phi_*} H_k(X_o) \\to H_k(X) \\to H_{k-1}(X_o) \\to \\dots $$\n    For $k=1$, this gives the exact sequence:\n    $$ H_1(X_o) \\xrightarrow{1-\\phi_*} H_1(X_o) \\to H_1(X) \\to H_0(X_o) \\xrightarrow{1-\\phi_*} H_0(X_o) \\to \\dots $$\n\n5.  We need to know the homology groups of $X_o$ and the induced maps $\\phi_*$.\n    *   $X_o = \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold. It is a known result that its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(X_o) = \\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(X_o, \\mathbb{Z}) = (\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z}))_{ab}$. This is known to be the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $X_o$ is path-connected, so $H_0(X_o, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $\\phi: [g] \\to [gM]$ induces an automorphism on $\\pi_1(X_o)$ by conjugation with $M$, i.e., $\\gamma \\mapsto M\\gamma M^{-1}$. On the generators $T=\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$ and $S=\\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}$ of $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, this conjugation acts as $T \\mapsto T^{-1}$ and $S \\mapsto S^{-1}$. On the abelianization $H_1(X_o) = \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, this automorphism sends every element to its inverse, which corresponds to multiplication by $-1$. So, $\\phi_*: H_1(X_o) \\to H_1(X_o)$ is multiplication by $-1$.\n    *   The map $\\phi$ is a homeomorphism on a path-connected space, so the induced map $\\phi_*: H_0(X_o) \\to H_0(X_o)$ is the identity map on $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n6.  Now we substitute this information into the long exact sequence:\n    $$ \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{1-(-1)} \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{1-1} \\mathbb{Z} $$\n    $$ \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 0} \\mathbb{Z} $$\n    This yields a short exact sequence:\n    $$ 0 \\to \\text{Coker}(\\times 2) \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Ker}(\\times 0) \\to 0 $$\n    *   The cokernel of multiplication by 2 on $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}) / (2\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The kernel of multiplication by 0 on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    So we have the short exact sequence of abelian groups:\n    $$ 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0 $$\n\n7.  This short exact sequence of $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules splits because $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a projective (free) $\\mathbb{Z}$-module. Therefore, the group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of the other two groups.\n    $$ H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} $$\n\nThe code below performs the calculation of the cokernel which is a part of the argument.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# In our derivation, we found a short exact sequence for H_1(X, Z):\n# 0 -> Coker(f) -> H_1(X, Z) -> Ker(g) -> 0\n# where f is multiplication by 2 on Z/12Z\n# and g is multiplication by 0 on Z.\n\n# Let's compute the cokernel of f.\n# f: Z/12Z -> Z/12Z, f(x) = 2x\n# The image of f is the subgroup generated by 2 in Z/12Z.\nimage_f = { (2 * i) % 12 for i in range(12) }\nimage_order = len(image_f)\n\n# The cokernel is the quotient group (Z/12Z) / Im(f).\n# Its order is |Z/12Z| / |Im(f)|.\ncoker_order = 12 // image_order\n\n# Since the quotient of a cyclic group is cyclic,\n# Coker(f) is isomorphic to Z/coker_order Z.\ncoker_group_str = f\"Z/{coker_order}Z\"\nprint(f\"The group H_1(X_o, Z) is Z/12Z.\")\nprint(f\"The map phi_* induces multiplication by -1 on H_1(X_o, Z).\")\nprint(f\"The map 1-phi_* is multiplication by 1 - (-1) = 2.\")\nprint(f\"The image of multiplication by 2 on Z/12Z is {sorted(list(image_f))}.\")\nprint(f\"The order of the image is {image_order}.\")\nprint(f\"The cokernel group Coker(1-phi_*) is (Z/12Z) / ({image_order}Z/12Z), which is isomorphic to {coker_group_str}.\")\n\n# Now let's compute the kernel of g.\n# g: Z -> Z, g(x) = 0x = 0\n# The kernel of g is the set of all integers x such that 0*x = 0.\n# This is the entire group Z.\nker_g_str = \"Z\"\nprint(f\"The kernel of the map g (multiplication by 0 on Z) is {ker_g_str}.\")\n\n# The short exact sequence is:\n# 0 -> Z/2Z -> H_1(X, Z) -> Z -> 0\n# Since Z is a free module, this sequence splits.\n# Therefore, H_1(X, Z) is the direct sum of Z/2Z and Z.\nfinal_group_str = \"Z + Z/2Z\"\nprint(f\"The splitting of the short exact sequence implies H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to the direct sum of the kernel and cokernel.\")\nprint(f\"So, H_1(X, Z) = {final_group_str}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Z + Z/2Z>>>"
