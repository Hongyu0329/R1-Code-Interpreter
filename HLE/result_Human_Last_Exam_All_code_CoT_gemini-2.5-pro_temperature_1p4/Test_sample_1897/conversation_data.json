    "To find a closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Rewrite the product using q-Pochhammer notation.**\n    Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product is then\n    $$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (q; q^2)_{\\infty} $$\n    This is a known function in the theory of q-series and modular forms.\n\n2.  **Use a known identity from Ramanujan's work.**\n    In his notebooks, Ramanujan studied a function, later denoted $F(q)$ by others, which is precisely our product:\n    $$ F(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}) = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) $$\n    He provided an identity connecting this function to the Jacobi theta function $\\theta_2$:\n    $$ F(q) = \\frac{\\theta_2(0, q^{1/2})}{2q^{1/8}} $$\n\n3.  **Evaluate the expression for our specific value of q.**\n    We need to evaluate this for $q=e^{-\\pi}$. Substituting this into the identity gives:\n    $$ P = F(e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\theta_2(0, e^{-\\pi/2})}{2(e^{-\\pi})^{1/8}} = \\frac{\\theta_2(0, e^{-\\pi/2})}{2e^{-\\pi/8}} $$\n\n4.  **Relate the theta function to the Dedekind eta function.**\n    The Jacobi theta function $\\theta_2(0,q)$ and the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ are related. The standard notation for theta functions uses $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$. For the argument $q=e^{-\\pi/2}$, we have $i\\pi\\tau = -\\pi/2$, which implies $\\tau=i/2$.\n    The identity is:\n    $$ \\theta_2(0, \\tau) = 2\\frac{\\eta(2\\tau)^2}{\\eta(\\tau)} $$\n    For $\\tau=i/2$, we need:\n    $$ \\theta_2(0, i/2) = 2\\frac{\\eta(2 \\cdot i/2)^2}{\\eta(i/2)} = 2\\frac{\\eta(i)^2}{\\eta(i/2)} $$\n\n5.  **Use the modular transformation property of the eta function.**\n    The eta function satisfies $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau}\\eta(\\tau)$. Let $\\tau=i$, we can relate $\\eta(i)$ and $\\eta(i/2)$ via $\\eta(2i)$:\n    Let $\\tau = i/2$, then $-1/\\tau = 2i$. So, $\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{-i(i/2)}\\eta(i/2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    The Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$ has a known special value $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i) = 2^{1/4}$.\n    This gives $\\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)} = 2^{1/4}$, which implies $\\frac{\\eta(i)}{\\eta(2i)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/4}$.\n    Now, substituting this into our expression for $\\theta_2(0, i/2)$:\n    $$ \\theta_2(0, i/2) = 2 \\frac{\\eta(i)^2}{\\eta(i/2)} = 2 \\frac{\\eta(i)^2}{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)} = \\sqrt{2} \\eta(i) \\left(\\frac{\\eta(i)}{\\eta(2i)}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}\\eta(i) \\cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{3/4}\\eta(i) $$\n\n6.  **Substitute back to find the product P.**\n    $$ P = \\frac{2^{3/4}\\eta(i)}{2e^{-\\pi/8}} = 2^{-1/4}e^{\\pi/8}\\eta(i) $$\n\n7.  **Express $\\eta(i)$ using the Gamma function.**\n    The value of the eta function at $\\tau=i$ is a known constant related to the Gamma function:\n    $$ \\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n    Substituting this gives the final closed-form expression:\n    $$ P = 2^{-1/4}e^{\\pi/8} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} = \\frac{e^{\\pi/8} \\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{5/4}\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical value of this expression. It also prints the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The infinite product can be expressed in a closed form using mathematical constants.\n# The closed form is (e^(pi/8) * Gamma(1/4)) / (2^(5/4) * pi^(3/4))\n\n# Calculate the values of the constants\npi = math.pi\ne = math.e\ngamma_1_4 = math.gamma(1/4)\n\n# Calculate the components of the expression\nnumerator = (e**(pi/8)) * gamma_1_4\ndenominator = (2**(5/4)) * (pi**(3/4))\n\n# Calculate the final value\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the formula and the result\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(\"P = (e^(pi/8) * Gamma(1/4)) / (2^(5/4) * pi^(3/4))\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere:\")\nprint(f\"e (Euler's number) = {e}\")\nprint(f\"pi = {pi}\")\nprint(f\"Gamma(1/4) = {gamma_1_4}\")\nprint(\"\\nNumerical value:\")\nprint(result)\n\n# For verification, we can also compute the product directly\n# This requires a library that can handle arbitrary precision, like mpmath\n# from mpmath import mp, qprod, exp, pi\n# mp.dps = 50\n# q = exp(-pi)\n# direct_product = qprod(1, -q, q**2) # This is another way to express the product\n# The form (q; q^2)_oo is equivalent to prod_{n=0 to inf} (1-q^{2n+1})\n# verification_product = 1\n# for n in range(200): # A few terms are enough for high accuracy\n#    verification_product *= (1 - q**(2*n+1))\n# print(\"\\nVerification by direct multiplication:\")\n# print(verification_product)\n\n```\n<<<P = (e^(pi/8) * Gamma(1/4)) / (2^(5/4) * pi^(3/4))>>>"
