# Step 1: Analyze the puzzle structure.
# The puzzle presents two statements. The first, a complex equation, appears to be a red herring
# designed to be overly complex. The real answer lies in the second statement, which forms a simple sequence.
# Statement 2: X8's X9's X10 X11 X12.

# Step 2: Decode the numerical values for the variables in the sequence.

# X8: The clue mentions the Prince of Wales, a title held by Edward who became King Edward VIII.
X8 = 8

# X9: The clue relates to glory. In mythology, glory was granted by the nine Muses.
X9 = 9

# X10: This is the 10th clue provided in the puzzle list. This is a meta-puzzle hint.
X10 = 10

# X11: This is the 11th clue provided in the puzzle list, following the same meta-puzzle logic.
X11 = 11

# Step 3: Identify the pattern and find X12.
# The sequence is 8, 9, 10, 11, ...
# This is a simple arithmetic progression. The next number is 12.
X12 = 12

# Step 4: Print the final output as requested.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation (sequence).
print(f"The solved sequence is based on the values of X8, X9, X10, and X11.")
print(f"X8 = {X8}")
print(f"X9 = {X9}")
print(f"X10 = {X10}")
print(f"X11 = {X11}")
print(f"The sequence is: {X8}, {X9}, {X10}, {X11}, ...")
print(f"The next number in the sequence, X12, is therefore {X12}.")
