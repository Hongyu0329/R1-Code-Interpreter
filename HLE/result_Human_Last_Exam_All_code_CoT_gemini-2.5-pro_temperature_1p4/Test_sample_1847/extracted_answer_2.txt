The analytical solution for the density profile is:

  rho/rho_0  =  3/2 + (1/2) * tanh( (5/24) * x/L )

where:
  rho       is the gas density.
  rho_0     is the ambient (pre-shock) density.
  x         is the position coordinate.
  L         is the ambient conductive length scale L = kappa/(rho_0 * M * c_0 * C_v).
  tanh      is the hyperbolic tangent function.

The individual numbers that form the coefficients in the final equation are:
