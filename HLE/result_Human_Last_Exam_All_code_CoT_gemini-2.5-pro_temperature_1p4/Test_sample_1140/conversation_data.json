    "For the synthesis of a 100 amino acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, standard chemical synthesis is not ideal due to the peptide's length. The most powerful and helpful technique for this task is **Genetic Code Expansion**.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints**: The key challenges are the long peptide chain (100 amino acids) and the inclusion of a non-standard amino acid.\n2.  **Evaluate Standard Methods**: Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) suffers from drastically reduced yield for peptides of this length.\n3.  **Evaluate Advanced Methods**: Two advanced techniques are well-suited for this:\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**: Involves synthesizing smaller peptide fragments chemically (which is efficient) and then stitching them together. This is a very good option.\n    *   **Genetic Code Expansion**: Involves using a modified biological system (like *E. coli*) to produce the peptide. An engineered enzyme-tRNA pair is used to insert the unnatural amino acid at a specific site during protein synthesis.\n4.  **Conclusion**: For a peptide of this size (100 aa), Genetic Code Expansion is often the most efficient and scalable method. It leverages the power of biological protein synthesis to produce high yields of the desired peptide, perfectly incorporating the unnatural amino acid.\n\nThe following Python script outlines this reasoning and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_best_synthesis_technique():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and recommends the best synthesis technique for a long peptide\n    containing an unnatural amino acid (UAA).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Peptide characteristics\n    peptide_length_aa = 100\n    unnatural_amino_acid = \"azido phenylalanine\"\n\n    print(f\"Problem: Synthesize a {peptide_length_aa} amino acid peptide with {unnatural_amino_acid}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Evaluating Options ---\")\n\n    # Option 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n    print(\"1.
