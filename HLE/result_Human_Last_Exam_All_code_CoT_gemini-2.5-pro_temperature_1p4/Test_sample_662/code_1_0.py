# Step 0: Define the given variables
# Basic reproduction number
Ro = 3.0
# Percentage of vaccinated people who still got the infection
infection_rate_in_vaccinated = 0.06

# Step 1: Calculate Vaccine Effectiveness (VE)
# The vaccine is effective if it prevents infection.
# VE is 1 minus the infection rate in the vaccinated population.
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - infection_rate_in_vaccinated

# Step 2: Calculate the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT)
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to stop the epidemic.
# HIT = 1 - (1 / Ro)
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / Ro)

# Step 3: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_c)
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated,
# accounting for vaccine effectiveness.
# p_c = HIT / VE
critical_vaccination_coverage = herd_immunity_threshold / vaccine_effectiveness

# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in
print("To calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_c), we use the formula:")
print("p_c = (1 - (1 / Ro)) / VE")
print("\nPlugging in the numbers:")
# The formatting ensures we show the numbers used in the calculation clearly.
print(f"p_c = (1 - (1 / {Ro})) / {vaccine_effectiveness}")

# Print the final result as a percentage
print(f"\nTherefore, the theoretical threshold of vaccine coverage your state should reach is {critical_vaccination_coverage * 100:.1f}%.")

# The final numerical answer for the system.
final_answer = critical_vaccination_coverage * 100
# <<<70.9>>>
