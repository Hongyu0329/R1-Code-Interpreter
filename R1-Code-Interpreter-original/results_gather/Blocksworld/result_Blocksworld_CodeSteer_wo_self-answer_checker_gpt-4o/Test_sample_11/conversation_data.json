    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top block of each stack.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n3. Follow the goal state order for each stack.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n- Move J from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move F from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n- Move B from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n- Move G from stack4 to stack3.\n- Move D from stack4 to stack1.\n- Move C from stack4 to stack1.\n- Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n- Move I from stack4 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move J from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove C from stack4 to stack1\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove I from stack4 to stack2>>>\n```"
