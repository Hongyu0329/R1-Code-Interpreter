    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at a time. Let's break down the steps needed to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Plan the sequence of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: K I G\n  - stack2: A F B\n  - stack3: J E\n  - stack4: C H D\n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: B E F H\n  - stack2: A D I\n  - stack3: C G J K\n\nNow, let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack2 (to free up H).\n2. Move H from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n3. Move C from stack4 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n7. Move A from stack2 to stack2 (A is already in the correct position).\n8. Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to form the goal stack2).\n9. Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to form the goal stack3).\n10. Move J from stack3 to stack3 (J is already in the correct position).\n11. Move K from stack1 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 4 to 2\nMove H from 4 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 2\nMove I from 1 to 2\nMove G from 1 to 3\nMove J from 3 to 3\nMove K from 1 to 3>>>\n```"
