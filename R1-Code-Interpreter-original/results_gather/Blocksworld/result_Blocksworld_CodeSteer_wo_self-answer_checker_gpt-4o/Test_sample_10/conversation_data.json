    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move blocks from stack2 to stack3 until stack3 has only J.\n2. Move blocks from stack2 to stack1 to form the sequence G I.\n3. Move blocks from stack3 to stack2 to form the sequence A B C D E F H.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n- Move G from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move I from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move J from stack1 to stack3.\n- Move A from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n- Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move F from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n- Move H from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move G from 2 to 1\nMove I from 2 to 1\nMove J from 1 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2>>>\n```"
