    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps needed to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the stacks match the goal state.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to position F under G).\n- Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to position H under A).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to position D under F).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to position C under H).\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to position B alone).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move F from 3 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 3>>>\n```"
