    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's plan the moves step by step:\n\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks for the goal state.\n2. Arrange blocks in the correct order on each stack according to the goal state.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n2. Move J from stack4 to stack2.\n3. Move F from stack4 to stack2.\n4. Move K from stack4 to stack2.\n5. Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n6. Move C from stack3 to stack1.\n7. Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n8. Move E from stack1 to stack2.\n9. Move D from stack1 to stack1.\n10. Move G from stack2 to stack1.\n11. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove F from stack4 to stack2\nMove K from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\n>>>\n```"
