    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n3. Follow the goal state order to place blocks correctly.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n- Move H from stack4 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state for stack2).\n- Move E from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state for stack1).\n- Move D from stack4 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal state for stack1).\n- Move B from stack4 to stack1 (to complete the goal state for stack1).\n- Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to start forming the goal state for stack3).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack3 (C is already in the correct stack, so no move needed).\n- Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to complete the goal state for stack3).\n- Move G from stack3 to stack2 (to complete the goal state for stack2).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack2\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\n>>>\n```"
