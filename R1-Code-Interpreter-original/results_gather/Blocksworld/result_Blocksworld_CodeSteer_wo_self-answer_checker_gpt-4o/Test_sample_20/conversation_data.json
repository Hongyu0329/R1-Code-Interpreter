    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state in stack1).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to clear stack3 for further moves).\n- Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to position G correctly in stack3).\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to position E correctly in stack3).\n- Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to position B correctly in stack1).\n- Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct position, but we need to clear the path for other moves).\n- Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to position C correctly in stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove H from 2 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 3>>>\n```"
