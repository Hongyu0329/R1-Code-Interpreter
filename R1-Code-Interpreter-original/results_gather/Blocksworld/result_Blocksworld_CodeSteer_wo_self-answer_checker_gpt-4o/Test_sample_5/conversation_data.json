    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we must follow the order of the goal state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move A from stack4 to stack3.\n2. Move G from stack4 to stack1.\n3. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n4. Move F from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n5. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n6. Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n7. Move E from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 4 to 3\nMove G from 4 to 1\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove D from 1 to 3>>>\n```"
