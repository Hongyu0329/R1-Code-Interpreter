    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E D\n   - stack2: A B\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A E\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: C D\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack4 (temporary holding).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the series of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 1 to 4\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove D from 4 to 3>>>\n```"
