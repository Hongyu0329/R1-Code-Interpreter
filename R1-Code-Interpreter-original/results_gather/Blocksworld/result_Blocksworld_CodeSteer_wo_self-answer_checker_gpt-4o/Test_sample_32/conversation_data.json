    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: G D B C\n   - stack2: F A E\n   - stack3: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B D E G\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: F\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to achieve the goal state.\n   - Move blocks to their final positions according to the goal state.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to free up B).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to free up D).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to free up G).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to free up stack1 for A).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to free up A).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n\n```plaintext\n<<<Move C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove G from 1 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 3>>>\n```"
