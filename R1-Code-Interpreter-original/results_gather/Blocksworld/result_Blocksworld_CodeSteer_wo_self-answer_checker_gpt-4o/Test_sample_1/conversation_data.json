You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we need to follow the rules of the Blocksworld task.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Move block B from stack2 to stack3.\n2. Move block A from stack2 to stack1.\n3. Move block D from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move block C from stack4 to stack3.\n5. Move block E from stack4 to stack2.\n6. Move block A from stack1 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move B from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove E from 4 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 2>>>\n```"
