    "To solve this problem, we need to move the blocks from their initial positions to the goal state by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. We have three stacks to work with, and we need to move all blocks to stack3 in the order A, B, C, D, E.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move blocks from stack2 to stack3 to free up stack2 for further operations.\n2. Move blocks from stack1 to stack3, ensuring the order is maintained.\n3. Use stack2 as a temporary holding area to rearrange blocks as needed.\n4. Continue moving blocks until stack3 has all blocks in the correct order.\n\nFollowing these steps, here is the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move C from stack2 to stack3\n2. Move D from stack2 to stack1\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack3\n4. Move D from stack1 to stack3\n5. Move B from stack1 to stack2\n6. Move E from stack1 to stack3\n7. Move B from stack2 to stack3\n\nNow, let's format the moves as required:\n\n```\n<<<Move C from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack3>>>\n```"
