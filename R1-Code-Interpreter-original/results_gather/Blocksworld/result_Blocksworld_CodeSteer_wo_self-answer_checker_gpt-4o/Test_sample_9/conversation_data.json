    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move A from stack4 to stack1\n- Move G from stack4 to stack3\n- Move H from stack4 to stack1\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1\n- Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move C from stack4 to stack3\n- Move B from stack2 to stack1\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3\n- Move I from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 4 to 1\nMove G from 4 to 3\nMove H from 4 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3>>>\n```"
