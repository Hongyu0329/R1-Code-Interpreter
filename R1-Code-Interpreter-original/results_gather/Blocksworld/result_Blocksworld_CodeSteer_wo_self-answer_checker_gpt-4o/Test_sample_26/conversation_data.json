    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps needed to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Identify the top block of each stack and determine where it needs to go in the goal state.\n2. Move blocks strategically to free up the necessary blocks and place them in their correct positions.\n3. Continue this process until all blocks are in their correct positions according to the goal state.\n\nLet's outline the moves step by step:\n\n- Move A from stack3 to stack2\n- Move I from stack3 to stack1\n- Move G from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move E from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1\n- Move J from stack1 to stack2\n- Move K from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move F from stack2 to stack1\n- Move H from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move B from stack1 to stack2\n- Move C from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 3 to 2\nMove I from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove J from 1 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\n```"
