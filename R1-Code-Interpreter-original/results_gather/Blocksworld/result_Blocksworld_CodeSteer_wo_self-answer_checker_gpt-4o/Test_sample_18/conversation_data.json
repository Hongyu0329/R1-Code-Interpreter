    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks**: \n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: E\n\n2. **Plan the moves**:\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. The goal is to have stack1 as A D G, stack2 empty, and stack3 as B C E F.\n   - Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Execute the moves**:\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to free up space for A and D on stack1).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to free up A).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to free up space for D).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to free up space for F).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move G from 1 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove E from 2 to 3>>>\n```"
