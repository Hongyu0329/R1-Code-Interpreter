    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we have to use the existing stacks to rearrange the blocks.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n7. Move A from stack4 to stack2.\n8. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n9. Move I from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move E from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove H from 4 to 3\nMove A from 4 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove I from 1 to 3>>>\n```"
