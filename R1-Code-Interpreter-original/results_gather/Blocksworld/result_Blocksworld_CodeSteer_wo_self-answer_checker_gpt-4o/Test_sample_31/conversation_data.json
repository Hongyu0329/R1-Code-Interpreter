    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: B E\n   - stack3: C F D\n   - stack4: A\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B F\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: D E\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move blocks to achieve the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring only the top block of any stack is moved.\n   - Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and are on top of their respective stacks.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack1 (since A needs to be at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (D is already in the correct stack but needs to be at the bottom).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (F needs to be on top of A in stack1).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (C needs to be in stack2).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (E needs to be on top of D in stack3).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (B needs to be on top of F in stack1).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n\n```python\nprint(\"\"\"<<<Move A from 4 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 3\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1>>>\"\"\")\n```",
    "The current solution lacks the necessary complexity to effectively solve the Blocksworld task. The task requires a more strategic approach, potentially involving symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms to determine the optimal sequence of moves. Consider implementing a search algorithm, such as A* or breadth-first search, to explore possible sequences of moves and find the most efficient path to the goal state. This will ensure that the solution is not only correct but also optimal.\n\nTo solve the Blocksworld task optimally, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible sequences of moves. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible states level by level, ensuring that the first solution found is the shortest path to the goal state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to implement BFS for this problem:\n\n1. **Define the State:**\n   - Represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n\n2. **Define the Goal State:**\n   - The goal state is a specific configuration of the stacks.\n\n3. **Generate Possible Moves:**\n   - For each state, generate all possible moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n\n4. **Check for Goal State:**\n   - After each move, check if the new state matches the goal state.\n\n5. **Use BFS to Explore States:**\n   - Use a queue to explore states in a breadth-first manner.\n   - Keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting them.\n\n6. **Output the Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Once the goal state is reached, output the sequence of moves that led to it.\n\nHere's the implementation using BFS:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef blocksworld_bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    # Queue for BFS: stores (current_state, path_to_state)\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if the current state is the goal state\n        if current_state == goal_state:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current state as visited\n        visited.add(current_state)\n        \n        # Generate all possible moves\n        for i, stack in enumerate(current_state):\n            if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n                block = stack[-1]  # Top block\n                for j in range(len(current_state)):\n                    if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                        new_state = list(map(list, current_state))\n                        new_state[i].pop()  # Remove block from current stack\n                        new_state[j].append(block)  # Add block to new stack\n                        new_state_tuple = tuple(map(tuple, new_state))\n                        \n                        if new_state_tuple not in visited:\n                            move = f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"\n                            queue.append((new_state_tuple, path + [move]))\n    \n    return None  # No solution found\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = ((), ('B', 'E'), ('C', 'F', 'D'), ('A',))\ngoal_state = (('A', 'B', 'F'), ('C',), ('D', 'E'), ())\n\n# Find the sequence of moves\nmoves = blocksworld_bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\n# Output the moves\nif moves:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses BFS to find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state from the initial state. Each state is represented as a tuple of tuples, and the algorithm explores all possible moves while avoiding revisiting states. The sequence of moves is printed once the goal state is reached."
