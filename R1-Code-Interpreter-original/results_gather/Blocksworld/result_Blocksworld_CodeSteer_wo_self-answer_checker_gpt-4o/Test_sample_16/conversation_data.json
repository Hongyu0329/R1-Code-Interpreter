    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we have to follow the order of operations carefully to ensure that we don't violate the rules.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n3. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n7. Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move F from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2>>>\n```"
