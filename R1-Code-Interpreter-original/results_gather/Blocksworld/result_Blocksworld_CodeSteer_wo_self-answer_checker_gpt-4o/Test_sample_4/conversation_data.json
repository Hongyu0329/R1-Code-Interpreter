    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at any time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: F A G\n   - stack2: E B\n   - stack3: C D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B D\n   - stack2: G\n   - stack3: C E F\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that only the top block of each stack is moved at any time.\n   - We need to move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to be moved to their goal positions.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack2\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move G from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 2>>>\n```"
