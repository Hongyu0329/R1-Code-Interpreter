    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: E B A\n   - stack4: (empty)\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D E\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: A B\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack4 (temporary holding).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 3 to 4\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove A from 4 to 3>>>\n```"
