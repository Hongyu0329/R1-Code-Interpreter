You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "Let me solve this Blocksworld problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let me create a Python script to help track the state changes and find a valid solution.

It:\n1. Represents each state as a list of stacks\n2. Only allows moving top blocks\n3. Tracks visited states to avoid cycles\n4. Builds the solution path as it goes\n\nLet's analyze the output from the code execution. The solution provides the exact sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state to the goal state, ensuring that:\n- Only top blocks are moved\n- All moves are between existing stacks\n- The final configuration matches the goal state\n\nBased on the code execution output, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<Move F from 1 to 4\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove F from 4 to 3>>>",
