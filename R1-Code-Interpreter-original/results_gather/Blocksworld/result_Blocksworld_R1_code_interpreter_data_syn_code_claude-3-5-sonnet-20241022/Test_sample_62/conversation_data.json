You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Blocksworld Task:\n\nInitial State:\nstack1: B\nstack2: G A F E\nstack3: D C H\n\nGoal State:\nstack1: B\nstack2: C G\nstack3: A D E F H\n\nPlease provide a series of moves to reach the goal state. You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line. Your answer: \n",
