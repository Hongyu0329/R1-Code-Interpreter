    "Let me solve this Blocksworld problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let me create a Python script to represent the problem and find the solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_move(stacks, from_stack, to_stack):\n    # Check if source stack is not empty\n    if not stacks[from_stack]:\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef make_move(stacks, from_stack, to_stack):\n    if is_valid_move(stacks, from_stack, to_stack):\n        block = stacks[from_stack].pop()\n        stacks[to_stack].append(block)\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef get_state_string(stacks):\n    return str(stacks)\n\ndef find_solution():\n    # Initialize stacks\n    stacks = [\n        ['D'],        # stack1\n        ['C'],        # stack2\n        ['E', 'B', 'A'],  # stack3\n        []           # stack4\n    ]\n    \n    goal_stacks = [\n        ['D', 'E'],   # stack1\n        ['C'],        # stack2\n        ['A', 'B'],   # stack3\n        []           # stack4\n    ]\n    \n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move A from stack3 to stack4 (temporary)\n    make_move(stacks, 2, 3)\n    moves.append(f\"Move A from 3 to 4\")\n    \n    # Move B from stack3 to stack4\n    make_move(stacks, 2, 3)\n    moves.append(f\"Move B from 3 to 4\")\n    \n    # Move E from stack3 to stack1\n    make_move(stacks, 2, 0)\n    moves.append(f\"Move E from 3 to 1\")\n    \n    # Move B from stack4 to stack3\n    make_move(stacks, 3, 2)\n    moves.append(f\"Move B from 4 to 3\")\n    \n    # Move A from stack4 to stack3\n    make_move(stacks, 3, 2)\n    moves.append(f\"Move A from 4 to 3\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n\nfind_solution()\n```\n\nLet me explain the solution:\n1. First, we need to move A from stack3 to stack4 (temporary)\n2. Then move B from stack3 to stack4\n3. Now we can move E from stack3 to stack1\n4. Move B from stack4 to stack3\n5. Finally, move A from stack4 to stack3\n\nThis sequence of moves will achieve the goal state:\n- stack1 will have D E\n- stack2 will have C\n- stack3 will have A B\n- stack4 will be empty\n\nBased on the code execution, here's the final answer:\n\n<<<Move A from 3 to 4\nMove B from 3 to 4\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove B from 4 to 3\nMove A from 4 to 3>>>",
    "Let me verify if this solution is correct by checking each step:\n\nInitial State:\nstack1: D\nstack2: C\nstack3: E B A\nstack4: \n\nAfter \"Move A from 3 to 4\":\nstack1: D\nstack2: C\nstack3: E B\nstack4: A\n\nAfter \"Move B from 3 to 4\":\nstack1: D\nstack2: C\nstack3: E\nstack4: B A\n\nAfter \"Move E from 3 to 1\":\nstack1: D E\nstack2: C\nstack3: \nstack4: B A\n\nAfter \"Move B from 4 to 3\":\nstack1: D E\nstack2: C\nstack3: B\nstack4: A\n\nAfter \"Move A from 4 to 3\":\nstack1: D E\nstack2: C\nstack3: A B\nstack4: \n\nFinal State:\nstack1: D E\nstack2: C\nstack3: A B\nstack4: \n\nComparing with the goal state:\nGoal State:\nstack1: D E\nstack2: C\nstack3: A B\nstack4: \n\nThe solution is correct! The sequence of moves transforms the initial state to the goal state while following all the rules:\n1. Only moved one block at a time\n2. Only moved the top block of each stack\n3. Used only existing stacks\n4. Reached the exact goal state configuration\n\nTherefore, I confirm the answer is correct:\n\n<<<Move A from 3 to 4\nMove B from 3 to 4\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove B from 4 to 3\nMove A from 4 to 3>>>"
