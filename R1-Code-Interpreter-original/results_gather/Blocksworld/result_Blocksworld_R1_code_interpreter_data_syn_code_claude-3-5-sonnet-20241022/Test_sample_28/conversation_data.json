You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

The code implements a depth-first search algorithm to find a valid sequence of moves\n2. It maintains the constraint that only the top block can be moved\n3. It checks for the goal state and avoids cycles by keeping track of visited states\n4. The solution provides the moves in the required format\n\nBased on the code execution, here is the solution:\n\n<<<Move C from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove A from 3 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 2>>>",
