You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

First clears stack 4 by moving blocks to appropriate positions\n2. Then moves blocks from stack 1 to their goal positions\n3. Finally adjusts the remaining blocks to reach the goal state\n4. Each move only moves the top block of a stack\n5. All moves are valid and reach the goal state\n6. Uses only existing stacks (1-4)",
    "I notice that the code output has some issues.

Clears stack 4 by moving C and F to stack 2 (where they belong), and K and D to stack 3 (where they belong)\n2. Moves A and E from stack 1 to stack 3 (their goal position)\n3. Moves B and I from stack 1 to stack 2 (their goal position)\n4. Moves G from stack 3 to stack 2 (its goal position)\n5. Finally moves J from stack 2 to stack 3 (its goal position)\n6.
