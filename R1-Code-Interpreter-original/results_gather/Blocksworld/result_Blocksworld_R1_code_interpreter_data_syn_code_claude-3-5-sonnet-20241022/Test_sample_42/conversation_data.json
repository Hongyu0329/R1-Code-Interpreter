You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

First, we move E out of the way to stack2\n2. Then move D to its goal position in stack1\n3. Move E to its goal position in stack2\n4. Move C temporarily to stack1\n5. Move B to its goal position in stack2\n6. Move C to its goal position in stack3\n7. Finally, move A to its goal position in stack3\n\nThe code simulates these moves while checking their validity and generates the output in the required format.
