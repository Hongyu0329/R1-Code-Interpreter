You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "Let me solve this Blocksworld problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let me create a Python program to help track the state and find valid moves:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_move(stacks, from_stack, to_stack):\n    # Check if source stack is not empty\n    if not stacks[from_stack-1]:\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef print_moves(moves):\n    result = \"\"\n    for move in moves:\n        result += f\"Move {move[0]} from {move[1]} to {move[2]}\\n\"\n    return result.strip()\n\ndef get_top_block(stack):\n    return stack[-1] if stack else None\n\ndef solve_blocksworld():\n    # Initial state\n    stacks = [\n        [],                  # stack1\n        ['E'],              # stack2\n        ['B', 'A', 'F', 'J'],  # stack3\n        ['C', 'G', 'D', 'H', 'I']   # stack4\n    ]\n    \n    # Goal state\n    goal = [\n        ['C', 'D'],         # stack1\n        ['E', 'F', 'I'],    # stack2\n        ['A', 'B', 'G', 'H', 'J']  # stack3\n    ]\n    \n    moves = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Move I from stack4\n    moves.append(('I', 4, 2))\n    stacks[3].pop()\n    \n    # Step 2: Move H from stack4\n    moves.append(('H', 4, 3))\n    stacks[3].pop()\n    \n    # Step 3: Move D from stack4\n    moves.append(('D', 4, 1))\n    stacks[3].pop()\n    \n    # Step 4: Move G from stack4\n    moves.append(('G', 4, 3))\n    stacks[3].pop()\n    \n    # Step 5: Move C from stack4\n    moves.append(('C', 4, 1))\n    stacks[3].pop()\n    \n    # Step 6: Move J from stack3\n    moves.append(('J', 3, 3))\n    stacks[2].pop()\n    \n    # Step 7: Move F from stack3\n    moves.append(('F', 3, 2))\n    stacks[2].pop()\n    \n    print(print_moves(moves))\n\nsolve_blocksworld()\n```\n\nLet me explain the solution:\n1. First, we move I from stack4 to stack2 (goal position)\n2. Then H from stack4 to stack3 (goal position)\n3. Move D from stack4 to stack1 (goal position)\n4. Move G from stack4 to stack3 (goal position)\n5. Move C from stack4 to stack1 (goal position)\n6. Move J from stack3 to stack3 (already in correct stack)\n7. Move F from stack3 to stack2 (goal position)\n\nThe blocks are now in their goal positions. Let me format the answer:\n\n<<<Move I from 4 to 2\nMove H from 4 to 3\nMove D from 4 to 1\nMove G from 4 to 3\nMove C from 4 to 1\nMove J from 3 to 3\nMove F from 3 to 2>>>",
    "Let me verify if this solution is correct by checking each move and the resulting state:\n\nInitial State:\nstack1: \nstack2: E\nstack3: B A F J\nstack4: C G D H I\n\nAfter moves:\n1. Move I from 4 to 2\n   stack1: \n   stack2: E I\n   stack3: B A F J\n   stack4: C G D H\n\n2. Move H from 4 to 3\n   stack1: \n   stack2: E I\n   stack3: B A F J H\n   stack4: C G D\n\n3. Move D from 4 to 1\n   stack1: D\n   stack2: E I\n   stack3: B A F J H\n   stack4: C G\n\n4. Move G from 4 to 3\n   stack1: D\n   stack2: E I\n   stack3: B A F J H G\n   stack4: C\n\n5. Move C from 4 to 1\n   stack1: C D\n   stack2: E I\n   stack3: B A F J H G\n   stack4: \n\n6. Move J from 3 to 3 (This move is unnecessary as J is already in stack3)\n\n7. Move F from 3 to 2\n   stack1: C D\n   stack2: E F I\n   stack3: B A J H G\n\nChecking against goal state:\nGoal State:\nstack1: C D ✓\nstack2: E F I ✓\nstack3: A B G H J ✗\n\nI notice that the final state doesn't match the goal state exactly. We need to rearrange stack3 to get A B G H J. Let me write a new solution:\n\n```python\ndef print_moves(moves):\n    result = \"\"\n    for move in moves:\n        result += f\"Move {move[0]} from {move[1]} to {move[2]}\\n\"\n    return result.strip()\n\ndef solve_blocksworld():\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Clear space and get C D in stack1\n    moves.append(('I', 4, 2))  # Move I to its final position in stack2\n    moves.append(('H', 4, 1))  # Temporarily move H to stack1\n    moves.append(('D', 4, 2))  # Temporarily move D to stack2\n    moves.append(('G', 4, 1))  # Temporarily move G to stack1\n    moves.append(('C', 4, 1))  # Move C to its final position in stack1\n    moves.append(('G', 1, 3))  # Move G to stack3\n    moves.append(('H', 1, 3))  # Move H to stack3\n    moves.append(('D', 2, 1))  # Move D to its final position in stack1\n    \n    # Arrange stack2\n    moves.append(('J', 3, 1))  # Temporarily move J\n    moves.append(('F', 3, 2))  # Move F to its final position in stack2\n    \n    # Arrange stack3\n    moves.append(('A', 3, 4))  # Temporarily move A\n    moves.append(('B', 3, 1))  # Temporarily move B\n    moves.append(('G', 3, 4))  # Temporarily move G\n    moves.append(('H', 3, 4))  # Temporarily move H\n    moves.append(('A', 4, 3))  # Move A to its final position\n    moves.append(('B', 1, 3))  # Move B to its final position\n    moves.append(('G', 4, 3))  # Move G to its final position\n    moves.append(('H', 4, 3))  # Move H to its final position\n    moves.append(('J', 1, 3))  # Move J to its final position\n    \n    print(print_moves(moves))\n\nsolve_blocksworld()\n```\n\nThis new solution should properly arrange all blocks to their goal positions. Let's see the output.",
