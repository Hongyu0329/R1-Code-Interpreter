    "Let me solve this Blocksworld problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let me create a Python script to help track the state changes and find a valid solution.

It maintains the following rules:\n1. Only the top block can be moved\n2. Moves are only allowed between existing stacks\n3. Each state is tracked to avoid cycles\n\nLet me analyze the output and verify it matches our requirements:\n\n<<<Move H from 1 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 2>>>",
