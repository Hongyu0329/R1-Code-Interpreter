    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: E G H D A C\n- stack3: \n- stack4: B F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C F G H\n- stack2: \n- stack3: B D E\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. Move blocks from stack2 to stack3 and stack4 to free up the blocks needed for stack1.\n2. Move blocks to stack1 in the correct order.\n3. Move remaining blocks to stack3 to achieve the goal state.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate the moves:\n\n```python\n# Initial stacks\nstack1 = []\nstack2 = ['E', 'G', 'H', 'D', 'A', 'C']\nstack3 = []\nstack4 = ['B', 'F']\n\n# Moves list\nmoves = []\n\n# Function to move a block\ndef move_block(source, destination, source_stack, destination_stack):\n    block = source_stack.pop()\n    destination_stack.append(block)\n    moves.append(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Move C from stack2 to stack1\nmove_block(2, 1, stack2, stack1)\n\n# Move A from stack2 to stack1\nmove_block(2, 1, stack2, stack1)\n\n# Move D from stack2 to stack3\nmove_block(2, 3, stack2, stack3)\n\n# Move H from stack2 to stack1\nmove_block(2, 1, stack2, stack1)\n\n# Move G from stack2 to stack1\nmove_block(2, 1, stack2, stack1)\n\n# Move F from stack4 to stack1\nmove_block(4, 1, stack4, stack1)\n\n# Move B from stack4 to stack3\nmove_block(4, 3, stack4, stack3)\n\n# Move E from stack2 to stack3\nmove_block(2, 3, stack2, stack3)\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis script will generate the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove H from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove F from 4 to 1\nMove B from 4 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\n>>>"
