    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F I H\n- stack2: G A E C B\n- stack3: D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: E F G\n- stack3: B D H I\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Identify the top blocks**: \n   - stack1: H\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Determine the moves needed to achieve the goal state**:\n   - Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks for the goal state.\n   - Ensure that the blocks are moved in a way that allows the final configuration to be achieved.\n\n3. **Execute the moves**:\n   - Move blocks from the initial state to match the goal state.\n\nLet's write a series of moves to achieve the goal state:\n\n```python\n# Initial State\nstack1 = ['F', 'I', 'H']\nstack2 = ['G', 'A', 'E', 'C', 'B']\nstack3 = ['D']\n\n# Goal State\ngoal_stack1 = ['A', 'C']\ngoal_stack2 = ['E', 'F', 'G']\ngoal_stack3 = ['B', 'D', 'H', 'I']\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move B from stack2 to stack3\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 2 to 3\")\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\n\n# Move C from stack2 to stack1\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 2 to 1\")\nstack1.append(stack2.pop())\n\n# Move E from stack2 to stack1\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 2 to 1\")\nstack1.append(stack2.pop())\n\n# Move A from stack2 to stack1\nmoves.append(\"Move A from 2 to 1\")\nstack1.append(stack2.pop())\n\n# Move G from stack2 to stack3\nmoves.append(\"Move G from 2 to 3\")\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\n\n# Move F from stack1 to stack2\nmoves.append(\"Move F from 1 to 2\")\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\n\n# Move I from stack1 to stack3\nmoves.append(\"Move I from 1 to 3\")\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\n\n# Move H from stack1 to stack3\nmoves.append(\"Move H from 1 to 3\")\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\n\n# Move D from stack3 to stack2\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 3 to 2\")\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\n\n# Move E from stack1 to stack2\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 1 to 2\")\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\n\n# Move A from stack1 to stack2\nmoves.append(\"Move A from 1 to 2\")\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the series of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the series of moves were generated to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove I from 1 to 3\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 2\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
