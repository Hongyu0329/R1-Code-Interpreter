    "To solve this problem, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: H D\n   - stack2: E J A C F\n   - stack3: B I G K\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B E I J K\n   - stack2: A C D F\n   - stack3: G H\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to move blocks from their current positions to match the goal state.\n   - We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We need to carefully plan the moves to avoid unnecessary steps.\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks and rearrange them according to the goal state.\n   - Use stack3 as a temporary holding area when needed.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to simulate the moves and find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['H', 'D'],\n    'stack2': ['E', 'J', 'A', 'C', 'F'],\n    'stack3': ['B', 'I', 'G', 'K']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['B', 'E', 'I', 'J', 'K'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'C', 'D', 'F'],\n    'stack3': ['G', 'H']\n}\n\n# Function to print the move\ndef move(block, source, destination):\n    print(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Function to perform the moves\ndef solve_blocks(initial, goal):\n    # Move K from stack3 to stack1\n    move('K', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n    initial['stack3'].pop()\n    initial['stack1'].append('K')\n    \n    # Move G from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n    \n    # Move I from stack3 to stack1\n    move('I', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n    initial['stack3'].pop()\n    initial['stack1'].append('I')\n    \n    # Move B from stack3 to stack1\n    move('B', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n    initial['stack3'].pop()\n    initial['stack1'].append('B')\n    \n    # Move F from stack2 to stack3\n    move('F', 'stack2', 'stack3')\n    initial['stack2'].pop()\n    initial['stack3'].append('F')\n    \n    # Move C from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n    \n    # Move A from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n    \n    # Move J from stack2 to stack1\n    move('J', 'stack2', 'stack1')\n    initial['stack2'].pop()\n    initial['stack1'].append('J')\n    \n    # Move E from stack2 to stack1\n    move('E', 'stack2', 'stack1')\n    initial['stack2'].pop()\n    initial['stack1'].append('E')\n    \n    # Move D from stack1 to stack2\n    move('D', 'stack1', 'stack2')\n    initial['stack1'].pop()\n    initial['stack2'].append('D')\n    \n    # Move H from stack1 to stack3\n    move('H', 'stack1', 'stack3')\n    initial['stack1'].pop()\n    initial['stack3'].append('H')\n\n# Execute the solution\nsolve_blocks(initial_state, goal_state)\n```\n\nThis script will print the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's execute it to see the result.",
