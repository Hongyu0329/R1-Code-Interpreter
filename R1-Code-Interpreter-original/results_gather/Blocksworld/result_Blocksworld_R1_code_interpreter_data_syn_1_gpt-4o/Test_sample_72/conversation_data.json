    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: D A E C\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: A B D\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This is necessary because C needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n2. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: E should be on top of C in stack2.\n3. **Move A from stack3 to stack1**: A needs to be moved to stack3 eventually, but we need to clear the way for B and D first.\n4. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: B needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n5. **Move D from stack3 to stack3**: D is already in the correct position, but we need to move A back to stack3.\n6. **Move A from stack1 to stack3**: Finally, move A back to stack3 to complete the goal state.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the moves are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstack1 = ['F']\nstack2 = ['B']\nstack3 = ['D', 'A', 'E', 'C']\n\n# Moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move C from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move E from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move A from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move A from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move B from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no actual move needed, just for clarity)\n# stack3.append(stack3.pop()) # D is already in place, no move needed\n\n# Move A from stack1 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move A from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output provides the series of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's format the final answer according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 3\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
