    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F A G\n- stack2: E B\n- stack3: C D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B D\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: C E F\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move G from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n3. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n6. Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n7. Move E from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n8. Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\nLet's implement this plan in a series of moves:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['F', 'A', 'G'],\n    'stack2': ['E', 'B'],\n    'stack3': ['C', 'D']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['A', 'B', 'D'],\n    'stack2': ['G'],\n    'stack3': ['C', 'E', 'F']\n}\n\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move G from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move F from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move E from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move B from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move D from stack3 to stack1\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output provides the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state. The moves are as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
