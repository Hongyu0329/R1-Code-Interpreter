    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: A J\n- stack3: H F C E I\n- stack4: B G\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: F I\n- stack2: A B C D G\n- stack3: E H J\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to free up stack1 for F and I).\n- Move J from stack2 to stack3 (to free up stack2 for A, B, C, D, G).\n- Move I from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state in stack1).\n- Move E from stack3 to stack3 (to free up F for moving).\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1 in the goal state).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state in stack2).\n- Move H from stack3 to stack3 (to free up J for moving).\n- Move J from stack3 to stack3 (to complete stack3 in the goal state).\n- Move G from stack4 to stack2 (to complete stack2 in the goal state).\n- Move B from stack4 to stack2 (to complete stack2 in the goal state).\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the sequence of moves is correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['D'],\n    2: ['A', 'J'],\n    3: ['H', 'F', 'C', 'E', 'I'],\n    4: ['B', 'G']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    (1, 2),  # Move D from stack1 to stack2\n    (2, 3),  # Move J from stack2 to stack3\n    (3, 1),  # Move I from stack3 to stack1\n    (3, 3),  # Move E from stack3 to stack3\n    (3, 1),  # Move F from stack3 to stack1\n    (3, 2),  # Move C from stack3 to stack2\n    (3, 3),  # Move H from stack3 to stack3\n    (3, 3),  # Move J from stack3 to stack3\n    (4, 2),  # Move G from stack4 to stack2\n    (4, 2)   # Move B from stack4 to stack2\n]\n\n# Execute the moves\nmove_instructions = []\nfor source, destination in moves:\n    block = stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n    move_instructions.append(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Print the move instructions\nprint(\"\\n\".join(move_instructions))\n```\n\nThe code will execute the planned moves and print the sequence of instructions needed to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's see the output.",
