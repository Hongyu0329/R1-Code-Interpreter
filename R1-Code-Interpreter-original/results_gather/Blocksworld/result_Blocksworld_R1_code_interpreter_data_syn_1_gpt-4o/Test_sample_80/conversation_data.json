    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: E C J\n- stack2: H D\n- stack3: G I A B F\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C D E F G\n- stack2: B H J\n- stack3: I\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state of the stacks after each move.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1\n- Move B from stack3 to stack2\n- Move A from stack3 to stack1\n- Move I from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move G from stack3 to stack1\n- Move D from stack2 to stack1\n- Move H from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move J from stack1 to stack2\n- Move C from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate these moves and ensure they are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstack1 = ['E', 'C', 'J']\nstack2 = ['H', 'D']\nstack3 = ['G', 'I', 'A', 'B', 'F']\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    ('F', 3, 1),\n    ('B', 3, 2),\n    ('A', 3, 1),\n    ('G', 3, 1),\n    ('D', 2, 1),\n    ('J', 1, 2)\n]\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move_block(source, destination):\n    block = source.pop()\n    destination.append(block)\n\n# Perform the moves\nfor block, src, dest in moves:\n    if src == 1:\n        source = stack1\n    elif src == 2:\n        source = stack2\n    else:\n        source = stack3\n\n    if dest == 1:\n        destination = stack1\n    elif dest == 2:\n        destination = stack2\n    else:\n        destination = stack3\n\n    move_block(source, destination)\n\n# Print the final stacks\nprint(\"stack1:\", stack1)\nprint(\"stack2:\", stack2)\nprint(\"stack3:\", stack3)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the final state of the stacks.",
