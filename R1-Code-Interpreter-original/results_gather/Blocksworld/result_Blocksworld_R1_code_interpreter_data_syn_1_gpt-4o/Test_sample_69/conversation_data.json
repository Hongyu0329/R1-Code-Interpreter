    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the task and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: H I B E A\n- stack2: J\n- stack3: G\n- stack4: F D K C\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: H\n- stack2: B C F G I\n- stack3: A D E J K\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move A to stack3**: This will free up E, which needs to be moved to stack3 eventually.\n2. **Move E to stack3**: This will free up B, which needs to be moved to stack2.\n3. **Move B to stack2**: This is the correct position for B in the goal state.\n4. **Move I to stack2**: This is the correct position for I in the goal state.\n5. **Move H to stack1**: H is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n6. **Move C to stack2**: This is the correct position for C in the goal state.\n7. **Move K to stack3**: This is the correct position for K in the goal state.\n8. **Move D to stack3**: This is the correct position for D in the goal state.\n9. **Move F to stack2**: This is the correct position for F in the goal state.\n10. **Move G to stack2**: This is the correct position for G in the goal state.\n11. **Move J to stack3**: This is the correct position for J in the goal state.\n\nLet's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the moves to transform the initial state to the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move A from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move E from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move B from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move I from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move C from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move K from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move D from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move F from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move G from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move J from stack2 to stack3\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
