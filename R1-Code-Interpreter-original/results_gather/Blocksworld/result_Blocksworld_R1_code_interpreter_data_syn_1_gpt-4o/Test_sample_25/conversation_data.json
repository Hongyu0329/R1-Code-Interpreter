    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: A G\n- stack2: F E\n- stack3: C\n- stack4: H J I B D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B\n- stack2: C E G J\n- stack3: D F H I\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack3.\n2. Move B from stack4 to stack1.\n3. Move I from stack4 to stack3.\n4. Move J from stack4 to stack2.\n5. Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n6. Move G from stack1 to stack2.\n7. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the moves are valid and achieve the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['A', 'G'],\n    2: ['F', 'E'],\n    3: ['C'],\n    4: ['H', 'J', 'I', 'B', 'D']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    ('D', 4, 3),\n    ('B', 4, 1),\n    ('I', 4, 3),\n    ('J', 4, 2),\n    ('H', 4, 3),\n    ('G', 1, 2),\n    ('F', 2, 3),\n    ('C', 3, 2)\n]\n\n# Execute the moves\nfor block, source, destination in moves:\n    if stacks[source][-1] == block:\n        stacks[source].pop()\n        stacks[destination].append(block)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid move: {block} is not on top of stack {source}\")\n\n# Print the moves\nfor block, source, destination in moves:\n    print(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n```\n\nThis code will execute the planned moves and print them in the required format. Let's see the output.",
    "The error indicates that the move for block G is invalid because G is not on top of stack 1 at the time of the move. Let's re-evaluate the sequence of moves to ensure that each move is valid according to the current state of the stacks.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack3.\n2. Move B from stack4 to stack1.\n3. Move I from stack4 to stack3.\n4. Move J from stack4 to stack2.\n5. Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n6. Move G from stack1 to stack2.\n7.
