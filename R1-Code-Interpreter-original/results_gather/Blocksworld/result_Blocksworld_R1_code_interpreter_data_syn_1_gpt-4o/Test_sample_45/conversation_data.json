    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E D C\n   - stack2: F B\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: C D\n   - stack3: A B F\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We will move blocks one at a time, ensuring that we only move the top block from any stack.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3\n\nLet's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    \"stack1\": [\"E\", \"D\", \"C\"],\n    \"stack2\": [\"F\", \"B\"],\n    \"stack3\": [\"A\"],\n    \"stack4\": []\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    \"stack1\": [\"E\"],\n    \"stack2\": [\"C\", \"D\"],\n    \"stack3\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"F\"]\n}\n\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move C from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move D from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move B from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move F from stack2 to stack3\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
