    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: B A C\n   - stack3: E D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B E\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: A D\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration. Let's analyze the moves:\n\n1. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: This will free up A to be moved.\n2. **Move A from stack2 to stack3**: This will allow us to move B to its goal position.\n3. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: Now B is in its goal position.\n4. **Move D from stack3 to stack2**: This will allow us to move E to its goal position.\n5. **Move E from stack3 to stack1**: Now E is in its goal position.\n6. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: This is a redundant move, but it helps to visualize the final state.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move C from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move A from 2 to 3\",\n    \"Move B from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move D from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move E from 3 to 1\",\n    \"Move A from 3 to 3\"\n]\n\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. However, the last move \"Move A from 3 to 3\" is redundant and unnecessary. Let's refine the solution to remove this redundancy and provide the final answer in the required format.\n\nHere's the refined series of moves:\n\n1. Move C from stack2 to stack1\n2. Move A from stack2 to stack3\n3. Move B from stack2 to stack1\n4. Move D from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n\nNow, let's present the final answer:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 1\n>>>"
