    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the initial and goal states:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: F A B\n- stack3: E\n- stack4: C\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: B C D E\n- stack3: A F\n\nTo achieve the goal state, we need to perform a series of moves. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to free up stack1).\n2. Move C from stack4 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n3. Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal stack2).\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack2 (B is already in stack2, so no move is needed).\n5. Move A from stack2 to stack3 (to form the goal stack3).\n6. Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    \"stack1\": [\"D\"],\n    \"stack2\": [\"F\", \"A\", \"B\"],\n    \"stack3\": [\"E\"],\n    \"stack4\": [\"C\"]\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    \"stack1\": [],\n    \"stack2\": [\"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"],\n    \"stack3\": [\"A\", \"F\"]\n}\n\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move D from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move C from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move E from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move A from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move F from stack2 to stack3\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the moves were printed as expected. Now, let's format the final answer according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack4 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
