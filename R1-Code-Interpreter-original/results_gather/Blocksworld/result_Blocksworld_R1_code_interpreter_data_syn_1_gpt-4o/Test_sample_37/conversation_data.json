    "To solve this problem, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. We will carefully plan each move to achieve the desired configuration.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: A E F\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: D H G\n   - stack4: I\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B C D E\n   - stack2: A F G H\n   - stack3: I\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration.\n   - We will move blocks from the top of one stack to another, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the moves:\n\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration.\n- We will move blocks from the top of one stack to another, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. Move F from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack2.\n3. Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n4. Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n5. Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n6. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n7. Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n8. Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n9. Move A from stack3 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move F from 1 to 2\",\n    \"Move E from 1 to 2\",\n    \"Move A from 1 to 3\",\n    \"Move G from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move H from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move D from 3 to 1\",\n    \"Move C from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move B from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move A from 3 to 2\"\n]\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the series of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state is provided.
