    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: F A\n   - stack2: K D E B I C\n   - stack3: H J G\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: B D\n   - stack3: A C E F H I J K\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. The goal is to have:\n  - stack1: G\n  - stack2: B D\n  - stack3: A C E F H I J K\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Move blocks from stack2 to stack3 to free up B and D.\n2. Move B and D to stack2.\n3. Move remaining blocks to stack3 to achieve the goal configuration.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate the moves:\n\n```python\n# Initial configuration\nstack1 = ['F', 'A']\nstack2 = ['K', 'D', 'E', 'B', 'I', 'C']\nstack3 = ['H', 'J', 'G']\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move C from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move I from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move I from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move B from stack2 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 2 to 2\")\n\n# Move E from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move D from stack2 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 2 to 2\")\n\n# Move K from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move K from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move A from stack1 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move A from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Move F from stack1 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move F from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Move G from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move G from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis script will simulate the moves needed to achieve the goal state.
