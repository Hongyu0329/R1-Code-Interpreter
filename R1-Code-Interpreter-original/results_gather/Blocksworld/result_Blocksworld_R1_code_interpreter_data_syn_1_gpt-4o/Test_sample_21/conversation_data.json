    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: F\n- stack3: G C\n- stack4: A B D E H\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B D E\n- stack2: G H\n- stack3: A C F\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move H from stack4 to stack2 to start forming the goal state for stack2.\n2. Move E from stack4 to stack1 to start forming the goal state for stack1.\n3. Move D from stack4 to stack1 to continue forming the goal state for stack1.\n4. Move B from stack4 to stack1 to complete the goal state for stack1.\n5. Move A from stack4 to stack3 to start forming the goal state for stack3.\n6. Move C from stack3 to stack3 to continue forming the goal state for stack3.\n7. Move G from stack3 to stack2 to complete the goal state for stack2.\n8. Move F from stack2 to stack3 to complete the goal state for stack3.\n\nLet's execute these steps in the correct order:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    \"stack1\": [],\n    \"stack2\": [\"F\"],\n    \"stack3\": [\"G\", \"C\"],\n    \"stack4\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"D\", \"E\", \"H\"]\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    \"stack1\": [\"B\", \"D\", \"E\"],\n    \"stack2\": [\"G\", \"H\"],\n    \"stack3\": [\"A\", \"C\", \"F\"]\n}\n\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move H from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move E from stack4 to stack1\",\n    \"Move D from stack4 to stack1\",\n    \"Move B from stack4 to stack1\",\n    \"Move A from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move C from stack3 to stack3\",\n    \"Move G from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move F from stack2 to stack3\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state is provided. Let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack2\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
