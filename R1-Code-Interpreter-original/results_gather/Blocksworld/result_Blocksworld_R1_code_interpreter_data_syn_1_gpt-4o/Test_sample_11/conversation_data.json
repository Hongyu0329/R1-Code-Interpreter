    "To solve this problem, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: E\n- stack3: B A F J\n- stack4: C G D H I\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: C D\n- stack2: E F I\n- stack3: A B G H J\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to be moved to their goal positions.\n2. Ensure that each move is valid by only moving the top block of any stack.\n3. Follow a sequence of moves that gradually transforms the initial state into the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move I from stack4 to stack2\n- Move H from stack4 to stack3\n- Move D from stack4 to stack1\n- Move G from stack4 to stack3\n- Move C from stack4 to stack1\n- Move J from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move F from stack3 to stack2\n- Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move B from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nLet's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence of moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move I from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move H from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move D from stack4 to stack1\",\n    \"Move G from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move C from stack4 to stack1\",\n    \"Move F from stack3 to stack2\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves was generated correctly. Now, let's format the final answer according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack4 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove C from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
