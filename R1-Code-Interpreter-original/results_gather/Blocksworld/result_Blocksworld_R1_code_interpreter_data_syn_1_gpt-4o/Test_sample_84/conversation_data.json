    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's break down the problem and determine the sequence of moves required.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: E C\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: A B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: A C E\n- stack3: D\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This will free up A to be moved next.\n2. **Move A from stack3 to stack2**: This places A in its final position.\n3. **Move D from stack2 to stack3**: This clears stack2 for the next moves.\n4. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This places C in its final position.\n5. **Move E from stack1 to stack2**: This places E in its final position.\n6. **Move B from stack1 to stack1**: This is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move B from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move A from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move D from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move C from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move E from stack1 to stack2\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the sequence of moves needed to reach the goal state. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves was printed correctly. Now, let's format the final answer according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Blocksworld Task:\n\nInitial State:\nstack1: E C\nstack2: D\nstack3: A B\n\nGoal State:\nstack1: B\nstack2: A C E\nstack3: D\n\nPlease provide a series of moves to reach the goal state.
