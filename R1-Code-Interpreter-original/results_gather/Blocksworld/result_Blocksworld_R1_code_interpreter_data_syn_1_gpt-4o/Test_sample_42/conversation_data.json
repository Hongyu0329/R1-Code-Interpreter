    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: A\n- stack2: \n- stack3: B C D E\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: B E\n- stack3: A C\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n2. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, but for clarity, it stays).\n4. Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n5. Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the sequence of moves is correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['A'],\n    'stack2': [],\n    'stack3': ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['D'],\n    'stack2': ['B', 'E'],\n    'stack3': ['A', 'C']\n}\n\n# Function to perform the moves\ndef perform_moves(initial, goal):\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move E from stack3 to stack2\n    initial['stack2'].append(initial['stack3'].pop())\n    moves.append(\"Move E from 3 to 2\")\n    \n    # Move D from stack3 to stack1\n    initial['stack1'].append(initial['stack3'].pop())\n    moves.append(\"Move D from 3 to 1\")\n    \n    # Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, but for clarity, it stays)\n    # No move needed for C as it stays in stack3\n    \n    # Move B from stack3 to stack2\n    initial['stack2'].append(initial['stack3'].pop())\n    moves.append(\"Move B from 3 to 2\")\n    \n    # Move A from stack1 to stack3\n    initial['stack3'].append(initial['stack1'].pop())\n    moves.append(\"Move A from 1 to 3\")\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves\nmoves_sequence = perform_moves(initial_state, goal_state)\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves_sequence:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's format the final answer according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 3\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
