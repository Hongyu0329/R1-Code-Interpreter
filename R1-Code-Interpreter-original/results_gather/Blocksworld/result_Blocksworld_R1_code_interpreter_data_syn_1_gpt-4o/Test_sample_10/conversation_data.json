    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We have three stacks, and we can only move the top block from one stack to another. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: J\n- stack2: D H F I B A G\n- stack3: E C\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: G I\n- stack2: A B C D E F H\n- stack3: J\n\nWe need to move blocks to achieve the goal state.

Move blocks from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the goal state.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate these moves:\n\n```python\n# Initial stacks\nstack1 = ['J']\nstack2 = ['D', 'H', 'F', 'I', 'B', 'A', 'G']\nstack3 = ['E', 'C']\n\n# Moves list\nmoves = []\n\n# Function to move a block\ndef move_block(source, destination, source_stack, destination_stack):\n    block = source_stack.pop()\n    destination_stack.append(block)\n    moves.append(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Move blocks to free G and I\nmove_block(2, 3, stack2, stack3)  # Move G from stack2 to stack3\nmove_block(2, 3, stack2, stack3)  # Move A from stack2 to stack3\nmove_block(2, 3, stack2, stack3)  # Move B from stack2 to stack3\nmove_block(2, 3, stack2, stack3)  # Move I from stack2 to stack3\n\n# Move G and I to stack1\nmove_block(3, 1, stack3, stack1)  # Move I from stack3 to stack1\nmove_block(3, 1, stack3, stack1)  # Move G from stack3 to stack1\n\n# Move blocks to achieve the goal state\nmove_block(3, 2, stack3, stack2)  # Move B from stack3 to stack2\nmove_block(3, 2, stack3, stack2)  # Move A from stack3 to stack2\nmove_block(3, 2, stack3, stack2)  # Move G from stack3 to stack2\nmove_block(3, 2, stack3, stack2)  # Move I from stack3 to stack2\nmove_block(1, 3, stack1, stack3)  # Move J from stack1 to stack3\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the series of moves.",
