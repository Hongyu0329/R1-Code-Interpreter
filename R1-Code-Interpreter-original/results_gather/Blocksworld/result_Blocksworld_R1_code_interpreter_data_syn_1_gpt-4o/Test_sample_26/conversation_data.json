    "To solve this problem, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B K J C\n- stack2: F H\n- stack3: D E G I A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: C D F I K\n- stack2: B H J\n- stack3: A E G\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Identify the top block of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state of each stack after each move.\n\n### Plan:\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the desired order in each stack.\n- We will move blocks from one stack to another, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate the moves required to reach the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state of the stacks\nstack1 = ['B', 'K', 'J', 'C']\nstack2 = ['F', 'H']\nstack3 = ['D', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'A']\n\n# Goal state of the stacks\ngoal_stack1 = ['C', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'K']\ngoal_stack2 = ['B', 'H', 'J']\ngoal_stack3 = ['A', 'E', 'G']\n\n# Function to print the move\ndef move(block, source, destination):\n    print(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Simulate the moves\n# Move A from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmove('A', 'stack3', 'stack2')\n\n# Move I from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmove('I', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n\n# Move G from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmove('G', 'stack3', 'stack2')\n\n# Move E from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmove('E', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n\n# Move D from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmove('D', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n\n# Move H from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmove('H', 'stack2', 'stack3')\n\n# Move F from stack2 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack2.pop())\nmove('F', 'stack2', 'stack1')\n\n# Move J from stack1 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\nmove('J', 'stack1', 'stack2')\n\n# Move K from stack1 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\nmove('K', 'stack1', 'stack3')\n\n# Move B from stack1 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\nmove('B', 'stack1', 'stack2')\n\n# Move K from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmove('K', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n\n# Move H from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmove('H', 'stack3', 'stack2')\n\n# Move G from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmove('G', 'stack2', 'stack3')\n\n# Move A from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmove('A', 'stack2', 'stack3')\n```\n\nThis script will simulate the moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's execute the code to see the sequence of moves.",
