    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. The key is to move blocks one at a time, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of any stack).\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: H G A C\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: F\n   - stack4: B D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B E G\n   - stack2: C F\n   - stack3: D H\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the desired order in each stack.\n- We can only move the top block from any stack.\n- We need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to avoid unnecessary steps.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack3 (to free B).\n2. Move B from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n3. Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to free A).\n4. Move A from stack1 to stack1 (A is already in stack1, so no move needed).\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n6. Move G from stack1 to stack1 (G is already in stack1, so no move needed).\n7. Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n8. Move H from stack1 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n\nLet's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence of moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move D from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move B from stack4 to stack1\",\n    \"Move C from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move E from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move F from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move H from stack1 to stack3\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the sequence of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, providing the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state. Here is the final answer with the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
