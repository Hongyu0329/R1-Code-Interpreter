    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only move one block at a time. Let's analyze the initial and goal states to determine the sequence of moves.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D B\n- stack2: \n- stack3: C\n- stack4: A E F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D\n- stack2: A C E F\n- stack3: \n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move F from stack4 to stack2.\n2. Move E from stack4 to stack2.\n3. Move A from stack4 to stack2.\n4. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n5. Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n6. Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n7. Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n8. Move D from stack2 to stack1.\n\nLet's implement this plan in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move F from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move E from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move A from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move C from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move B from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move D from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move B from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move D from stack2 to stack1\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the required format. The sequence of moves provided will transform the initial state into the goal state by following the rules of the Blocksworld task. \n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<Move F from stack4 to stack2\nMove E from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack2 to stack1>>>"
