    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: G F B\n- stack4: A H\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B C D E F G H\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to form the goal state.\n2. Move blocks to their respective positions in the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move H from stack4 to stack2\n- Move A from stack4 to stack3\n- Move B from stack3 to stack1\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1\n- Move G from stack3 to stack1\n- Move D from stack2 to stack1\n- Move H from stack2 to stack1\n- Move A from stack3 to stack2\n- Move C from stack1 to stack3\n- Move E from stack1 to stack3\n- Move A from stack2 to stack3\n- Move E from stack3 to stack1\n- Move C from stack3 to stack1\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move H from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move A from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move B from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move F from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move G from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move D from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move H from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move A from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move C from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move E from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move A from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move E from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move C from stack3 to stack1\"\n]\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output provides the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state. The moves are listed in the correct format, and each move is separated by a newline.\n\nHere is the final answer with the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
