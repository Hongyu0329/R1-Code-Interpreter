    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's break down the problem and determine the sequence of moves required.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: E A B C\n- stack2: \n- stack3: D F\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C E\n- stack2: B F\n- stack3: D\n\n### Analysis:\n1. We can only move the top block from each stack.\n2. We need to rearrange the blocks to match the goal state.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n3. Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n4. Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, but E should be at the bottom of stack1).\n5. Move F from stack3 to stack2.\n6. Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, but D should be at the bottom of stack3).\n7. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n8. Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n\nLet's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence of moves\nmoves = [\n    \"Move C from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move B from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move A from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move F from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move A from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move C from stack2 to stack1\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the sequence of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected format. However, upon reviewing the sequence of moves, I realized that the solution does not correctly achieve the goal state. Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure the correct sequence of moves.\n\n### Correct Steps to Solve:\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n3. Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n4. Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, but E should be at the bottom of stack1).\n5. Move F from stack3 to stack2.\n6. Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, but D should be at the bottom of stack3).\n7. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n8.
