    "To solve this problem, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. We will carefully plan each move to achieve the desired configuration.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: A I G\n- stack3: C B\n- stack4: K F J H\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C D G\n- stack2: E F H I J K\n- stack3: B\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the moves:\n\n1. Move H from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move J from stack4 to stack2\n3. Move F from stack4 to stack2\n4. Move K from stack4 to stack2\n5. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n6. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move I from stack2 to stack2\n9. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n10. Move E from stack1 to stack2\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move H from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move J from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move F from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move K from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move B from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move C from 3 to 1\",\n    \"Move G from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move I from 2 to 2\",\n    \"Move A from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move E from 1 to 2\"\n]\n\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will print the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's execute it to verify the solution.",
