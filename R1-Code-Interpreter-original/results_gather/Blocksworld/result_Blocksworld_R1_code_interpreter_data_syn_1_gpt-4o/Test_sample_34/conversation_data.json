    "To solve this problem, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: G E B\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: C D H F\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: D F G\n- stack2: A C E H\n- stack3: B\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to eventually place it under G).\n- Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to eventually place it under E).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to eventually place it under F).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to eventually place it under A).\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n- Move E from stack1 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n- Move G from stack1 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the moves are correct and achieve the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstack1 = ['G', 'E', 'B']\nstack2 = ['A']\nstack3 = ['C', 'D', 'H', 'F']\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move F from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move F from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move H from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move H from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move D from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move C from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move B from stack1 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Move E from stack1 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 1 to 2\")\n\n# Move G from stack1 to stack1 (no actual move needed, just for clarity)\n# This is to show that G is already in the correct position\nmoves.append(\"Move G from 1 to 1\")\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the planned moves and print them in the required format. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the moves were printed in the required format. Now, let's present the final answer with the moves to transform the initial state into the goal state.\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove G from 1 to 1\n>>>"
