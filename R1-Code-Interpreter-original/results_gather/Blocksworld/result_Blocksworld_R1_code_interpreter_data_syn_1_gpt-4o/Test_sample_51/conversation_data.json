    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: G A H\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: I C B\n   - stack4: F D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B C D G H I\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: F\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n- We need to move blocks to form the sequence A B C D G H I in stack1.\n- We need to ensure that stack2 and stack3 have E and F, respectively.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack1.\n2. Move F from stack4 to stack3.\n3. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n4. Move C from stack3 to stack1.\n5. Move I from stack3 to stack1.\n6.
