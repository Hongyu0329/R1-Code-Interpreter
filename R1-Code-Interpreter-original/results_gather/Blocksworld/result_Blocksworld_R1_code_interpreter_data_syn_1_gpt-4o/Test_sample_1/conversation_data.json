    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: A B\n- stack3: D\n- stack4: C E\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: A D E\n- stack3: B C\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move E from stack4 to stack1 to free up C.\n2. Move C from stack4 to stack3 to start forming the goal stack3.\n3. Move D from stack3 to stack2 to start forming the goal stack2.\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack3 to complete the goal stack3.\n5. Move E from stack1 to stack2 to complete the goal stack2.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the moves are correct:\n\n```python\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': [],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'B'],\n    'stack3': ['D'],\n    'stack4': ['C', 'E']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': [],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'D', 'E'],\n    'stack3': ['B', 'C']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move E from stack4 to stack1\",\n    \"Move C from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move D from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move B from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move E from stack1 to stack2\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\n>>>"
