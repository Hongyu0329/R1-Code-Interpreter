    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D E G\n- stack2: C B A\n- stack3: F H\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B E G\n- stack2: C D H\n- stack3: A F\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Determine the sequence of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n\n### Steps:\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. Let's start by analyzing the differences between the initial and goal states.\n\n1. **Move A from stack2 to stack3**: This will free up B to be moved to stack1.\n2. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: This places B in its correct position in stack1.\n3. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: This places D in its correct position in stack2.\n4. **Move H from stack3 to stack2**: This places H in its correct position in stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move A from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move B from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move D from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move H from stack3 to stack2\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves in the required format\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves was generated correctly. Now, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
