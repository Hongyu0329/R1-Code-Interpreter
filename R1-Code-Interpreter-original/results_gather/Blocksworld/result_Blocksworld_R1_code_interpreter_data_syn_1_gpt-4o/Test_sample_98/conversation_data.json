    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules provided. Let's break down the problem and determine the sequence of moves required.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: A E\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: C B\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B E\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: D\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify the top blocks**: \n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: B\n\n2. **Goal Analysis**:\n   - stack1 should end with A B E, which means B needs to be moved to stack1.\n   - stack2 should have C, which means C needs to be moved to stack2.\n   - stack3 should have D, which means D needs to be moved to stack3.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n\nLet's implement this plan step by step.\n\n```python\n# Initial State\nstack1 = ['A', 'E']\nstack2 = ['D']\nstack3 = ['C', 'B']\n\n# Moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Move B from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move C from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move D from stack2 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the sequence of moves required to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove D from 2 to 3\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
