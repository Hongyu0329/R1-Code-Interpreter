    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B G\n- stack2: F E A C\n- stack3: H D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B F\n- stack2: D E\n- stack3: C G H\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move G from stack1 to stack3\n- Move B from stack1 to stack2\n- Move C from stack2 to stack3\n- Move A from stack2 to stack1\n- Move E from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move F from stack2 to stack1\n- Move D from stack3 to stack2\n- Move B from stack2 to stack1\n- Move G from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move H from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nLet's implement this plan using Python code to ensure the sequence of moves is correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['B', 'G'],\n    'stack2': ['F', 'E', 'A', 'C'],\n    'stack3': ['H', 'D']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['A', 'B', 'F'],\n    'stack2': ['D', 'E'],\n    'stack3': ['C', 'G', 'H']\n}\n\n# Function to print the moves\ndef print_moves(moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        print(move)\n\n# Plan of moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move G from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move B from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move C from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move A from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move F from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move D from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move B from stack2 to stack1\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nprint_moves(moves)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves was printed as expected. Now, let's format the final answer according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
