    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by only moving the top block of any stack to another stack. We need to carefully plan the moves to ensure that we don't block any necessary moves later on.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: J C\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: H G A E D\n   - stack4: F B I\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B H\n   - stack2: A D E F G I\n   - stack3: C J\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and are on top of their respective stacks.\n   - We will use stack2 as a temporary holding area since it is initially empty.\n\nLet's start planning the moves:\n\n- Move I from stack4 to stack2\n- Move B from stack4 to stack1\n- Move F from stack4 to stack2\n- Move D from stack3 to stack2\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2\n- Move A from stack3 to stack2\n- Move G from stack3 to stack2\n- Move H from stack3 to stack1\n- Move C from stack1 to stack3\n- Move J from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move I from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move B from 4 to 1\",\n    \"Move F from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move D from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move E from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move A from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move G from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move H from 3 to 1\",\n    \"Move C from 1 to 3\",\n    \"Move J from 1 to 3\"\n]\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the series of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the series of moves to reach the goal state is provided. Let's format the final answer as required:\n\n<<<\nMove I from 4 to 2\nMove B from 4 to 1\nMove F from 4 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove C from 1 to 3\nMove J from 1 to 3\n>>>"
