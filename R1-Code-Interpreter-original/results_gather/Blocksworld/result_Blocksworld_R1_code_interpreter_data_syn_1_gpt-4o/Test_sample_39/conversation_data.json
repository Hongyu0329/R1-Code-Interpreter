    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: H B F\n- stack2: I\n- stack3: G C D\n- stack4: J A E\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C D F G\n- stack2: E J\n- stack3: B H I\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block).\n3. Keep track of the current state of each stack after each move.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to free up B and H for later moves).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n- Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n- Move E from stack4 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n- Move A from stack4 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n- Move J from stack4 to stack2 (to complete the goal stack2).\n- Move H from stack1 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n- Move I from stack2 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the moves are correct and achieve the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['H', 'B', 'F'],\n    2: ['I'],\n    3: ['G', 'C', 'D'],\n    4: ['J', 'A', 'E']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    (1, 3),  # Move F from stack1 to stack3\n    (3, 1),  # Move D from stack3 to stack1\n    (3, 1),  # Move C from stack3 to stack1\n    (3, 1),  # Move G from stack3 to stack1\n    (4, 2),  # Move E from stack4 to stack2\n    (4, 1),  # Move A from stack4 to stack1\n    (4, 2),  # Move J from stack4 to stack2\n    (1, 3),  # Move H from stack1 to stack3\n    (1, 3),  # Move B from stack1 to stack3\n    (2, 3)   # Move I from stack2 to stack3\n]\n\n# Execute moves\nmove_instructions = []\nfor source, destination in moves:\n    block = stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n    move_instructions.append(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Print the move instructions\nprint(\"\\n\".join(move_instructions))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
