You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line. Your answer: \n",

    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only use the three given stacks.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E B\n   - stack2: A D C\n   - stack3: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: A B C D E\n\n**Steps to solve:**\n\n- We need to move all blocks to stack3 in the order A, B, C, D, E.\n- We can only move the top block from each stack.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n2. Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n4. Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n5. Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n6. Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the sequence is correct:\n\n```python\n# Initial configuration\nstacks = {\n    'stack1': ['E', 'B'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'D', 'C'],\n    'stack3': []\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    ('C', 'stack2', 'stack3'),\n    ('D', 'stack2', 'stack3'),\n    ('A', 'stack2', 'stack3'),\n    ('B', 'stack1', 'stack2'),\n    ('E', 'stack1', 'stack3'),\n    ('B', 'stack2', 'stack3')\n]\n\n# Execute the moves\nfor block, source, destination in moves:\n    stacks[destination].append(stacks[source].pop())\n\n# Print the final configuration of stacks\nprint(stacks)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the sequence of moves and the final configuration.",
