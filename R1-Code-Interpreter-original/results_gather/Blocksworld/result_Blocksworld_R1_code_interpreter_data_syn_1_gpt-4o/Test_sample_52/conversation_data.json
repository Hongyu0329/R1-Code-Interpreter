    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: I J F\n- stack2: B G E C\n- stack3: H D A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B C H I J\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: A E F G\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration in each stack.\n- We will move blocks from one stack to another, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate the moves required to reach the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['I', 'J', 'F'],\n    'stack2': ['B', 'G', 'E', 'C'],\n    'stack3': ['H', 'D', 'A']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['B', 'C', 'H', 'I', 'J'],\n    'stack2': ['D'],\n    'stack3': ['A', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n}\n\n# Function to print the moves\ndef print_moves(moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        print(f\"Move {move[0]} from {move[1]} to {move[2]}\")\n\n# List to store the moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Move F from stack1 to stack3\nmoves.append(('F', 'stack1', 'stack3'))\ninitial_state['stack3'].append(initial_state['stack1'].pop())\n\n# Move J from stack1 to stack3\nmoves.append(('J', 'stack1', 'stack3'))\ninitial_state['stack3'].append(initial_state['stack1'].pop())\n\n# Move I from stack1 to stack3\nmoves.append(('I', 'stack1', 'stack3'))\ninitial_state['stack3'].append(initial_state['stack1'].pop())\n\n# Move C from stack2 to stack1\nmoves.append(('C', 'stack2', 'stack1'))\ninitial_state['stack1'].append(initial_state['stack2'].pop())\n\n# Move E from stack2 to stack3\nmoves.append(('E', 'stack2', 'stack3'))\ninitial_state['stack3'].append(initial_state['stack2'].pop())\n\n# Move G from stack2 to stack3\nmoves.append(('G', 'stack2', 'stack3'))\ninitial_state['stack3'].append(initial_state['stack2'].pop())\n\n# Move B from stack2 to stack1\nmoves.append(('B', 'stack2', 'stack1'))\ninitial_state['stack1'].append(initial_state['stack2'].pop())\n\n# Move A from stack3 to stack2\nmoves.append(('A', 'stack3', 'stack2'))\ninitial_state['stack2'].append(initial_state['stack3'].pop())\n\n# Move D from stack3 to stack2\nmoves.append(('D', 'stack3', 'stack2'))\ninitial_state['stack2'].append(initial_state['stack3'].pop())\n\n# Move H from stack3 to stack1\nmoves.append(('H', 'stack3', 'stack1'))\ninitial_state['stack1'].append(initial_state['stack3'].pop())\n\n# Move I from stack3 to stack1\nmoves.append(('I', 'stack3', 'stack1'))\ninitial_state['stack1'].append(initial_state['stack3'].pop())\n\n# Move J from stack3 to stack1\nmoves.append(('J', 'stack3', 'stack1'))\ninitial_state['stack1'].append(initial_state['stack3'].pop())\n\n# Print the moves\nprint_moves(moves)\n```\n\nThis script will generate the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
