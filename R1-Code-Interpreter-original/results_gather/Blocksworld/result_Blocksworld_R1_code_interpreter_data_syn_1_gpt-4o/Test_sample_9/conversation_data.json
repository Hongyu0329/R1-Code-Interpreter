    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: E B I\n- stack3: F D\n- stack4: C H G A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B D H\n- stack2: I\n- stack3: C E F G\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to form the goal state.\n2. Ensure that each move is valid by only moving the top block of any stack.\n3. Follow the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- We need to move blocks from stack4 to other stacks to free up A, B, D, and H.\n- We need to move blocks from stack2 and stack3 to achieve the goal configuration.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate the moves and ensure we achieve the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: [],\n    2: ['E', 'B', 'I'],\n    3: ['F', 'D'],\n    4: ['C', 'H', 'G', 'A']\n}\n\n# Goal state\ngoal = {\n    1: ['A', 'B', 'D', 'H'],\n    2: ['I'],\n    3: ['C', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n}\n\n# Function to move a block\ndef move_block(stacks, source, destination):\n    block = stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n    return f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\"\n\n# List to store the moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Move sequence to achieve the goal state\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 1))  # Move A from 4 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 2))  # Move G from 4 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 3))  # Move H from 4 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 3))  # Move C from 4 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move I from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 1))  # Move B from 2 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 1))  # Move D from 3 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 2))  # Move F from 3 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 1))  # Move H from 3 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 2))  # Move C from 3 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move E from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move G from 2 to 3\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis script will simulate the moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state.
