    "To solve this problem, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top block of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Determine the sequence of moves that will transform the initial state into the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move is valid, meaning only the top block of a stack can be moved.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: K I G\n  - stack2: A F B\n  - stack3: J E\n  - stack4: C H D\n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: B E F H\n  - stack2: A D I\n  - stack3: C G J K\n\nWe need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. Let's plan the moves:\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack2 (to free up C for moving to stack3).\n2. Move H from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n3. Move C from stack4 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n7. Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n8. Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n9. Move J from stack3 to stack3 (J is already in the correct stack).\n10. Move K from stack1 to stack3 (to complete forming the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the moves to transform the initial state to the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move D from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move H from 4 to 1\",\n    \"Move C from 4 to 3\",\n    \"Move B from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move F from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move E from 3 to 1\",\n    \"Move I from 1 to 2\",\n    \"Move G from 1 to 3\",\n    \"Move J from 3 to 3\",  # J is already in the correct stack\n    \"Move K from 1 to 3\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to see the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves was generated without any errors. However, I noticed that the move \"Move J from 3 to 3\" is redundant since J is already in the correct stack. Let's refine the sequence of moves to ensure efficiency and correctness:\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack2 (to free up C for moving to stack3).\n2. Move H from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n3. Move C from stack4 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n7. Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n8. Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n9. Move K from stack1 to stack3 (to complete forming the goal stack3).\n\nHere is the refined sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 4 to 2\nMove H from 4 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove I from 1 to 2\nMove G from 1 to 3\nMove K from 1 to 3\n>>>"
