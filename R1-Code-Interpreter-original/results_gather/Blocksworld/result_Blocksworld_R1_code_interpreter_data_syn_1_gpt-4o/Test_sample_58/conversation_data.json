    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: C D B\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: F A\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A C F\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D E\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. We can only move the top block from each stack.\n\n4. **Step-by-step Moves:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to get A at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to clear stack3 for D and E).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to get E in the correct position).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 (to clear stack1 for C and F).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to get D in the correct position).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack1 (C is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to get F in the correct position).\n\nLet's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move A from 3 to 1\",\n    \"Move F from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move E from 2 to 3\",\n    \"Move B from 1 to 2\",\n    \"Move D from 1 to 3\",\n    \"Move F from 2 to 1\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
