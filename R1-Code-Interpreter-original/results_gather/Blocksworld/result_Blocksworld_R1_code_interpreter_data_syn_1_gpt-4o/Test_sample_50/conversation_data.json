    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D E H G\n- stack2: A F I\n- stack3: B C\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: G I\n- stack2: A C D F H\n- stack3: B E\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state of each stack after each move.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move G from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed as G is already in place).\n- Move I from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move H from stack1 to stack2.\n- Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n- Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate these moves and ensure they are valid:\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstack1 = ['D', 'E', 'H', 'G']\nstack2 = ['A', 'F', 'I']\nstack3 = ['B', 'C']\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move I from stack2 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move I from 2 to 1\")\n\n# Move H from stack1 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move H from 1 to 2\")\n\n# Move E from stack1 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Move D from stack1 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack1.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 1 to 2\")\n\n# Move C from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis script will execute the moves and print them in the required format. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the moves were printed in the correct format. Now, let's present the final answer with the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state.\n\n<<<\nMove I from 2 to 1\nMove H from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 2\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
