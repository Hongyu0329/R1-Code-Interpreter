    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: G I F\n- stack3: C B H A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B C E F I\n- stack2: G H\n- stack3: A D\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure we are progressing towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no change, just a placeholder to start the process).\n- Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n- Move C from stack3 to stack1.\n- Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n- Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no change, just a placeholder to maintain order).\n- Move F from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move I from stack2 to stack1.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the sequence of moves is correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstack1 = ['D', 'E']\nstack2 = ['G', 'I', 'F']\nstack3 = ['C', 'B', 'H', 'A']\n\n# Moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move H from stack3 to stack2\nstack2.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move H from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move B from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move C from stack3 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack3.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move D from stack1 to stack3\nstack3.append(stack1.pop(0))\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Move F from stack2 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move F from 2 to 1\")\n\n# Move I from stack2 to stack1\nstack1.append(stack2.pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move I from 2 to 1\")\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the sequence of moves was generated without any errors. Now, let's format the final answer according to the required format.\n\n<<<\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove I from 2 to 1\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
