    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D C F B\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: \n- stack4: G A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B F G\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: A D\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move B from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up F to be moved next.\n2. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: This allows us to move C next.\n3. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This places C in its final position.\n4. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: This places D in its final position.\n5. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This allows us to move C back to stack2.\n6. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: This places C in its final position.\n7. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: This places E in its final position.\n8. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: This places F in its final position.\n9. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This places B in its final position.\n10. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: This places A in its final position.\n11. **Move G from stack4 to stack1**: This places G in its final position.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove G from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Blocksworld Task:\n\nInitial State:\nstack1: D C F B\nstack2: E\nstack3: \nstack4: G A\n\nGoal State:\nstack1: B F G\nstack2: C E\nstack3: A D\n\nPlease provide a series of moves to reach the goal state.
