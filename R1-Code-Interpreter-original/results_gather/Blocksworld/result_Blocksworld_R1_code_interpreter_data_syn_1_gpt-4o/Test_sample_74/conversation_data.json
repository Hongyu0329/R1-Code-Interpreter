    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules provided. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B G F\n- stack2: A E C\n- stack3: D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: D F G\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A B C\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move D to stack1**: This will start forming the base of the goal stack1.\n2. **Move F to stack3**: This will clear the way for G to be moved to stack1.\n3. **Move G to stack1**: This will complete the top of the goal stack1.\n4. **Move F back to stack1**: This will complete the middle of the goal stack1.\n5. **Move C to stack3**: This will start forming the base of the goal stack3.\n6. **Move E to stack2**: This will complete the goal stack2.\n7. **Move A to stack3**: This will complete the middle of the goal stack3.\n8. **Move B to stack3**: This will complete the top of the goal stack3.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the moves are valid and achieve the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['B', 'G', 'F'],\n    2: ['A', 'E', 'C'],\n    3: ['D']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move D from stack3 to stack1\nstacks[1].append(stacks[3].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move F from stack1 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[1].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move F from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Move G from stack1 to stack1\nstacks[1].append(stacks[1].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move G from 1 to 1\")\n\n# Move F from stack3 to stack1\nstacks[1].append(stacks[3].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move F from 3 to 1\")\n\n# Move C from stack2 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[2].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move E from stack2 to stack2\nstacks[2].append(stacks[2].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 2 to 2\")\n\n# Move A from stack2 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[2].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move A from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move B from stack1 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[1].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the moves and ensure they achieve the goal state.",
