    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We have four stacks, and we can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D A\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: \n   - stack4: E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: A C D E\n   - stack3: B\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n- **Step 1:** Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n- **Step 2:** Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n- **Step 3:** Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n- **Step 4:** Move E from stack4 to stack2.\n- **Step 5:** Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move D from 1 to 3\",\n    \"Move A from 1 to 2\",\n    \"Move D from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move E from 4 to 2\",\n    \"Move B from 2 to 3\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
