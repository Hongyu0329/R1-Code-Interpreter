    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: C F\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: A B E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: E F\n   - stack2: A B C D\n   - stack3: \n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration. The goal is to have E and F on stack1, and A, B, C, D on stack2, with stack3 being empty.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state on stack1).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state on stack2).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal state on stack2).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal state on stack2).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack2 (D is already in the correct position, so no move is needed, but we can consider it as a placeholder for clarity).\n   - Now, stack1 has E and F, and stack2 has A, B, C, D, with stack3 empty.\n\nLet's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\n# Define the moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move E from 3 to 1\",\n    \"Move B from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move A from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move C from 1 to 2\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's summarize the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 2\n>>>"
