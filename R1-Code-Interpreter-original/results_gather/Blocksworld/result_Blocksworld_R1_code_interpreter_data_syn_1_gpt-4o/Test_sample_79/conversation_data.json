    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F H\n- stack2: G D\n- stack3: E C B\n- stack4: A I\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: D F\n- stack2: B C E\n- stack3: A G H I\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move D to stack1**: This will help in forming the bottom of stack1 as per the goal state.\n2. **Move B to stack2**: This will help in forming the bottom of stack2 as per the goal state.\n3. **Move C to stack2**: This will help in forming the middle of stack2 as per the goal state.\n4. **Move E to stack2**: This will help in forming the top of stack2 as per the goal state.\n5. **Move G to stack3**: This will help in forming the bottom of stack3 as per the goal state.\n6. **Move H to stack3**: This will help in forming the middle of stack3 as per the goal state.\n7. **Move I to stack3**: This will help in forming the top of stack3 as per the goal state.\n8. **Move A to stack3**: This will help in forming the bottom of stack3 as per the goal state.\n\nLet's execute these steps in the correct order:\n\n```python\n# Initial State\nstacks = {\n    1: ['F', 'H'],\n    2: ['G', 'D'],\n    3: ['E', 'C', 'B'],\n    4: ['A', 'I']\n}\n\n# Moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = []\n\n# Move D from stack2 to stack1\nstacks[1].append(stacks[2].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move D from 2 to 1\")\n\n# Move B from stack3 to stack2\nstacks[2].append(stacks[3].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move B from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move C from stack3 to stack2\nstacks[2].append(stacks[3].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move C from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move E from stack3 to stack2\nstacks[2].append(stacks[3].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move E from 3 to 2\")\n\n# Move G from stack2 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[2].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move G from 2 to 3\")\n\n# Move H from stack1 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[1].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move H from 1 to 3\")\n\n# Move I from stack4 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[4].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move I from 4 to 3\")\n\n# Move A from stack4 to stack3\nstacks[3].append(stacks[4].pop())\nmoves.append(\"Move A from 4 to 3\")\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
