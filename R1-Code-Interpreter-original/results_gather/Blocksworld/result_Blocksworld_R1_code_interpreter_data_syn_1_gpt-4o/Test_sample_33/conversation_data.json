    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A\n- stack2: E B D F\n- stack3: G C\n- stack4: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D E F\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: B C\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. Move F from stack2 to stack4.\n2. Move D from stack2 to stack1.\n3. Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move C from stack3 to stack4.\n6. Move B from stack3 to stack3.\n7. Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n8. Move C from stack4 to stack3.\n9. Move F from stack4 to stack1.\n\nLet's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move F from 2 to 4\",\n    \"Move D from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move B from 2 to 3\",\n    \"Move E from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move C from 3 to 4\",\n    \"Move B from 3 to 3\",\n    \"Move G from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move C from 4 to 3\",\n    \"Move F from 4 to 1\"\n]\n\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
    "Let's carefully analyze the steps to ensure that each move is valid and leads to the goal state.

Move B from stack3 to stack3 (this move is unnecessary and incorrect).\n7. Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n8. Move C from stack4 to stack3.\n9. Move F from stack4 to stack1.\n\nLet's correct the sequence and ensure each move is valid:\n\n1. Move F from stack2 to stack4.\n2. Move D from stack2 to stack1.\n3. Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move C from stack3 to stack4.\n6. Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n7. Move C from stack4 to stack3.\n8. Move F from stack4 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write the corrected moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move F from 2 to 4\",\n    \"Move D from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move B from 2 to 3\",\n    \"Move E from 2 to 1\",\n    \"Move C from 3 to 4\",\n    \"Move G from 3 to 2\",\n    \"Move C from 4 to 3\",\n    \"Move F from 4 to 1\"\n]\n\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the correct series of moves needed to reach the goal state.",
