    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B I\n- stack2: G F\n- stack3: C D E\n- stack4: A H\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: A D\n- stack3: B C F G H I\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to form the goal state.\n2. Move blocks to their respective positions in the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- We need to move E to stack1.\n- We need to move A and D to stack2.\n- We need to move B, C, F, G, H, and I to stack3.\n\nLet's start by moving blocks according to the plan:\n\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n7. Move A from stack4 to stack2.\n8. Move I from stack1 to stack3.\n9. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the code to simulate these moves and ensure they are correct:\n\n```python\n# Initial stacks\nstacks = {\n    1: ['B', 'I'],\n    2: ['G', 'F'],\n    3: ['C', 'D', 'E'],\n    4: ['A', 'H']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    (3, 1),  # Move E from stack3 to stack1\n    (3, 2),  # Move D from stack3 to stack2\n    (2, 3),  # Move F from stack2 to stack3\n    (2, 3),  # Move G from stack2 to stack3\n    (4, 3),  # Move H from stack4 to stack3\n    (4, 2),  # Move A from stack4 to stack2\n    (1, 3),  # Move I from stack1 to stack3\n    (1, 3)   # Move B from stack1 to stack3\n]\n\n# Execute the moves\nmove_instructions = []\nfor source, destination in moves:\n    block = stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n    move_instructions.append(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Print the move instructions\nprint(\"\\n\".join(move_instructions))\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the moves and print the instructions needed to achieve the goal state. Let's execute it to verify the solution.",
    "It seems there was an error in the sequence of moves. Let's carefully re-evaluate the steps to ensure we achieve the goal state correctly. The goal is to move blocks according to the desired final configuration, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved.\n\n### Corrected Steps:\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n2.
