    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: G I D\n- stack2: E A K\n- stack3: C B H J F\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A D F\n- stack2: B H I J K\n- stack3: C E G\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n- Move J from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n- Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n- Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n- Move K from stack2 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n- Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n- Move D from stack1 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n- Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n- Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n\nLet's implement this plan in code to ensure the moves are correct and achieve the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['G', 'I', 'D'],\n    2: ['E', 'A', 'K'],\n    3: ['C', 'B', 'H', 'J', 'F']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    (3, 1),  # Move F from stack3 to stack1\n    (3, 2),  # Move J from stack3 to stack2\n    (3, 2),  # Move H from stack3 to stack2\n    (3, 2),  # Move B from stack3 to stack2\n    (3, 3),  # Move C from stack3 to stack3\n    (2, 2),  # Move K from stack2 to stack2\n    (2, 1),  # Move A from stack2 to stack1\n    (2, 3),  # Move E from stack2 to stack3\n    (1, 1),  # Move D from stack1 to stack1\n    (1, 2),  # Move I from stack1 to stack2\n    (1, 3)   # Move G from stack1 to stack3\n]\n\n# Execute moves\nmove_instructions = []\nfor source, destination in moves:\n    block = stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n    move_instructions.append(f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\")\n\n# Print the move instructions\nprint(\"\\n\".join(move_instructions))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
