    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: G F\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A B\n- stack4: D C\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B D E\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: A C F\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up G to be moved to stack2.\n2. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: This places G in its final position.\n3. **Move E from stack2 to stack1**: This allows us to move D to stack1.\n4. **Move C from stack4 to stack3**: This allows us to move D to stack1.\n5. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: This places D in its final position.\n6. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This places B in its final position.\n7. **Move F from stack3 to stack3**: This places F in its final position.\n8. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: This places A in its final position.\n\nLet's execute these steps in code to ensure the moves are correct and follow the rules.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['G', 'F'],\n    2: ['E'],\n    3: ['A', 'B'],\n    4: ['D', 'C']\n}\n\n# Moves to achieve the goal state\nmoves = [\n    ('F', 1, 3),  # Move F from stack1 to stack3\n    ('G', 1, 2),  # Move G from stack1 to stack2\n    ('E', 2, 1),  # Move E from stack2 to stack1\n    ('C', 4, 3),  # Move C from stack4 to stack3\n    ('D', 4, 1),  # Move D from stack4 to stack1\n    ('B', 3, 1),  # Move B from stack3 to stack1\n    ('F', 3, 3),  # Move F from stack3 to stack3\n    ('A', 3, 3)   # Move A from stack3 to stack3\n]\n\n# Execute the moves\nfor block, source, destination in moves:\n    stacks[destination].append(stacks[source].pop())\n\n# Print the final stacks\nprint(stacks)\n```\n\nNow, let's see the output of the code execution to verify the final state matches the goal state.",
