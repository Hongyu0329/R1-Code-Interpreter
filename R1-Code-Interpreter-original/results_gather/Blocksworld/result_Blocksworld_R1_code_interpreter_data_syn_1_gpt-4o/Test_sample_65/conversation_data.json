    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B G I\n- stack2: F H D\n- stack3: E C\n- stack4: A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D E I\n- stack2: F G H\n- stack3: A C\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks of each stack:**\n   - stack1: I\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: A\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. The goal is to have:\n     - stack1: B D E I\n     - stack2: F G H\n     - stack3: A C\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack4 (to free up B and make room for D and E).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to make room for A in stack3).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to achieve the goal stack3).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2 (to achieve the goal stack2).\n   - Move I from stack4 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n\nLet's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move I from stack1 to stack4\",\n    \"Move D from stack2 to stack1\",\n    \"Move C from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move E from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move A from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move G from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move I from stack4 to stack1\"\n]\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide the series of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack1 to stack4\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
