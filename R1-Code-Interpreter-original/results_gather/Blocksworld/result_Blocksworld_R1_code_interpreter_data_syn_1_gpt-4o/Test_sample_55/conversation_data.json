    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the problem and find a sequence of moves that will achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: J\n- stack2: C K F E B I\n- stack3: G A\n- stack4: H D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: F G H I J\n- stack2: C D E K\n- stack3: A B\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the desired order in each stack.\n- We will move blocks from one stack to another, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate the moves and find the sequence to reach the goal state.\n\n```python\n# Initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['J'],\n    2: ['C', 'K', 'F', 'E', 'B', 'I'],\n    3: ['G', 'A'],\n    4: ['H', 'D']\n}\n\n# Goal state\ngoal = {\n    1: ['F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J'],\n    2: ['C', 'D', 'E', 'K'],\n    3: ['A', 'B']\n}\n\n# Function to move a block\ndef move_block(stacks, source, destination):\n    block = stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n    return f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\"\n\n# List to store the sequence of moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Move sequence to achieve the goal state\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 1))  # Move I from 2 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 4))  # Move B from 2 to 4\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move E from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move F from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 4))  # Move K from 2 to 4\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move C from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 2))  # Move K from 4 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 2))  # Move B from 4 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 2))  # Move C from 3 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 1))  # Move F from 3 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 1))  # Move E from 3 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 3))  # Move D from 4 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 4, 1))  # Move H from 4 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 1))  # Move G from 3 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move B from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move C from 2 to 3\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis script will generate the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.
