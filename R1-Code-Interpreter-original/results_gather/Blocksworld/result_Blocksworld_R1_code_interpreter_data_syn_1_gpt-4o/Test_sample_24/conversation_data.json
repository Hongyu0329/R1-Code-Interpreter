    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the problem and plan the moves step by step.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: I D B\n- stack2: G J A C E\n- stack3: H F\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: E H\n- stack2: A G\n- stack3: B C D F I J\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Determine the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move is valid according to the rules.\n\n### Steps:\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration in each stack.\n- We will move blocks from the top of one stack to another, ensuring that we are working towards the goal state.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate the moves and find the correct sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial configuration\nstacks = {\n    1: ['I', 'D', 'B'],\n    2: ['G', 'J', 'A', 'C', 'E'],\n    3: ['H', 'F']\n}\n\n# Goal configuration\ngoal = {\n    1: ['E', 'H'],\n    2: ['A', 'G'],\n    3: ['B', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'J']\n}\n\n# Function to move a block\ndef move_block(stacks, source, destination):\n    block = stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n    return f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\"\n\n# List to store the moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Move sequence to achieve the goal state\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 1, 3))  # Move B from 1 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 1, 3))  # Move D from 1 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 1, 3))  # Move I from 1 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 1))  # Move E from 2 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 1))  # Move F from 3 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 2))  # Move I from 3 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 2))  # Move D from 3 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 2))  # Move B from 3 to 2\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move C from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move A from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move J from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 2, 3))  # Move G from 2 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 1, 3))  # Move F from 1 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 1, 3))  # Move E from 1 to 3\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 1))  # Move H from 3 to 1\nmoves.append(move_block(stacks, 3, 2))  # Move E from 3 to 2\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis script will generate the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.
