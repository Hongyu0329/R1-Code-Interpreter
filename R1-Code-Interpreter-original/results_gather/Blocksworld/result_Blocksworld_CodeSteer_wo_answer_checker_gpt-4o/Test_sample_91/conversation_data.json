    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack in the initial state.\n2. Plan the moves to transform the initial state into the goal state, ensuring that only the top block of any stack is moved at each step.\n3. Execute the moves in sequence, ensuring that each move is valid according to the rules.\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: H C A F\n- stack4: D G\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: D E G H\n- stack2: B C F\n- stack3: A\n\nSteps to achieve the goal state:\n1. Move F from stack3 to stack2.\n2. Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no change needed, but it should be the only block in stack3).\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move H from stack3 to stack1.\n5. Move G from stack4 to stack1.\n6. Move D from stack4 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove G from 4 to 1\nMove D from 4 to 1\n>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task more systematically, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore possible sequences of moves. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n2. Use a queue to implement BFS, starting with the initial state.\n3. For each state, generate all possible valid moves and resulting states.\n4. Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n5. Continue exploring until the goal state is reached.\n6. Record the sequence of moves that leads to the goal state.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal(state):\n    return state == (('D', 'E', 'G', 'H'), ('B', 'C', 'F'), ('A',), ())\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\", tuple(map(tuple, new_state))))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal(current_state):\n            return path\n\n        for move, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\ninitial_state = (('E',), ('B',), ('H', 'C', 'A', 'F'), ('D', 'G'))\nsolution = bfs(initial_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(move)\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid and that the goal state is reached.",
