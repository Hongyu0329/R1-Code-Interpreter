    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we have to follow the rules of moving one block at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move G from stack1 to stack2\n- Move C from stack2 to stack3\n- Move A from stack2 to stack1\n- Move F from stack2 to stack3\n- Move G from stack2 to stack1\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move G from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task accurately, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state. Let's use a systematic approach to determine the correct sequence of moves:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: F A C\n- stack3: B D E\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A D G\n- stack2: \n- stack3: B C E F\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks for the goal state.\n2. Ensure that each move is valid by only moving the top block of a stack.\n3. Use a systematic approach to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move G from stack1 to stack2 (to free up stack1 for A).\n2. Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to free up A).\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state in stack1).\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to free up stack2).\n5. Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to free up stack2).\n6. Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal state in stack1).\n7. Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1 in the goal state).\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move G from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack1>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task more systematically, we can implement a search algorithm to explore different sequences of moves. A depth-first search (DFS) approach can be used to explore possible moves until the goal state is reached. We'll represent the state of the stacks symbolically and search through possible moves.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the State**: Represent the stacks as lists of lists, where each sublist represents a stack.\n2. **Define the Goal State**: Clearly define the goal state for comparison.\n3. **Implement DFS**: Use a recursive function to explore moves, backtracking when necessary.\n4. **Check Validity**: Ensure each move is valid by only moving the top block of a stack.\n5. **Track Moves**: Keep track of the sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n    return state == goal_state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    new_state = [stack[:] for stack in state]  # Deep copy of the state\n    new_state[src].pop()\n    new_state[dest].append(block)\n    return new_state\n\ndef dfs(state, goal_state, path):\n    if is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n        return path\n\n    for move in get_possible_moves(state):\n        new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n        result = dfs(new_state, goal_state, path + [move])\n        if result is not None:\n            return result\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = [['G'], ['F', 'A', 'C'], ['B', 'D', 'E']]\ngoal_state = [['A', 'D', 'G'], [], ['B', 'C', 'E', 'F']]\n\nsolution = dfs(initial_state, goal_state, [])\n\nif solution:\n    formatted_solution = \"\\n\".join(f\"Move {block} from stack{src+1} to stack{dest+1}\" for block, src, dest in solution)\n    print(f\"<<<{formatted_solution}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a depth-first search to explore possible moves and find a sequence that leads to the goal state. It prints the sequence of moves in the required format if a solution is found.",
    "To address the recursion error and improve the depth-first search (DFS) implementation, we need to incorporate a mechanism to track visited states. This will help prevent revisiting the same states and avoid infinite loops. Additionally, we need to ensure that the base case for the recursion is correctly defined to terminate the search when the goal state is reached.\n\nHere's how we can refine the code:\n\n1. **Track Visited States**: Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting them.\n2. **State Representation**: Use a tuple of tuples to represent the state, as tuples are hashable and can be added to a set.\n3. **Base Case**: Ensure the base case correctly identifies when the goal state is reached.\n\nLet's implement these improvements:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n    return state == goal_state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    new_state = [list(stack) for stack in state]  # Deep copy of the state\n    new_state[src].pop()\n    new_state[dest].append(block)\n    return tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in new_state)  # Convert to tuple of tuples\n\ndef dfs(state, goal_state, path, visited):\n    if is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n        return path\n\n    visited.add(state)\n\n    for move in get_possible_moves(state):\n        new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            result = dfs(new_state, goal_state, path + [move], visited)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = (('G',), ('F', 'A', 'C'), ('B', 'D', 'E'))\ngoal_state = (('A', 'D', 'G'), (), ('B', 'C', 'E', 'F'))\n\nsolution = dfs(initial_state, goal_state, [], set())\n\nif solution:\n    formatted_solution = \"\\n\".join(f\"Move {block} from stack{src+1} to stack{dest+1}\" for block, src, dest in solution)\n    print(f\"<<<{formatted_solution}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis refined code uses a set to track visited states and represents states as tuples of tuples, which are hashable.

    "To address the recursion error and improve the search strategy, we can implement an Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) approach. IDDFS combines the space efficiency of DFS with the completeness of BFS by incrementally increasing the depth limit until the goal is found. This approach helps manage the depth of the search and prevents excessive recursion depth.\n\nHere's how we can refine the code using IDDFS:\n\n1. **Iterative Deepening**: Incrementally increase the depth limit and perform a depth-limited search.\n2. **Depth-Limited Search**: Perform DFS up to a specified depth limit.\n3. **State Representation**: Use tuples to represent states for efficient comparison and storage.\n\nLet's implement these improvements:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n    return state == goal_state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    new_state = [list(stack) for stack in state]  # Deep copy of the state\n    new_state[src].pop()\n    new_state[dest].append(block)\n    return tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in new_state)  # Convert to tuple of tuples\n\ndef depth_limited_search(state, goal_state, path, depth_limit, visited):\n    if is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n        return path\n    if depth_limit == 0:\n        return None\n\n    visited.add(state)\n\n    for move in get_possible_moves(state):\n        new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n        if new_state not in visited:\n            result = depth_limited_search(new_state, goal_state, path + [move], depth_limit - 1, visited)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n\n    visited.remove(state)\n    return None\n\ndef iterative_deepening_dfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    depth = 0\n    while True:\n        visited = set()\n        result = depth_limited_search(initial_state, goal_state, [], depth, visited)\n        if result is not None:\n            return result\n        depth += 1\n\ninitial_state = (('G',), ('F', 'A', 'C'), ('B', 'D', 'E'))\ngoal_state = (('A', 'D', 'G'), (), ('B', 'C', 'E', 'F'))\n\nsolution = iterative_deepening_dfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    formatted_solution = \"\\n\".join(f\"Move {block} from stack{src+1} to stack{dest+1}\" for block, src, dest in solution)\n    print(f\"<<<{formatted_solution}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses IDDFS to manage the search depth effectively, preventing excessive recursion depth.
