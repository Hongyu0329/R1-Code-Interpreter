    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps needed to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Identify the top block of each stack and determine where it needs to go according to the goal state.\n2. Move blocks strategically to free up the necessary blocks and place them in their correct positions.\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves step by step:\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack3\n2. Move E from stack4 to stack3\n3. Move G from stack4 to stack3\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack4\n5. Move K from stack2 to stack4\n6. Move I from stack2 to stack4\n7. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n8. Move B from stack1 to stack2\n9. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n10. Move J from stack1 to stack2\n11. Move H from stack1 to stack2\n12. Move I from stack4 to stack1\n13. Move K from stack4 to stack1\n14. Move C from stack4 to stack1\n15. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n16. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n17. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n18. Move F from stack3 to stack2\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 4 to 3\nMove E from 4 to 3\nMove G from 4 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 4\nMove K from 2 to 4\nMove I from 2 to 4\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove B from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove J from 1 to 2\nMove H from 1 to 2\nMove I from 4 to 1\nMove K from 4 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 2>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld problem more systematically, we can simulate the environment and use a search algorithm to find the correct sequence of moves. A depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) can be used to explore possible sequences of moves. However, given the constraints and the need for a more optimal solution, we can use a simple backtracking approach to explore the state space and find a valid sequence of moves.\n\nHere's a plan to implement the solution:\n\n1. Define the initial and goal states as lists of stacks.\n2. Implement a function to check if the current state matches the goal state.\n3. Implement a function to generate possible moves from the current state.\n4. Use a backtracking approach to explore the state space and find a sequence of moves that leads to the goal state.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(stacks, goal_stacks):\n    return stacks == goal_stacks\n\ndef get_possible_moves(stacks):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j, target_stack in enumerate(stacks):\n                if i != j:  # Don't move to the same stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(stacks, move):\n    block, source, destination = move\n    stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n\ndef backtrack(stacks, goal_stacks, moves_sequence):\n    if is_goal_state(stacks, goal_stacks):\n        return True\n\n    for move in get_possible_moves(stacks):\n        apply_move(stacks, move)\n        moves_sequence.append(move)\n        \n        if backtrack(stacks, goal_stacks, moves_sequence):\n            return True\n        \n        # Undo the move\n        moves_sequence.pop()\n        apply_move(stacks, (move[0], move[2], move[1]))\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_blocksworld(initial_stacks, goal_stacks):\n    moves_sequence = []\n    if backtrack(initial_stacks, goal_stacks, moves_sequence):\n        return moves_sequence\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_stacks = [['H', 'J', 'A', 'B'], ['F', 'I', 'K', 'C'], [], ['G', 'E', 'D']]\ngoal_stacks = [['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'I', 'K'], ['A', 'H', 'J'], ['F', 'G'], []]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolution = solve_blocksworld(initial_stacks, goal_stacks)\n\n# Print the solution\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(f\"Move {move[0]} from {move[1] + 1} to {move[2] + 1}\")\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code simulates the Blocksworld environment and uses a backtracking approach to find a sequence of moves that achieves the goal state. The `solve_blocksworld` function returns the sequence of moves, which is then printed in the required format.",
    "To solve the Blocksworld problem, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you understand the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have a set of stacks with blocks, and we need to rearrange these blocks to match a specified goal configuration. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack.\n\n2. **Define the Initial and Goal States**: Represent the stacks as lists, where each list contains the blocks in a stack from bottom to top. For example, the initial state can be represented as:\n   ```python\n   initial_stacks = [['H', 'J', 'A', 'B'], ['F', 'I', 'K', 'C'], [], ['G', 'E', 'D']]\n   ```\n   And the goal state as:\n   ```python\n   goal_stacks = [['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'I', 'K'], ['A', 'H', 'J'], ['F', 'G'], []]\n   ```\n\n3. **Plan the Moves**: We need to find a sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state. This involves:\n   - Identifying which block to move and where to move it.\n   - Ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n\n4. **Implement a Search Algorithm**: Use a search algorithm like backtracking to explore possible sequences of moves. The algorithm should:\n   - Check if the current state matches the goal state.\n   - Generate possible moves from the current state.\n   - Apply a move and recursively attempt to solve the problem from the new state.\n   - Backtrack if a move does not lead to a solution.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid sequence of moves is found, output the moves in the specified format.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically solve the Blocksworld problem and find the correct sequence of moves to achieve the goal state. If you need further assistance or a specific implementation, feel free to ask!",
    "Let's refine the previous approach by addressing potential issues and ensuring the solution is robust and correct. We'll focus on debugging, optimizing, and testing the code incrementally.\n\n### Steps to Refine the Solution:\n\n1. **Debugging**: Ensure that the logic for moving blocks and backtracking is correctly implemented. Pay attention to how moves are applied and undone.\n\n2. **Optimization**: Implement pruning to avoid unnecessary moves, such as moving a block back to its original position immediately.\n\n3. **Incremental Testing**: Start with simpler scenarios to verify the logic before tackling the full problem.\n\n4. **Output Verification**: Ensure the output format is correct and that the sequence of moves achieves the goal state.\n\nHere's the refined implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(stacks, goal_stacks):\n    return stacks == goal_stacks\n\ndef get_possible_moves(stacks):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j, target_stack in enumerate(stacks):\n                if i != j:  # Don't move to the same stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(stacks, move):\n    block, source, destination = move\n    stacks[source].pop()\n    stacks[destination].append(block)\n\ndef backtrack(stacks, goal_stacks, moves_sequence, visited_states):\n    if is_goal_state(stacks, goal_stacks):\n        return True\n\n    state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks)\n    if state_tuple in visited_states:\n        return False\n\n    visited_states.add(state_tuple)\n\n    for move in get_possible_moves(stacks):\n        apply_move(stacks, move)\n        moves_sequence.append(move)\n        \n        if backtrack(stacks, goal_stacks, moves_sequence, visited_states):\n            return True\n        \n        # Undo the move\n        moves_sequence.pop()\n        apply_move(stacks, (move[0], move[2], move[1]))\n\n    visited_states.remove(state_tuple)\n    return False\n\ndef solve_blocksworld(initial_stacks, goal_stacks):\n    moves_sequence = []\n    visited_states = set()\n    if backtrack(initial_stacks, goal_stacks, moves_sequence, visited_states):\n        return moves_sequence\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_stacks = [['H', 'J', 'A', 'B'], ['F', 'I', 'K', 'C'], [], ['G', 'E', 'D']]\ngoal_stacks = [['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'I', 'K'], ['A', 'H', 'J'], ['F', 'G'], []]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolution = solve_blocksworld(initial_stacks, goal_stacks)\n\n# Print the solution\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(f\"Move {move[0]} from {move[1] + 1} to {move[2] + 1}\")\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n\n- **State Tracking**: We use a set `visited_states` to track visited states and avoid revisiting them, which helps in pruning the search space.\n- **Move Application and Undo**: Ensure that moves are correctly applied and undone, maintaining the integrity of the stacks.\n- **Output Format**: The output is formatted to match the required specification.\n\nThis refined approach should provide a more robust solution to the Blocksworld problem. Test it with the given initial and goal states to verify its correctness."

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM does not achieve the goal state correctly. The sequence of moves needs to be carefully planned to ensure that each block is placed in its correct position according to the goal state. Consider using a more systematic approach, such as a search algorithm or symbolic computing, to explore possible sequences of moves and find an optimal solution. This will help in efficiently reaching the goal state without unnecessary moves. Try to implement a more complex and delicate code that can simulate the Blocksworld environment and find the correct sequence of moves.",

    "The current approach outlines a plan to solve the Blocksworld problem using a systematic search algorithm, which is a good start. However, the previous code execution resulted in errors, indicating that the implementation needs refinement. To improve the solution, consider the following guidance:\n\n1. **Debug the Code**: Carefully review the code to identify and fix any logical or syntactical errors that may have caused the execution failure. Pay special attention to the recursive backtracking logic and ensure that moves are correctly applied and undone.\n\n2. **Optimize the Search**: While the backtracking approach is a valid method, consider optimizing the search process by implementing additional strategies such as pruning unnecessary branches or using heuristics to guide the search more efficiently.\n\n3. **Test Incrementally**: Test the code with simpler initial and goal states to ensure that the basic logic is correct before scaling up to the full problem.\n\n4. **Enhance Output**: Ensure that the output format strictly adheres to the specified requirements, and verify that the sequence of moves indeed transforms the initial state into the goal state.\n\nBy addressing these points, you can enhance the robustness and correctness of the solution.
