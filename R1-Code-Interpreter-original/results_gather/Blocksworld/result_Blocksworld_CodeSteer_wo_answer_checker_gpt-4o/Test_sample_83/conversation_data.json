    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we must follow the order of the goal state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks to achieve the goal state, starting with the bottom-most blocks in the goal state and working upwards.\n3. Ensure that each move only involves the top block of any stack.\n4. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n1. Move G from stack1 to stack3.\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n3. Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n4. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move I from stack2 to stack3.\n7. Move H from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move K from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n9. Move J from stack4 to stack2.\n10. Move B from stack4 to stack3.\n11. Move D from stack4 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move G from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\nMove H from 2 to 3\nMove J from 4 to 2\nMove B from 4 to 3\nMove D from 4 to 3>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task accurately, we need to carefully plan each move to ensure that the final configuration matches the goal state.
