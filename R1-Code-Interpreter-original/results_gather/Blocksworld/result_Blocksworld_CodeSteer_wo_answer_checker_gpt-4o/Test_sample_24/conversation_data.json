    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rule that only the top block of each stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move F from stack3 to stack2\n- Move H from stack3 to stack1\n- Move J from stack2 to stack3\n- Move E from stack2 to stack1\n- Move C from stack2 to stack3\n- Move A from stack2 to stack2\n- Move G from stack2 to stack2\n- Move D from stack1 to stack3\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3\n- Move I from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's format these moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move F from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove J from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack2\nMove G from stack2 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove I from stack1 to stack3>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task using a more systematic approach, we can implement a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves. We'll use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to find a valid sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state. Here's how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. **Define the State**: Represent the state of the stacks as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a stack.\n\n2. **Define the Goal State**: Similarly, represent the goal state as a list of lists.\n\n3. **Define Valid Moves**: A move is valid if it involves moving the top block from one stack to another.\n\n4. **Search Algorithm**: Use DFS to explore possible sequences of moves. At each step, generate all possible valid moves and recursively explore each move until the goal state is reached.\n\n5. **Backtracking**: If a move does not lead to a solution, backtrack and try a different move.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n    return state == goal_state\n\ndef get_valid_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(state, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    new_state = [stack[:] for stack in state]  # Deep copy the state\n    new_state[src].pop()  # Remove the block from the source stack\n    new_state[dest].append(block)  # Add the block to the destination stack\n    return new_state\n\ndef dfs(state, goal_state, path):\n    if is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n        return path\n    for move in get_valid_moves(state):\n        new_state = apply_move(state, move)\n        result = dfs(new_state, goal_state, path + [move])\n        if result is not None:\n            return result\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = [['I', 'D', 'B'], ['G', 'J', 'A', 'C', 'E'], ['H', 'F']]\ngoal_state = [['E', 'H'], ['A', 'G'], ['B', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'J']]\n\nsolution = dfs(initial_state, goal_state, [])\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(f\"Move {block} from stack{src+1} to stack{dest+1}\" for block, src, dest in solution) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code defines the initial and goal states, generates valid moves, applies moves, and uses DFS to find a sequence of moves that achieves the goal state.
