    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we must follow the order of the goal state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks for the goal state.\n2. Move blocks to their correct positions according to the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move only involves the top block of any stack.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n1. Move I from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n3. Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n4. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move H from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n7. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n8. Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n9. Move G from stack4 to stack3.\n10. Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n11. Move I from stack2 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move I from 1 to 2\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove H from 2 to 3\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove G from 4 to 3\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove I from 2 to 2>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task more systematically, we can use a search algorithm to explore the possible moves and find a valid sequence that leads to the goal state. A depth-first search (DFS) approach can be used to explore the state space. Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. **Define the State**: Each state can be represented by the configuration of the stacks.\n\n2. **Define the Goal**: The goal state is the configuration of stacks as given in the problem.\n\n3. **Define the Moves**: A move consists of taking the top block from one stack and placing it on another stack.\n\n4. **Search Algorithm**: Use DFS to explore the possible moves. Backtrack if a move doesn't lead to a solution.\n\n5. **Check for Goal State**: After each move, check if the current state matches the goal state.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef move_block(state, from_stack, to_stack):\n    # Move the top block from one stack to another\n    block = state[from_stack].pop()\n    state[to_stack].append(block)\n    return block\n\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n    # Check if the current state matches the goal state\n    return state == goal_state\n\ndef dfs(state, goal_state, moves):\n    if is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n        return True\n\n    for from_stack in range(len(state)):\n        if not state[from_stack]:  # Skip empty stacks\n            continue\n        for to_stack in range(len(state)):\n            if from_stack == to_stack:\n                continue\n            # Make a move\n            block = move_block(state, from_stack, to_stack)\n            moves.append(f\"Move {block} from {from_stack + 1} to {to_stack + 1}\")\n            # Recurse\n            if dfs(state, goal_state, moves):\n                return True\n            # Backtrack\n            move_block(state, to_stack, from_stack)\n            moves.pop()\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = [['D', 'I'], ['H', 'A', 'C'], ['F', 'B', 'E'], ['G']]\ngoal_state = [['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F'], ['E', 'H', 'I'], ['G'], []]\n\n# Perform DFS to find the solution\nmoves = []\ndfs(initial_state, goal_state, moves)\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a depth-first search to explore the possible moves and find a sequence that leads to the goal state. The `move_block` function handles moving blocks between stacks, and the `dfs` function recursively explores the state space. The solution is printed in the required format.",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a sequence of moves to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state. Here's a step-by-step guide to approach this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have a set of stacks with blocks, and we need to rearrange these blocks to match a specified goal configuration. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack.\n\n2. **Define the Initial and Goal States**:\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: D I\n     - stack2: H A C\n     - stack3: F B E\n     - stack4: G\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: A B C D F\n     - stack2: E H I\n     - stack3: G\n\n3. **Plan the Moves**: We need to move blocks one at a time, ensuring that each move only involves the top block of any stack. The goal is to achieve the desired configuration in the fewest moves possible.\n\n4. **Use a Systematic Approach**: A systematic approach, such as a search algorithm, can help explore the possible moves and find a valid sequence that leads to the goal state. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) can be used to explore the state space.\n\n5. **Implement the Solution**: Write a Python script to simulate the moves and check if the goal state is achieved. The script should output the sequence of moves in the specified format.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the sequence of moves correctly transforms the initial state into the goal state.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically solve the Blocksworld task and find the optimal sequence of moves. If you need further assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task using a more robust approach, we can implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in state space problems because it explores all possible moves at the current depth level before moving deeper. This ensures that we find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nHere's how we can implement BFS for this problem:\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use a tuple of tuples to represent the state of the stacks. This allows us to use the state as a key in a dictionary to track visited states.\n\n2. **Queue for BFS**: Use a queue to explore states level by level. Each entry in the queue will contain the current state and the sequence of moves taken to reach that state.\n\n3. **Visited States**: Use a set to track visited states to avoid revisiting and getting stuck in infinite loops.\n\n4. **State Transitions**: For each state, generate all possible valid moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n\n5. **Goal Check**: After each move, check if the current state matches the goal state.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef move_block(state, from_stack, to_stack):\n    # Create a new state with the block moved\n    new_state = [list(stack) for stack in state]\n    block = new_state[from_stack].pop()\n    new_state[to_stack].append(block)\n    return tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in new_state), block\n\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n    return state == goal_state\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, moves = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal_state(current_state, goal_state):\n            return moves\n\n        for from_stack in range(len(current_state)):\n            if not current_state[from_stack]:  # Skip empty stacks\n                continue\n            for to_stack in range(len(current_state)):\n                if from_stack == to_stack:\n                    continue\n                # Generate new state\n                new_state, block = move_block(current_state, from_stack, to_stack)\n                if new_state not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_state)\n                    new_moves = moves + [f\"Move {block} from {from_stack + 1} to {to_stack + 1}\"]\n                    queue.append((new_state, new_moves))\n\n    return None\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = (('D', 'I'), ('H', 'A', 'C'), ('F', 'B', 'E'), ('G',))\ngoal_state = (('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F'), ('E', 'H', 'I'), ('G',))\n\n# Perform BFS to find the solution\nsolution_moves = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\n# Print the moves\nif solution_moves:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution_moves) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses BFS to explore the state space and find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state. The `move_block` function generates new states by moving blocks, and the BFS algorithm ensures that we explore all possible moves efficiently. The solution is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM does not correctly achieve the goal state. The sequence of moves needs to be carefully planned to ensure that each block is moved to its correct position according to the goal state. The TaskLLM should consider using a more systematic approach, possibly involving a search algorithm or symbolic reasoning, to explore the possible moves and find a valid sequence that leads to the goal state.

    "The current approach outlines a plan but lacks a concrete implementation that effectively solves the problem. The previous attempt at using a depth-first search (DFS) encountered issues, likely due to incorrect state management or recursion depth. To improve, consider implementing a more robust search algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS), which is often more suitable for finding the shortest path in state space problems like this. Additionally, ensure that the state transitions are correctly managed and that the algorithm can backtrack effectively. Focus on maintaining a clear representation of the state and goal, and use efficient data structures to track visited states to avoid infinite loops. Implement these improvements in the code to achieve a correct and efficient solution."
