You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks**: Initially, the top blocks are B (stack2) and D (stack3).\n2. **Plan the moves**: We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We will move blocks one at a time, ensuring that we only move the top block from any stack.\n\n### Steps to achieve the goal state:\n\n- **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: This aligns with the goal state where D is in stack1.\n- **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: This clears the way for other blocks and aligns with the goal state where B is in stack3.\n- **Move C from stack2 to stack3**: This aligns with the goal state where C is in stack3.\n- **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: This aligns with the goal state where F is in stack3.\n- **Move E from stack2 to stack1**: This aligns with the goal state where E is in stack1.\n- **Move A from stack2 to stack1**: This aligns with the goal state where A is in stack1.\n- **Move G from stack2 to stack2**: G is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 3 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transition from the initial state to the goal state.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect because it does not achieve the goal state as specified. The sequence of moves does not correctly place all blocks in their required positions. To improve the solution, TaskLLM should consider using a more systematic approach to plan the moves, such as using a search algorithm or symbolic computing to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to the goal state. Encourage TaskLLM to implement a more complex and efficient code that can handle the constraints and find the optimal sequence of moves.",
