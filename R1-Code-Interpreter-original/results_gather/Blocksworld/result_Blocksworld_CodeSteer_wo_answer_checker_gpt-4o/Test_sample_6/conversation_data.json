    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n- Move H from stack2 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n- Move F from stack2 to stack2 (F is already in the correct position, so no move is needed).\n- Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n- Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n- Move D from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move G from 3 to 1\nMove H from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm will explore all possible states by moving blocks one at a time, ensuring that each move is valid by only moving the top block of any stack. The BFS will help us find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Define the initial and goal states.\n2. Use a queue to explore each state, starting from the initial state.\n3. For each state, generate all possible valid moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n4. Check if the new state matches the goal state. If it does, return the sequence of moves.\n5. If not, add the new state to the queue and continue exploring.\n6. Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid redundant exploration.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal_state):\n    return state == goal_state\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = [list(s) for s in state]  # Deep copy of the state\n                    new_state[i].pop()  # Remove the block from the current stack\n                    new_state[j].append(block)  # Add the block to the new stack\n                    moves.append((new_state, f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in current_state)\n\n        if state_tuple in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(state_tuple)\n\n        if is_goal_state(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = [['A', 'C'], ['E', 'D', 'B', 'H', 'F'], ['G']]\ngoal_state = [['A', 'G', 'H'], ['F'], ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E']]\n\nsolution = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses BFS to explore all possible states and find the sequence of moves to reach the goal state. Each move is validated by ensuring only the top block of a stack is moved. The solution is printed in the required format.",
    "Let's debug the BFS approach to ensure it correctly finds the sequence of moves to reach the specified goal state.

    "To improve the solution, let's implement the A* search algorithm, which uses a heuristic to prioritize moves that are more likely to lead to the goal state efficiently.
