    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack:\n   - stack1: C\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: B\n\n2. Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to match the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack2 (to complete the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3 (to match the goal state for stack3).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move B from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack3>>>\n```",
    "Let's revise the solution to use numbers for the stacks instead of stack names. Here's the corrected sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move B from 3 to 1\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove D from 2 to 3>>>\n```"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is correct in terms of the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state. However, the format of the moves does not match the required format. The moves should be specified using numbers for the stacks instead of stack names. For example, instead of \"Move B from stack3 to stack1\", it should be \"Move B from 3 to 1\". Please revise the solution to use the correct format for stack references."
