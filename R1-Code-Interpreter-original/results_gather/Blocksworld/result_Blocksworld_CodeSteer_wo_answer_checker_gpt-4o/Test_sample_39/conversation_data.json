    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by only moving the top block of any stack at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top block of each stack in the initial state.\n2. Determine the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n4. Execute the moves in a sequence that respects the constraints of the problem.\n\nLet's outline the steps to achieve the goal state:\n\n- Move E from stack4 to stack2 (to start forming stack2 in the goal state).\n- Move A from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming stack1 in the goal state).\n- Move J from stack4 to stack2 (to complete stack2 in the goal state).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming stack1 in the goal state).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming stack1 in the goal state).\n- Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1 in the goal state).\n- Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to start forming stack3 in the goal state).\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to continue forming stack3 in the goal state).\n- Move H from stack1 to stack3 (to complete stack3 in the goal state).\n- Move I from stack2 to stack3 (to complete stack3 in the goal state).\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move E from 4 to 2\nMove A from 4 to 1\nMove J from 4 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3>>>\n```"
