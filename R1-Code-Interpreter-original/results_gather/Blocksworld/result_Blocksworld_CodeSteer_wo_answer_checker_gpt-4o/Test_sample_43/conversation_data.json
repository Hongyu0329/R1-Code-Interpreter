You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D B\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: A\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D E\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: A B\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 to free up D.\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1 to achieve the goal for stack1.\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the goal for stack2.\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack3 to achieve the goal for stack3.\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\n>>>\n```",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect because it does not achieve the goal state as specified. The plan and moves need to be revised to ensure that each block is moved correctly to reach the desired configuration. Consider using a more systematic approach to determine the sequence of moves, such as a search algorithm or symbolic reasoning, to ensure the solution is both correct and efficient. Re-evaluate the initial and goal states, and generate a new sequence of moves that accurately transforms the initial state into the goal state.",
