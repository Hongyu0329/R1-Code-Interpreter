    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block).\n3. Follow the goal state requirements, moving blocks to their final positions.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n- Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state for stack2).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack3 (to start forming the goal state for stack3).\n- Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n- Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n- Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n- Move A from stack4 to stack2.\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n- Move I from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move E from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove A from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove I from stack1 to stack3>>>\n```",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM does not correctly follow the rules of the Blocksworld task, as it includes an invalid move (moving C from stack3 to stack3) and does not achieve the goal state. To improve the solution, consider using a more systematic approach to plan the moves. You can implement a search algorithm, such as depth-first search or breadth-first search, to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to the goal state. This will help ensure that all moves are valid and the goal state is achieved efficiently. Additionally, ensure that each move is clearly justified and follows the rules of only moving the top block from any stack.",
    "The current solution still contains an invalid move (moving C from stack3 to stack3) and does not achieve the goal state correctly. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach using symbolic computing or efficient search algorithms like A* or breadth-first search.
