    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we have to follow the order of the goal state.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks to achieve the desired order in the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n- Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n- Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move F from stack1 to stack2.\n- Move E from stack1 to stack1.\n- Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 1\nMove A from 1 to 2\n>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task more systematically, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves. A simple approach is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. This approach will ensure that we explore all possible moves and find the optimal sequence.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Represent the state of the stacks as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a stack.\n2. Use a queue to explore states in a breadth-first manner.\n3. For each state, generate all possible moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n4. Check if the new state matches the goal state.\n5. If the goal state is reached, return the sequence of moves.\n6. If not, continue exploring other states.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = [s[:] for s in state]  # Deep copy of the state\n                    new_state[i].pop()  # Remove the block from the current stack\n                    new_state[j].append(block)  # Add the block to the new stack\n                    moves.append((new_state, f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in current_state)\n\n        if state_tuple in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(state_tuple)\n\n        if is_goal_state(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = [['A', 'E', 'F'], ['B', 'C'], ['D', 'H', 'G'], ['I']]\ngoal_state = [['B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], ['A', 'F', 'G', 'H'], ['I'], []]\n\nsolution = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(move)\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a breadth-first search to find the sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state. Each state is represented as a list of lists, and we generate all possible moves by moving the top block from one stack to another. The solution is printed in the required format.",
    "To optimize the solution for the Blocksworld task, we can implement several improvements:\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use a more compact representation for states to reduce memory usage and improve comparison speed.\n\n2. **Pruning**: Avoid revisiting states that have already been explored. This can be done by maintaining a set of visited states.\n\n3. **Heuristics**: Use a heuristic to prioritize certain moves that are more likely to lead to the goal state. For example, prioritize moves that place blocks in their correct positions according to the goal state.\n\n4. **Efficient Data Structures**: Use a priority queue to implement a best-first search, which can be more efficient than BFS by exploring promising paths first.\n\nLet's refine the code with these optimizations:\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\ndef is_goal_state(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef heuristic(state, goal):\n    # Simple heuristic: count the number of blocks in the correct position\n    score = 0\n    for stack, goal_stack in zip(state, goal):\n        for block, goal_block in zip(stack, goal_stack):\n            if block == goal_block:\n                score += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    return -score  # Negative because heapq is a min-heap\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = [s[:] for s in state]  # Deep copy of the state\n                    new_state[i].pop()  # Remove the block from the current stack\n                    new_state[j].append(block)  # Add the block to the new stack\n                    moves.append((new_state, f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef a_star_search(initial_state, goal_state):\n    open_set = []\n    heappush(open_set, (0, initial_state, []))\n    visited = set()\n\n    while open_set:\n        _, current_state, path = heappop(open_set)\n        state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in current_state)\n\n        if state_tuple in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(state_tuple)\n\n        if is_goal_state(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            if tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in new_state) not in visited:\n                new_path = path + [move]\n                priority = len(new_path) + heuristic(new_state, goal_state)\n                heappush(open_set, (priority, new_state, new_path))\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = [['A', 'E', 'F'], ['B', 'C'], ['D', 'H', 'G'], ['I']]\ngoal_state = [['B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], ['A', 'F', 'G', 'H'], ['I'], []]\n\nsolution = a_star_search(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(move)\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses an A* search algorithm with a simple heuristic to guide the search. The heuristic counts the number of blocks in the correct position, which helps prioritize moves that align with the goal state. The use of a priority queue (`heapq`) allows us to explore the most promising paths first, improving efficiency."

    "The current solution does not achieve the goal state correctly. The moves need to be carefully planned to ensure that the blocks are moved in the correct order to achieve the desired configuration. Consider using a more systematic approach, such as a search algorithm or symbolic computing, to explore possible sequences of moves and find the optimal solution. This will help in efficiently reaching the goal state without unnecessary moves. Try to implement a more complex and delicate code that can handle the constraints and find the correct sequence of moves.",
    "The current approach using breadth-first search (BFS) is a good start, but it seems to be inefficient, leading to a timeout. To improve the solution, consider optimizing the search algorithm. You can implement techniques such as pruning unnecessary states, using a more efficient data structure for state representation, or applying heuristics to guide the search more effectively. Additionally, ensure that the code handles edge cases and optimizes the state transition process. Aim to reduce the complexity and execution time while maintaining correctness. Try to refine the code to solve the task more efficiently."
