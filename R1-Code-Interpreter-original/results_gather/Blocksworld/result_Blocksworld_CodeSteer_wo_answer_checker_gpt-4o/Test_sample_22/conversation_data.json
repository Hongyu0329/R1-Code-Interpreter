    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the stacks match the goal state.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move C from stack3 to stack1\n- Move B from stack3 to stack1\n- Move H from stack3 to stack1\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3\n- Move F from stack2 to stack3\n- Move D from stack2 to stack3\n- Move I from stack1 to stack2\n- Move G from stack1 to stack2\n- Move F from stack3 to stack2\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2\n- Move A from stack1 to stack3\n- Move D from stack3 to stack2\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move C from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove I from 1 to 2\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 2>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task using a systematic approach, we can implement a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore possible sequences of moves. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **State Representation**: Represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n\n2. **Goal Check**: Define a function to check if the current state matches the goal state.\n\n3. **Valid Moves**: Define a function to generate all valid moves from the current state. A move is valid if it involves moving the top block from one stack to another.\n\n4. **BFS Implementation**: Use a queue to explore states. Start with the initial state and explore all possible moves, adding new states to the queue. Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n\n5. **Track Moves**: For each state, track the sequence of moves that led to it.\n\n6. **Output**: Once the goal state is reached, output the sequence of moves.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef get_valid_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_valid_moves(current_state):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\ninitial_state = (('I', 'A', 'G'), ('D', 'F', 'E'), ('H', 'B', 'C'))\ngoal_state = (('B', 'C', 'H'), ('F', 'G', 'I'), ('A', 'D', 'E'))\n\nsolution = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the sequence of moves required to transform the initial state into the goal state using BFS.",
    "To optimize the search for the Blocksworld task, we can switch from a simple BFS to an A* search algorithm. A* is more efficient because it uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal, reducing the number of states that need to be explored.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **State Representation**: Continue using a tuple of tuples to represent the state, as it is immutable and hashable.\n\n2. **Heuristic Function**: Define a heuristic that estimates the cost to reach the goal from the current state. A simple heuristic could be the number of blocks not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue to explore states, prioritizing those with the lowest estimated cost (current cost + heuristic).\n\n4. **A* Implementation**: Implement the A* algorithm, keeping track of the cost to reach each state and using the heuristic to guide the search.\n\n5. **Track Moves**: As before, track the sequence of moves that lead to each state.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\ndef heuristic(state, goal):\n    misplaced = 0\n    for stack, goal_stack in zip(state, goal):\n        misplaced += sum(1 for block, goal_block in zip(stack, goal_stack) if block != goal_block)\n    return misplaced\n\ndef get_valid_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef a_star(initial_state, goal_state):\n    open_set = []\n    heappush(open_set, (0, initial_state, []))\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while open_set:\n        _, current_state, path = heappop(open_set)\n\n        if current_state == goal_state:\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_valid_moves(current_state):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                cost = len(path) + 1\n                estimated_cost = cost + heuristic(new_state, goal_state)\n                heappush(open_set, (estimated_cost, new_state, path + [move]))\n\ninitial_state = (('I', 'A', 'G'), ('D', 'F', 'E'), ('H', 'B', 'C'))\ngoal_state = (('B', 'C', 'H'), ('F', 'G', 'I'), ('A', 'D', 'E'))\n\nsolution = a_star(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis implementation uses A* to efficiently find the sequence of moves to reach the goal state. The heuristic function helps guide the search by estimating the number of misplaced blocks."

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect as it does not achieve the goal state. To improve the solution, consider using a more systematic approach to solve the Blocksworld task. Implement a search algorithm, such as depth-first search or breadth-first search, to explore possible sequences of moves. This will help ensure that the solution is both correct and efficient. Additionally, consider using symbolic computing to represent the state of the stacks and track the moves. This approach will allow for more complex and delicate code that can handle the intricacies of the task.",
    "The current implementation of the BFS algorithm is timing out, which suggests inefficiencies in the code. To improve the solution, consider optimizing the BFS implementation. Ensure that the state representation and move generation are efficient. You might want to explore using a more compact state representation or optimizing the way states are stored and checked for visits. Additionally, consider implementing a heuristic to guide the search more effectively, potentially using an A* search algorithm. This could help in reducing the search space and finding the solution more quickly."
