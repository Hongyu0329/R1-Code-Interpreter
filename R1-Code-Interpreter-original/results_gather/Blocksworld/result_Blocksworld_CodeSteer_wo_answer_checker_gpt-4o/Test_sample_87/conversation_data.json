You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move F from stack4 to stack2.\n2. Move E from stack4 to stack2.\n3. Move A from stack4 to stack2.\n4. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n5. Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n6. Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n7. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move F from stack4 to stack2\nMove E from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack1>>>\n```",

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is correct and effectively solves the Blocksworld task by moving the blocks according to the rules and achieving the goal state. Therefore, the answer can be accepted as it is."
