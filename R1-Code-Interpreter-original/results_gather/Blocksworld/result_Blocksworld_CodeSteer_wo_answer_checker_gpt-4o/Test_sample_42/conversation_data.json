Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: B C D E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: B E\n   - stack3: A C\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, it's already there).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\n>>>",
    "Let's re-evaluate the sequence of moves to ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards reaching the goal state.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is almost correct but contains a minor error in the sequence of moves. The plan and the moves should be carefully checked to ensure they align with the goal state. The move \"Move C from stack3 to stack3\" is unnecessary and should be omitted. Additionally, the move sequence should be adjusted to ensure that the blocks are moved in the correct order to achieve the goal state. Encourage TaskLLM to re-evaluate the sequence of moves and ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards reaching the goal state.",
