You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's plan the moves step by step:\n\n1. Move F from stack1 to stack3 to free up A.\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n3. Move G from stack1 to stack2 to free up stack1 for B.\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1 to place it on top of A.\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack3 to free up stack2 for G.\n6. Move G from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n7. Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n8. Move D from stack3 to stack1 to place it on top of B.\n9. Move E from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n10. Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, it's already in place).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 1\n>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task correctly, we need to carefully plan each move to transition from the initial state to the goal state.
