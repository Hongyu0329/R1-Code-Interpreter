    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we have to follow the rules of the Blocksworld task.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: C F\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: A B E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: E F\n   - stack2: A B C D\n   - stack3: \n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 to start building the goal state for stack1.\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2 to start building the goal state for stack2.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2 to continue building the goal state for stack2.\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 to continue building the goal state for stack2.\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Now, stack1 has E F and stack2 has A B C D, which matches the goal state.\n\nLet's write down the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\n>>>",
    "Let's carefully plan the moves to achieve the goal state.

    "To solve the Blocksworld problem using a more systematic approach, we can implement a search algorithm. In this case, a depth-first search (DFS) can be used to explore possible moves and check if the goal state is reached. We will represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the initial and goal states** as tuples of tuples.\n2. **Implement a function to generate possible moves** from a given state. This function will return a list of new states that can be reached by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n3. **Implement a DFS algorithm** to explore the state space. The algorithm will:\n   - Start from the initial state.\n   - Use a stack to keep track of states to explore.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n   - For each state, generate possible moves and check if any of them is the goal state.\n   - If the goal state is found, return the sequence of moves that led to it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef generate_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()  # Remove block from current stack\n                    new_state[j].append(block)  # Add block to new stack\n                    moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from stack{i+1} to stack{j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef dfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    stack = [(initial_state, [])]  # Each element is (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while stack:\n        current_state, path = stack.pop()\n        if current_state == goal_state:\n            return path\n\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(current_state)\n\n        for new_state, move in generate_moves(current_state):\n            stack.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = (('C', 'F'), ('D',), ('A', 'B', 'E'))\ngoal_state = (('E', 'F'), ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'), ())\n\nsolution = dfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(move)\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will explore the state space using DFS and print the sequence of moves to reach the goal state. Each move is printed in the required format.",
    "Let's refine the DFS implementation to ensure it correctly solves the Blocksworld task. We'll focus on ensuring valid moves, accurate state transitions, and correct goal state checking. We'll also test the algorithm with smaller problems to verify its correctness.\n\nHere's the refined approach:\n\n1. **State Representation**: Use tuples to represent stacks, ensuring immutability and easy comparison.\n2. **Move Generation**: Ensure moves are valid by only moving the top block of each stack.\n3. **DFS Implementation**: Track visited states to avoid cycles and ensure the path to the goal state is correctly recorded.\n\nLet's implement the refined solution:\n\n```python\ndef generate_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()  # Remove block from current stack\n                    new_state[j].append(block)  # Add block to new stack\n                    moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from stack{i+1} to stack{j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef dfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    stack = [(initial_state, [])]  # Each element is (state, path)\n    visited = set()\n\n    while stack:\n        current_state, path = stack.pop()\n        if current_state == goal_state:\n            return path\n\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(current_state)\n\n        for new_state, move in generate_moves(current_state):\n            stack.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\n# Test with the given problem\ninitial_state = (('C', 'F'), ('D',), ('A', 'B', 'E'))\ngoal_state = (('E', 'F'), ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'), ())\n\nsolution = dfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(move)\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **State Representation**: Each state is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n- **Move Generation**: We generate all possible moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n- **DFS Implementation**: We use a stack to explore states and a set to track visited states.
