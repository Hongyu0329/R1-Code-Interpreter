    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we must follow the order of the goal state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Move C from stack4 to stack3.\n2. Move D from stack4 to stack1.\n3. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n4. Move G from stack1 to stack2.\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move C from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
