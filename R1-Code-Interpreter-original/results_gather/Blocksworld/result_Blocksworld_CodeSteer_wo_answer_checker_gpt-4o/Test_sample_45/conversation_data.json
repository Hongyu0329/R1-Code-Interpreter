    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we need to follow the rules of moving one block at a time.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E D C\n   - stack2: F B\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: C D\n   - stack3: A B F\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\n>>>\n```",

    "Let's solve the Blocksworld task by carefully planning the moves to transition from the initial state to the goal state, ensuring that each move adheres to the rule of only moving the top block from any stack.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: E D C\n- stack2: F B\n- stack3: A\n- stack4: \n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: C D\n- stack3: A B F\n\n### Plan:\n1.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is correct and effectively solves the Blocksworld task by moving the blocks according to the rules and achieving the goal state. Therefore, no further improvements are necessary.",
    "The TaskLLM's response does not address the task at hand. Please focus on solving the Blocksworld task by providing a series of moves to transition from the initial state to the goal state. Ensure that each move adheres to the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. If needed, consider using a more systematic approach or algorithm to ensure the solution is both correct and efficient."
