Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>.

    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's plan the moves step by step:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state:\n  - Stack 1 should have blocks A, C, D, G.\n  - Stack 2 should have blocks E, F, H, I, J, K.\n  - Stack 3 should have block B.\n\n- Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move H from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move J from stack4 to stack2\n3. Move F from stack4 to stack2\n4. Move K from stack4 to stack2\n5. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n6. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move I from stack2 to stack1\n9. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n10. Move B from stack2 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move H from 4 to 2\nMove J from 4 to 2\nMove F from 4 to 2\nMove K from 4 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove I from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3>>>\n```",

Move H from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move J from stack4 to stack2\n3. Move F from stack4 to stack2\n4. Move K from stack4 to stack2\n5. Move B from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n6.
