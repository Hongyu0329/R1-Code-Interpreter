    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start building the goal stack1).\n- Move F from stack3 to stack4 (to free up stack3 for G).\n- Move G from stack4 to stack3 (to achieve the goal stack3).\n- Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to continue building the goal stack1).\n- Move H from stack2 to stack1 (to continue building the goal stack1).\n- Move D from stack2 to stack2 (D is already in the correct position, so no move is needed for D).\n- Move C from stack1 to stack1 (C is already in the correct position, so no move is needed for C).\n- Move B from stack1 to stack1 (B is already in the correct position, so no move is needed for B).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack4\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack1>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task correctly, we need to carefully plan each move to transition from the initial state to the goal state.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect as it includes unnecessary moves and does not achieve the goal state correctly. To improve the solution, consider using a more systematic approach to plan the moves. You can use a search algorithm or a symbolic reasoning method to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to the goal state. Ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards achieving the goal configuration. Focus on moving blocks in a way that builds the goal stacks incrementally, while minimizing unnecessary moves.",
    "The current solution still contains unnecessary moves and does not correctly achieve the goal state. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach using symbolic computing or efficient search algorithms like A* or breadth-first search to explore possible sequences of moves. This will help in finding an optimal path to the goal state. Focus on ensuring that each move is necessary and contributes towards achieving the goal configuration. Avoid redundant moves and ensure that the final sequence of moves correctly transforms the initial state into the goal state.",
