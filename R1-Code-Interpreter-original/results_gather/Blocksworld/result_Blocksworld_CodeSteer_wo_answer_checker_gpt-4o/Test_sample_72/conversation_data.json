    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D A E C\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: C E\n   - stack3: A B D\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - We will execute the moves one by one, ensuring that we only move the top block from any stack.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task using a more systematic approach, we can implement a search algorithm. In this case, a depth-first search (DFS) can be used to explore possible sequences of moves to reach the goal state. We'll represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples and use a stack to perform the DFS. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Define the initial and goal states.**\n2. **Implement a function to generate possible moves from a given state.**\n3. **Use DFS to explore the state space and find a sequence of moves that leads to the goal state.**\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((block, i + 1, j + 1, tuple(map(tuple, new_state))))\n    return moves\n\ndef dfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    stack = [(initial_state, [])]\n    visited = set()\n\n    while stack:\n        current_state, path = stack.pop()\n        if is_goal(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(current_state)\n\n        for block, src, dest, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            stack.append((new_state, path + [f\"Move {block} from {src} to {dest}\"]))\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = (('F',), ('B',), ('D', 'A', 'E', 'C'))\ngoal_state = (('F',), ('C', 'E'), ('A', 'B', 'D'))\n\nsolution = dfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code defines the initial and goal states as tuples of tuples, where each tuple represents a stack.

    "To solve the Blocksworld task more efficiently, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is often more suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which aligns well with our task of finding the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nHere's how we can implement a BFS solution:\n\n1. **Define the initial and goal states.**\n2. **Implement a function to generate possible moves from a given state.**\n3. **Use BFS to explore the state space and find a sequence of moves that leads to the goal state.**\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((block, i + 1, j + 1, tuple(map(tuple, new_state))))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        if is_goal(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(current_state)\n\n        for block, src, dest, new_state in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            queue.append((new_state, path + [f\"Move {block} from {src} to {dest}\"]))\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = (('F',), ('B',), ('D', 'A', 'E', 'C'))\ngoal_state = (('F',), ('C', 'E'), ('A', 'B', 'D'))\n\nsolution = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a queue to implement BFS, exploring all possible states level by level.
