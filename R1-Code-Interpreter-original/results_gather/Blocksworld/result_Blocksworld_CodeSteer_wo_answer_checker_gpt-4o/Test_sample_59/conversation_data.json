    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: F\n  - stack2: B D\n  - stack3: C E A\n  - stack4: \n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: D E\n  - stack2: B C\n  - stack3: A F\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack4 (temporary holding).\n2. Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n5. Move D from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move A from stack4 to stack3.\n7. Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove A from 3 to 4\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 1\nMove A from 4 to 3\n>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task more systematically, we can use a backtracking approach. This involves exploring different sequences of moves and backtracking when a sequence does not lead to the goal state. Here's how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. **Define the State**: Represent the current state of the stacks.\n2. **Check Goal State**: Determine if the current state matches the goal state.\n3. **Generate Moves**: List all possible moves from the current state (i.e., moving the top block from one stack to another).\n4. **Recursive Search**: For each possible move, apply the move, and recursively check if it leads to the goal state. If not, backtrack and try another move.\n5. **Backtracking**: If a move sequence does not lead to the goal state, undo the move and try another path.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(stacks, goal):\n    return stacks == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(stacks):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j in range(len(stacks)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(stacks, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    stacks[src].pop()\n    stacks[dest].append(block)\n\ndef undo_move(stacks, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    stacks[dest].pop()\n    stacks[src].append(block)\n\ndef solve(stacks, goal, moves=[]):\n    if is_goal_state(stacks, goal):\n        return moves\n\n    for move in get_possible_moves(stacks):\n        apply_move(stacks, move)\n        result = solve(stacks, goal, moves + [move])\n        if result:\n            return result\n        undo_move(stacks, move)\n\n    return None\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_stacks = [['F'], ['B', 'D'], ['C', 'E', 'A'], []]\ngoal_stacks = [['D', 'E'], ['B', 'C'], ['A', 'F'], []]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolution = solve(initial_stacks, goal_stacks)\n\n# Print the solution\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for block, src, dest in solution:\n        print(f\"Move {block} from {src + 1} to {dest + 1}\")\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a recursive backtracking approach to find a sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state. Each move is represented as a tuple `(block, source_stack, destination_stack)`, and the solution is printed in the required format.",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task using a systematic approach, we can employ a backtracking algorithm. This involves exploring different sequences of moves and backtracking when a sequence does not lead to the goal state. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this approach:\n\n1. **Define the State**: Represent the current state of the stacks as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a stack.\n\n2. **Check Goal State**: Create a function to determine if the current state matches the goal state.\n\n3. **Generate Possible Moves**: Create a function to list all possible moves from the current state. A move consists of taking the top block from one stack and placing it on another stack.\n\n4. **Apply and Undo Moves**: Create functions to apply a move to the current state and to undo a move (backtrack).\n\n5. **Recursive Search**: Implement a recursive function that:\n   - Checks if the current state is the goal state.\n   - Iterates over all possible moves, applies each move, and recursively checks if it leads to the goal state.\n   - If a move sequence leads to the goal state, return the sequence.\n   - If not, undo the move and try another path.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: If a solution is found, print the sequence of moves in the required format.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(stacks, goal):\n    return stacks == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(stacks):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j in range(len(stacks)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    moves.append((block, i, j))\n    return moves\n\ndef apply_move(stacks, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    stacks[src].pop()\n    stacks[dest].append(block)\n\ndef undo_move(stacks, move):\n    block, src, dest = move\n    stacks[dest].pop()\n    stacks[src].append(block)\n\ndef solve(stacks, goal, moves=[]):\n    if is_goal_state(stacks, goal):\n        return moves\n\n    for move in get_possible_moves(stacks):\n        apply_move(stacks, move)\n        result = solve(stacks, goal, moves + [move])\n        if result:\n            return result\n        undo_move(stacks, move)\n\n    return None\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_stacks = [['F'], ['B', 'D'], ['C', 'E', 'A'], []]\ngoal_stacks = [['D', 'E'], ['B', 'C'], ['A', 'F'], []]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolution = solve(initial_stacks, goal_stacks)\n\n# Print the solution\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for block, src, dest in solution:\n        print(f\"Move {block} from {src + 1} to {dest + 1}\")\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a recursive backtracking approach to find a sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect as it does not achieve the goal state. The moves need to be carefully planned to ensure that each block ends up in its correct position according to the goal state. Encourage TaskLLM to use a more systematic approach, possibly involving a search algorithm or symbolic reasoning, to explore different sequences of moves and find a valid solution. Suggest using a backtracking algorithm or a state-space search to explore possible moves and backtrack when a move sequence does not lead to the goal state. This will help in generating a more complex and accurate solution.",
