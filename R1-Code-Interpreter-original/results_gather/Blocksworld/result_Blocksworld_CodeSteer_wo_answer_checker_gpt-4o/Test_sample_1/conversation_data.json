    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we need to follow the rules of the Blocksworld task.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: A B\n   - stack3: D\n   - stack4: C E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: A D E\n   - stack3: B C\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack1 to free C.\n   - Move C from stack4 to stack3 to start forming the goal state for stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 to start forming the goal state for stack2.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 to complete the goal state for stack3.\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack2 to complete the goal state for stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the series of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move E from 4 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 2>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
