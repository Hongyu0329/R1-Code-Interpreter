    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we need to carefully plan each move to ensure we don't block any necessary moves later.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move D from stack2 to stack4 to free up E.\n2. Move F from stack2 to stack4 to free up D.\n3. Move E from stack2 to stack1 to start forming the goal state for stack1.\n4. Move D from stack4 to stack1 to continue forming the goal state for stack1.\n5. Move F from stack4 to stack1 to complete the goal state for stack1.\n6. Move G from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the goal state for stack2.\n7. Move B from stack2 to stack3 to achieve the goal state for stack3.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can achieve the goal state. Here is the sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 2 to 4\nMove F from 2 to 4\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove D from 4 to 1\nMove F from 4 to 1\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3>>>\n```"
