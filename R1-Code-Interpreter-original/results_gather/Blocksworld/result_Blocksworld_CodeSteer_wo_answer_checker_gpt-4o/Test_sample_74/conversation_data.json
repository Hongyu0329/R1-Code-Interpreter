    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: B G F\n   - stack2: A E C\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D F G\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: A B C\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks and rearrange them according to the goal state.\n   - We need to move D to stack1, F and G are already in stack1 but need to be rearranged.\n   - A, B, and C need to be moved to stack3.\n   - E needs to be moved to stack2.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack1\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move F from stack1 to stack2\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3>>>\n```",
    "To solve this problem systematically, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible moves and backtrack if necessary. A depth-first search (DFS) approach can be used to explore the state space of the block configurations. We'll represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State: `(('B', 'G', 'F'), ('A', 'E', 'C'), ('D',))`\n   - Goal State: `(('D', 'F', 'G'), ('E',), ('A', 'B', 'C'))`\n\n2. **Define a Function to Generate Possible Moves:**\n   - For each stack, if it is not empty, consider moving the top block to another stack.\n\n3. **Implement a DFS Algorithm:**\n   - Use a stack to keep track of states to explore.\n   - Keep a set of visited states to avoid revisiting.\n   - For each state, generate possible moves and push new states onto the stack.\n   - If a state matches the goal state, return the sequence of moves.\n\n4. **Output the Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Format the moves as specified.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef blocks_world_dfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    from collections import deque\n\n    def is_goal(state):\n        return state == goal_state\n\n    def get_possible_moves(state):\n        moves = []\n        for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n            if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n                block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n                for j in range(len(state)):\n                    if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                        new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                        new_state[i].pop()\n                        new_state[j].append(block)\n                        moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from stack{i+1} to stack{j+1}\"))\n        return moves\n\n    stack = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while stack:\n        current_state, path = stack.pop()\n        if is_goal(current_state):\n            return path\n        visited.add(current_state)\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                stack.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\ninitial_state = (('B', 'G', 'F'), ('A', 'E', 'C'), ('D',))\ngoal_state = (('D', 'F', 'G'), ('E',), ('A', 'B', 'C'))\n\nsolution = blocks_world_dfs(initial_state, goal_state)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a depth-first search to explore possible moves and find a sequence that leads to the goal state. The `get_possible_moves` function generates all valid moves from the current state, and the DFS algorithm explores these moves until it finds a solution.",
    "To optimize the search for the solution, we can implement the A* search algorithm. A* is a best-first search algorithm that uses heuristics to guide the search process, making it more efficient than a simple depth-first search. The heuristic function will estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state, helping to prioritize which states to explore.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **State Representation:**\n   - Represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n\n2. **Heuristic Function:**\n   - Use a simple heuristic: the number of blocks not in their goal position. This will help guide the search towards states that are closer to the goal.\n\n3. **A* Search Algorithm:**\n   - Use a priority queue to explore states based on the sum of the cost to reach the current state and the heuristic estimate.\n   - Keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting.\n   - For each state, generate possible moves and calculate their costs.\n\n4. **Output the Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Format the moves as specified.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef heuristic(state, goal_state):\n    misplaced = 0\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        goal_stack = goal_state[i]\n        for j, block in enumerate(stack):\n            if j >= len(goal_stack) or block != goal_stack[j]:\n                misplaced += 1\n    return misplaced\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from stack{i+1} to stack{j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef blocks_world_astar(initial_state, goal_state):\n    open_set = []\n    heapq.heappush(open_set, (0 + heuristic(initial_state, goal_state), 0, initial_state, []))\n    visited = set()\n\n    while open_set:\n        _, cost, current_state, path = heapq.heappop(open_set)\n        if current_state in visited:\n            continue\n        if current_state == goal_state:\n            return path\n        visited.add(current_state)\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                new_cost = cost + 1\n                heapq.heappush(open_set, (new_cost + heuristic(new_state, goal_state), new_cost, new_state, path + [move]))\n\ninitial_state = (('B', 'G', 'F'), ('A', 'E', 'C'), ('D',))\ngoal_state = (('D', 'F', 'G'), ('E',), ('A', 'B', 'C'))\n\nsolution = blocks_world_astar(initial_state, goal_state)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Heuristic Function:** Counts the number of blocks not in their goal position, providing an estimate of how far the current state is from the goal.\n- **Priority Queue:** Used to explore states with the lowest estimated total cost first.\n- **Visited Set:** Ensures that states are not revisited, preventing unnecessary computations.\n\nThis approach should be more efficient and find the solution faster by focusing on promising paths in the state space."

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect as it does not achieve the goal state. The sequence of moves needs to be carefully planned to ensure that each block is moved to its correct position in the goal state. Consider using a more systematic approach to solve this problem, such as implementing a search algorithm that explores possible moves and backtracks if a move does not lead to a solution. This will help in efficiently finding the correct sequence of moves. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, possibly using symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques.",
