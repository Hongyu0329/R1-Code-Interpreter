You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks**: \n   - stack1: (empty)\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Plan the moves**:\n   - We need to move D to stack1 to achieve the goal state for stack1.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 to free up stack2 for C.\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the goal state for stack2.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2 to free up E.\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the goal state for stack3.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the goal state for stack3.\n   - Finally, move A from stack2 to stack3 to achieve the goal state for stack3.\n\n3. **Execute the moves**:\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 2 to 3\n>>>\n```",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM does not correctly achieve the goal state as specified.
