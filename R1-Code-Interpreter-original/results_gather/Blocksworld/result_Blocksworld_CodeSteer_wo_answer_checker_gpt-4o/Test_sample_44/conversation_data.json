    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block of any stack at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E A B C\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: D F\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A C E\n   - stack2: B F\n   - stack3: D\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 to free up B.\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 to achieve its goal position.\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3 to free up E.\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 to achieve its goal position.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1 to achieve its goal position.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 to achieve its goal position.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 to achieve its goal position.\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 to achieve its goal position.\n\nNow, let's write the series of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 1>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
