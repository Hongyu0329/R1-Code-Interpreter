    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top block of each stack in the initial state.\n2. Plan the moves to achieve the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack is moved.\n3. Execute the moves in a sequence that gradually transforms the initial state into the goal state.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n- Move blocks from stack1 to stack2 and stack3 to free up the blocks needed in stack1 and stack2 for the goal state.\n- Move blocks from stack4 to stack3 to achieve the goal state for stack3.\n- Continue moving blocks until all stacks match the goal state.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack1\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\n>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task systematically, we can use a search algorithm like depth-first search (DFS) to explore possible sequences of moves. The goal is to find a sequence that transforms the initial state into the goal state.

At each step, move the top block from one stack to another and check if the goal state is achieved.\n\n4. **Backtrack if Necessary**: If a move doesn't lead to a solution, backtrack and try a different move.\n\n5. **Output the Sequence of Moves**: Once the goal state is reached, output the sequence of moves.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_goal_state(stacks, goal):\n    return stacks == goal\n\ndef dfs(stacks, goal, path, visited):\n    if is_goal_state(stacks, goal):\n        return path\n\n    visited.add(tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in stacks))\n\n    for i in range(len(stacks)):\n        if not stacks[i]:\n            continue\n        block = stacks[i][-1]\n        for j in range(len(stacks)):\n            if i != j:\n                new_stacks = [stack[:] for stack in stacks]\n                new_stacks[i].pop()\n                new_stacks[j].append(block)\n                state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in new_stacks)\n                if state_tuple not in visited:\n                    result = dfs(new_stacks, goal, path + [f\"Move {block} from stack{i+1} to stack{j+1}\"], visited)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = [['B', 'H', 'G', 'I', 'D'], ['A', 'F'], ['E'], ['J', 'C']]\ngoal_state = [['H'], ['A', 'B', 'D', 'G'], ['C', 'E', 'F', 'I', 'J'], []]\n\nsolution = dfs(initial_state, goal_state, [], set())\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(move)\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses DFS to explore all possible sequences of moves, checking each time if the goal state is reached.

    "\nThe current solution does not correctly achieve the goal state. The sequence of moves needs to be carefully planned to ensure that each stack matches the goal state. Consider using a more systematic approach to determine the correct sequence of moves. You can implement a search algorithm, such as depth-first search or breadth-first search, to explore possible sequences of moves and find a valid solution. This will help in efficiently finding the correct sequence of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Please revise the solution with a more complex and systematic approach.\n",
