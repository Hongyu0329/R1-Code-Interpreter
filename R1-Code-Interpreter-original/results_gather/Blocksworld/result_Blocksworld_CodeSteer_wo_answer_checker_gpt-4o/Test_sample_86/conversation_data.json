    "To solve the Blocksworld task using a search algorithm, we can implement a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible states level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **State Representation:**\n   - Each state can be represented as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n\n2. **Move Generation:**\n   - Generate all possible moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n\n3. **Goal Check:**\n   - Check if the current state matches the goal state.\n\n4. **Search Algorithm:**\n   - Use a queue to implement BFS. Start with the initial state and explore all possible moves, adding new states to the queue.\n   - Keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting them.\n\n5. **Path Tracking:**\n   - Maintain a path to track the sequence of moves leading to each state.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from stack{i+1} to stack{j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = (('B', 'C'), ('A',), ('F', 'D', 'E'))\ngoal_state = (('A', 'C'), ('F',), ('B', 'D', 'E'))\n\n# Find the sequence of moves\nsolution = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\n# Print the solution\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\")\n    for move in solution:\n        print(move)\n    print(\">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state using a breadth-first search approach."

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect. The plan and execution steps do not correctly achieve the goal state. The moves should be carefully planned to ensure that each block is moved to its correct position according to the goal state. Encourage TaskLLM to re-evaluate the sequence of moves and ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards achieving the goal state. Consider using a more systematic approach, such as a search algorithm or symbolic reasoning, to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to the goal state. This will help in generating a more accurate and efficient solution.",
    "\nTo solve this Blocksworld task, consider implementing a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves. Use symbolic computing to represent the state of each stack and efficiently search for a sequence of moves that leads to the goal state. Implement a state-space search method, such as breadth-first search or depth-first search, to systematically explore all possible moves and find the optimal sequence. This approach will help ensure that the solution is both accurate and efficient.\n"
