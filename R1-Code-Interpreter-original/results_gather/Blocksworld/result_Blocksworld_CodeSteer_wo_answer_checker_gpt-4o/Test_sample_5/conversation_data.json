    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n3. Follow the goal state order, moving blocks to their respective stacks.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to free G and start forming stack3).\n- Move G from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming stack1).\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to free F and start forming stack3).\n- Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to complete stack3).\n- Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to complete stack3).\n- Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming stack2).\n- Move E from stack2 to stack2 (E is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n- Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1).\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1).\n- Move G from stack1 to stack1 (G is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n- Move C from stack2 to stack2 (C is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n- Move E from stack2 to stack2 (E is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n- Move A from stack3 to stack3 (A is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack3 (D is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 4 to 3\nMove G from 4 to 1\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 1>>>\n```",
    "Let's carefully plan the moves to achieve the goal state from the initial state. We need to ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards reaching the goal configuration. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: This frees up G and starts forming stack3.\n2. **Move G from stack4 to stack1**: This starts forming stack1.\n3. **Move B from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up F and continues forming stack3.\n4. **Move F from stack1 to stack1**: This is a placeholder move to keep F in stack1.\n5. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: This completes stack3.\n6. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This starts forming stack2.\n7. **Move E from stack2 to stack2**: E is already in the correct position, no move needed.\n8. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This completes stack1.\n9. **Move F from stack1 to stack1**: F is already in the correct position, no move needed.\n10. **Move G from stack1 to stack1**: G is already in the correct position, no move needed.\n11. **Move C from stack2 to stack2**: C is already in the correct position, no move needed.\n12. **Move E from stack2 to stack2**: E is already in the correct position, no move needed.\n13. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: A is already in the correct position, no move needed.\n14. **Move D from stack3 to stack3**: D is already in the correct position, no move needed.\n\nNow, let's write the correct sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 4 to 3\nMove G from 4 to 1\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 1>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves should correctly achieve the goal state.",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task systematically, we can use a search algorithm to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to the goal state. A common approach is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore the state space. Here, I'll outline a plan using a simple BFS approach:\n\n1. **Define the State**: Represent the state of the stacks as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a stack.\n\n2. **Define the Goal State**: Similarly, represent the goal state as a list of lists.\n\n3. **Implement BFS**: Use a queue to explore each state. For each state, generate all possible valid moves and add the resulting states to the queue.\n\n4. **Check for Goal State**: If a state matches the goal state, return the sequence of moves that led to it.\n\n5. **Track Visited States**: To avoid revisiting states, keep a set of visited states.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = [s[:] for s in state]  # Deep copy of the state\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((new_state, f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in current_state)\n\n        if state_tuple in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(state_tuple)\n\n        if is_goal(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\ninitial_state = [['D', 'C', 'F', 'B'], ['E'], [], ['G', 'A']]\ngoal_state = [['B', 'F', 'G'], ['C', 'E'], ['A', 'D'], []]\n\nsolution = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will explore the state space using BFS and print the sequence of moves that lead to the goal state. Each move is represented in the format \"Move [block] from [source] to [destination]\".",
    "Let's refine the BFS implementation to ensure it correctly finds the sequence of moves that leads to the desired goal state. We'll verify the state representation and move generation logic to ensure accuracy.

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM does not correctly achieve the goal state. The moves listed do not result in the desired configuration of blocks in the stacks.
