    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top block of each stack.\n2. Move blocks one at a time to achieve the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move is valid by only moving the top block of a stack.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move A from stack1 to stack2\n- Move F from stack1 to stack3\n- Move D from stack1 to stack2\n- Move E from stack1 to stack2\n- Move H from stack1 to stack3\n- Move G from stack2 to stack1\n- Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move H from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 1 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 1>>>\n```",

Move blocks from stack1 to stack2 and stack3 to free up G in stack2.\n2. Move G to stack1.\n3. Arrange the remaining blocks to match the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n2. Move F from stack1 to stack3\n3. Move D from stack1 to stack2\n4. Move E from stack1 to stack2\n5. Move H from stack1 to stack3\n6. Move G from stack2 to stack1\n7.

Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n10. Move H from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nLet's write the correct sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 1 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 3\nMove F from 3 to 3\nMove H from 3 to 3>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves should correctly achieve the goal state.",
