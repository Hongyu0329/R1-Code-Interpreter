    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: C A F\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: A C D\n   - stack3: E F\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3 to free up A and C.\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack2 to start forming the goal state in stack2.\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 to continue forming the goal state in stack2.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 to achieve the goal state for stack1.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 to continue forming the goal state in stack2.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack3 to achieve the goal state for stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 to complete the goal state for stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\"\"<<<Move F from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 2>>>\"\"\")\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task using a more sophisticated approach, we can implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm will explore all possible sequences of moves to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Define the State:** Represent the state of the stacks as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a stack.\n\n2. **Define the Goal State:** The goal state is a specific configuration of the stacks.\n\n3. **Generate Possible Moves:** For each state, generate all possible valid moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n\n4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Use a queue to explore each state level by level. Keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\n\n5. **Check for Goal State:** If a state matches the goal state, return the sequence of moves that led to it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef is_goal(state, goal):\n    return state == goal\n\ndef get_possible_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for i, stack in enumerate(state):\n        if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n            block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n            for j in range(len(state)):\n                if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = list(map(list, state))\n                    new_state[i].pop()\n                    new_state[j].append(block)\n                    moves.append((tuple(map(tuple, new_state)), f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"))\n    return moves\n\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(initial_state)\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n\n        if is_goal(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in get_possible_moves(current_state):\n            if new_state not in visited:\n                visited.add(new_state)\n                queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\n# Initial and goal states\ninitial_state = (('C', 'A', 'F'), ('B',), ('D', 'E'))\ngoal_state = (('B',), ('A', 'C', 'D'), ('E', 'F'))\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\n# Print the solution\nif solution:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(solution) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses BFS to explore all possible sequences of moves from the initial state to the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid according to the rules. The solution, if found, is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution lacks the necessary complexity to effectively solve the Blocksworld task using symbolic computing or efficient searching. Consider implementing a more sophisticated approach, such as using a search algorithm like A* or breadth-first search, to explore possible sequences of moves. This will help ensure that the solution is both optimal and adheres to the constraints of the problem. Additionally, ensure that each move is valid according to the rules of only moving the top block from any stack."
