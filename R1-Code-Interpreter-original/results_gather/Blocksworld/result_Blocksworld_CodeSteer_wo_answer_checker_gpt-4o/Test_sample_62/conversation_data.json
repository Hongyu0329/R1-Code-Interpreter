    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack in the initial state.\n2. Plan the moves to transform the initial state into the goal state, ensuring that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n3. Execute the moves in sequence, ensuring that each move is valid according to the rules.\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: G A F E\n- stack3: D C H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: C G\n- stack3: A D E F H\n\nSteps:\n1. Move H from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```plaintext\n<<<Move H from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 3>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task more systematically, we can use a step-by-step approach to ensure that each block is moved according to the rules and ends up in the correct position in the goal state. Here's a plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Goal Position for Each Block**: Determine where each block needs to be in the goal state.\n2. **Move Blocks in Reverse Order of Dependency**: Start by moving blocks that have no dependencies (i.e., blocks that can be moved without affecting the position of other blocks).\n3. **Use a Stack Representation**: Simulate the stacks and perform moves while ensuring that only the top block of each stack is moved.\n\nLet's implement this plan:\n\n1. **Move H from stack3 to stack1**: This frees up C to be moved.\n2. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: C is now in its goal position.\n3. **Move D from stack3 to stack3**: D is already in its goal position.\n4. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: E is now in its goal position.\n5. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: F is now in its goal position.\n6. **Move A from stack2 to stack3**: A is now in its goal position.\n7. **Move G from stack2 to stack2**: G is already in its goal position.\n8. **Move H from stack1 to stack3**: H is now in its goal position.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```plaintext\n<<<Move H from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove H from 1 to 3>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task accurately, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves by analyzing dependencies and using a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Analyze Dependencies**: Determine which blocks need to be moved first based on their positions in the goal state. Blocks that are deeper in the stack in the goal state should be moved first.\n\n2. **Plan Moves**: Use a systematic approach to move blocks, ensuring that each move is valid and leads towards the goal state.\n\n3. **Simulate Moves**: Represent the stacks and simulate the moves to ensure correctness.\n\nLet's implement this plan:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: G A F E\n- stack3: D C H\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: C G\n- stack3: A D E F H\n\n### Steps:\n1.
