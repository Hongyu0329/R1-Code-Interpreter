    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we have to follow the rules of moving one block at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E D\n   - stack2: A B\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A E\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: C D\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack4 (empty stack).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 1 to 4\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove D from 4 to 3>>>\n```",
    "Let's revise the plan to ensure that all blocks are moved to their correct positions in the goal state without unnecessary moves. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E D\n   - stack2: A B\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A E\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: C D\n\n3. **Revised Plan:**\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack4 (to free E).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 (to make space for A).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to achieve the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 1 to 4\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove D from 4 to 3>>>\n```"

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is almost correct but contains a minor error in the plan. The move \"Move B from stack2 to stack2\" is unnecessary and should be omitted. Additionally, the move sequence should be checked to ensure it achieves the goal state correctly. Please revise the plan to ensure all blocks are moved to their correct positions in the goal state without unnecessary moves. Consider the following steps:\n\n1. Move D from stack1 to stack4.\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n4. Move D from stack4 to stack3.\n\nEnsure the moves are formatted correctly and achieve the goal state as specified."
