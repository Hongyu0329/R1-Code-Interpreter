    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we must follow the order of operations to ensure that each move is valid.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack2.\n2. Move B from stack4 to stack2 (on top of D).\n3. Move C from stack1 to stack2 (on top of B).\n4. Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no actual move, just to clarify it's already in the correct position).\n5. Move D from stack2 to stack1 (on top of E).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack1\nMove D from stack2 to stack1>>>\n```",
    "To solve the Blocksworld task correctly, we need to carefully plan each move to ensure that we achieve the goal state. Let's break down the task and find a valid sequence of moves:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n- stack4: D B\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: A\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no actual move, just to clarify it's already in the correct position).\n3. Move B from stack4 to stack2 (on top of C).\n4. Move D from stack4 to stack1 (on top of E).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move C from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack4 to stack1>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will achieve the goal state as specified.",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect because it does not achieve the goal state as specified. The moves need to be carefully planned to ensure that each block is placed in the correct position according to the goal state. The TaskLLM should consider using a more systematic approach, possibly involving a search algorithm or symbolic reasoning, to explore the possible moves and find a valid sequence that leads to the goal state. Encourage TaskLLM to implement a more complex and efficient solution that can handle the constraints and requirements of the Blocksworld task.",
