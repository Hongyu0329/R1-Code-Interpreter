    "To solve this problem, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: G B F E D A\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: C\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: C G\n   - stack2: A D E\n   - stack3: B F\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move blocks from stack1 to stack2 and stack3 to free up the blocks needed in stack1 and stack2.\n   - Move block C from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move blocks to achieve the final configuration in stack2 and stack3.\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step:\n\n- Move A from stack1 to stack2\n- Move D from stack1 to stack2\n- Move E from stack1 to stack2\n- Move F from stack1 to stack3\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3\n- Move C from stack3 to stack1\n- Move G from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move B from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n- Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 1 to 2\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 1>>>\n```",
    "To achieve the goal state, we need to carefully track the state of each stack after every move and ensure that the final configuration matches the goal state exactly.

    "To solve this problem systematically, we can simulate the process of moving blocks using a search algorithm. We'll track the state of each stack after every move and ensure that the final configuration matches the goal state exactly. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: G B F E D A\n     - stack2: \n     - stack3: C\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: C G\n     - stack2: A D E\n     - stack3: B F\n\n2. **Use a List to Represent Each Stack:**\n   - We'll use lists to represent the stacks and simulate the moves.\n\n3. **Implement a Function to Move Blocks:**\n   - Create a function to move the top block from one stack to another.\n\n4. **Track the State After Each Move:**\n   - After each move, update the state of the stacks and check if the goal state is achieved.\n\n5. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - Use a systematic approach to determine the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['G', 'B', 'F', 'E', 'D', 'A'],\n    'stack2': [],\n    'stack3': ['C']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['C', 'G'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'D', 'E'],\n    'stack3': ['B', 'F']\n}\n\n# Function to move a block from one stack to another\ndef move_block(state, source, destination):\n    block = state[source].pop()\n    state[destination].append(block)\n    return f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\"\n\n# List to store the sequence of moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Perform the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack1', 'stack2'))  # Move A\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack1', 'stack2'))  # Move D\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack1', 'stack2'))  # Move E\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack1', 'stack3'))  # Move F\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack1', 'stack3'))  # Move B\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack3', 'stack1'))  # Move C\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack1', 'stack2'))  # Move G\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack3', 'stack2'))  # Move B\nmoves.append(move_block(initial_state, 'stack3', 'stack2'))  # Move F\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code simulates the process of moving blocks to achieve the goal state. Each move is tracked, and the final sequence of moves is printed. This approach ensures that the final configuration matches the goal state exactly.",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible sequences of moves. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible configurations level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Use lists to represent the stacks in both the initial and goal states.\n\n2. **Implement BFS to Explore State Transitions:**\n   - Use a queue to manage the state transitions.\n   - Track visited states to avoid redundant exploration.\n\n3. **Define a Function to Generate Possible Moves:**\n   - For each state, generate all possible moves by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n\n4. **Check for Goal State:**\n   - After each move, check if the current state matches the goal state.\n\n5. **Backtrack to Find the Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Once the goal state is reached, backtrack to find the sequence of moves that led to it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['G', 'B', 'F', 'E', 'D', 'A'],\n    'stack2': [],\n    'stack3': ['C']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['C', 'G'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'D', 'E'],\n    'stack3': ['B', 'F']\n}\n\n# Function to check if two states are equal\ndef states_equal(state1, state2):\n    return all(state1[key] == state2[key] for key in state1)\n\n# Function to generate possible moves\ndef generate_moves(state):\n    moves = []\n    for source in state:\n        if state[source]:  # If the source stack is not empty\n            block = state[source][-1]\n            for destination in state:\n                if source != destination:  # Move to a different stack\n                    new_state = {k: v[:] for k, v in state.items()}\n                    new_state[source].pop()\n                    new_state[destination].append(block)\n                    moves.append((new_state, f\"Move {block} from {source} to {destination}\"))\n    return moves\n\n# BFS to find the sequence of moves\ndef bfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    queue = deque([(initial_state, [])])\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_state, path = queue.popleft()\n        state_tuple = tuple(tuple(stack) for stack in current_state.values())\n\n        if state_tuple in visited:\n            continue\n\n        visited.add(state_tuple)\n\n        if states_equal(current_state, goal_state):\n            return path\n\n        for new_state, move in generate_moves(current_state):\n            queue.append((new_state, path + [move]))\n\n    return None\n\n# Find the sequence of moves\nmoves = bfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nif moves:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses BFS to explore all possible sequences of moves, ensuring that we find the correct sequence to achieve the goal state. The use of a queue allows us to systematically explore each configuration, and the visited set prevents redundant exploration."
