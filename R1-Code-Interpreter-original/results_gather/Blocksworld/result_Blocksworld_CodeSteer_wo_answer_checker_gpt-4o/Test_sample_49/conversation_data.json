    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's plan the moves step by step:\n\n1. Move B from stack4 to stack3.\n2. Move F from stack4 to stack1.\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n4. Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move H from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move G from stack2 to stack1.\n7. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move B from 4 to 3\nMove F from 4 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove H from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 1>>>\n```",
    "To achieve the goal state, we need to carefully plan the moves by considering the final positions of each block and ensuring that blocks are moved in a sequence that respects the constraints of the stacks.
