    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to free up A).\n- Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n- Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n- Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n- Move E from stack4 to stack2 (to form the goal stack2).\n- Move G from stack3 to stack3 (to form the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move C from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 4 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 3>>>\n```",
    "To address the problem more effectively, we can use a systematic approach to explore possible sequences of moves. A depth-first search (DFS) algorithm can be employed to explore all possible moves until the goal state is reached. This approach will ensure that we find a valid sequence of moves to achieve the goal state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define the initial and goal states.\n2. Implement a DFS algorithm to explore possible moves.\n3. Use a stack to keep track of the current state and the sequence of moves.\n4. For each state, generate all possible valid moves and apply them.\n5. If a move leads to the goal state, record the sequence of moves.\n6. If a move does not lead to the goal state, backtrack and try another move.\n7. Continue until the goal state is reached.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef dfs(initial_state, goal_state):\n    stack = [(initial_state, [])]  # Stack to hold states and moves\n    visited = set()  # To keep track of visited states\n\n    while stack:\n        current_state, moves = stack.pop()\n\n        # Check if the current state is the goal state\n        if current_state == goal_state:\n            return moves\n\n        # Mark the current state as visited\n        visited.add(tuple(map(tuple, current_state)))\n\n        # Generate all possible moves\n        for i, stack in enumerate(current_state):\n            if stack:  # If the stack is not empty\n                block = stack[-1]  # Get the top block\n                for j in range(len(current_state)):\n                    if i != j:  # Move to a different stack\n                        new_state = [list(s) for s in current_state]\n                        new_state[i].pop()  # Remove block from current stack\n                        new_state[j].append(block)  # Add block to new stack\n\n                        # Convert to tuple for immutability\n                        new_state_tuple = tuple(map(tuple, new_state))\n\n                        if new_state_tuple not in visited:\n                            stack.append((new_state, moves + [f\"Move {block} from {i+1} to {j+1}\"]))\n\n# Define initial and goal states\ninitial_state = [[], ['B'], ['G', 'D', 'F', 'A', 'C'], ['E']]\ngoal_state = [['A', 'B', 'D', 'F'], ['C', 'E'], ['G'], []]\n\n# Find the sequence of moves\nmoves = dfs(initial_state, goal_state)\n\n# Print the moves\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(moves) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a depth-first search to explore all possible moves and find a valid sequence to reach the goal state. The `dfs` function returns the sequence of moves, which is then printed in the required format.",
    "To address the issues with the DFS implementation, we need to ensure that the states are stored as immutable tuples, which can be added to a set. Additionally, we need to ensure that the DFS logic correctly explores all possible moves and backtracks appropriately. Let's refine the code:\n\n1. Convert each stack to a tuple to ensure immutability when storing states in the `visited` set.\n2. Use a list to manage the stack of states and moves.\n3.
