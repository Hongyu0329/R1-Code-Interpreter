    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at a time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Continue moving blocks until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n1. Move I from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move B from stack4 to stack1\n3. Move F from stack4 to stack2\n4. Move D from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move E from stack3 to stack2\n6. Move A from stack3 to stack2\n7. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n8. Move H from stack3 to stack1\n9. Move C from stack1 to stack3\n10. Move J from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's present the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move I from 4 to 2\nMove B from 4 to 1\nMove F from 4 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove C from 1 to 3\nMove J from 1 to 3>>>\n```"
