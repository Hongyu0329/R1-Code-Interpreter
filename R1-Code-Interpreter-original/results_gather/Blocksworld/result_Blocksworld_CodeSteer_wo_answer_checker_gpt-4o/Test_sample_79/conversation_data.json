    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at any time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Plan the moves to transform the initial state into the goal state, ensuring that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n3. Execute the moves in sequence, ensuring that each move is valid according to the rules.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n- Move I from stack4 to stack3 (to free A for movement).\n- Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to position A in the goal stack).\n- Move H from stack1 to stack3 (to position H in the goal stack).\n- Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to position G in the goal stack).\n- Move D from stack2 to stack1 (to position D in the goal stack).\n- Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to position B in the goal stack).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to position C in the goal stack).\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to position E in the goal stack).\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```\n<<<Move I from stack4 to stack3\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2>>>\n```",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM seems to be on the right track, but it needs to ensure that each move strictly adheres to the rule of only moving the top block of any stack. Additionally, the sequence of moves should be carefully planned to avoid any unnecessary moves and to efficiently reach the goal state. Consider using a more systematic approach, such as a search algorithm or symbolic reasoning, to explore possible sequences of moves and ensure the solution is optimal. This will help in generating a more complex and efficient solution.",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM does not correctly achieve the goal state as per the rules of the Blocksworld task. The sequence of moves needs to be reevaluated to ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards reaching the goal state efficiently. Consider implementing a more sophisticated approach, such as using a search algorithm like A* or employing symbolic reasoning to explore possible sequences of moves. This will help in generating a more complex and efficient solution that adheres to the task's constraints. Please revise the solution with these considerations in mind."
