    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack in the initial state.\n2. Plan the moves to achieve the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack is moved.\n3. Execute the moves in sequence to transform the initial state into the goal state.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n- Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n- Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to free B for the next move).\n- Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to free H for the next move).\n- Move H from stack2 to stack2 (to form the goal stack2).\n- Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to form the goal stack3).\n- Move E from stack3 to stack3 (to form the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 3 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove H from 2 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 3\nMove E from 3 to 3>>>\n```",
    "Let's re-evaluate the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state. We need to ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards achieving the goal state. Here's a revised plan:\n\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n2. Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to free up stack3 for further moves).\n3. Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to free B for the next move).\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to form the goal stack3).\n6. Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to form the goal stack3).\n7. Move F from stack1 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 1>>>\n```",
    "Let's carefully plan the sequence of moves to achieve the goal state without any invalid or redundant moves. We will use a systematic approach to ensure each move is valid and contributes to reaching the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: C F\n- stack2: E B G H\n- stack3: A D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B F\n- stack2: H\n- stack3: C D E G\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to free A for the next move).\n2. Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n3. Move F from stack1 to stack2 (to free C for the next move).\n4. Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n6. Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n7. Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n8. Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move D from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3>>>\n```"

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM contains an error in the sequence of moves, particularly with the move \"Move H from 2 to 2\" and \"Move E from 3 to 3\", which are not valid moves. Additionally, the solution does not achieve the goal state as required. To improve the solution, consider using a more systematic approach to plan the moves. You can use a search algorithm or a symbolic computing method to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to the goal state. Ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards achieving the goal state. Re-evaluate the sequence of moves and ensure that each move is necessary and correctly executed.",
    "The current solution still contains an invalid move, specifically \"Move F from 1 to 1\", which does not contribute to achieving the goal state. Additionally, the sequence of moves does not correctly achieve the goal state as specified. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach using symbolic computing or search algorithms to explore possible sequences of moves. This will help ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards achieving the goal state. Encourage the TaskLLM to use a systematic approach to plan and verify each move, ensuring that the final sequence of moves correctly transforms the initial state into the goal state."
