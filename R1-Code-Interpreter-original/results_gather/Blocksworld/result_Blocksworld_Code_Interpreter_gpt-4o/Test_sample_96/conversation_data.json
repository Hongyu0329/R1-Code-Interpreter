    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks one at a time from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state while adhering to the rule of only moving the top block of any stack.\n\nLet's perform the moves step by step:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: E B J I\n- stack2: A F K C\n- stack3: D G H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A C F J K\n- stack2: D G\n- stack3: B E H I\n\nNow, let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move I from stack1 to stack3\n2. Move J from stack1 to stack3\n3. Move B from stack1 to stack2\n4. Move E from stack1 to stack2\n5. Move C from stack2 to stack1\n6. Move K from stack2 to stack1\n7. Move F from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n9. Move E from stack2 to stack3\n10. Move B from stack2 to stack3\n11. Move J from stack3 to stack1\n12. Move I from stack3 to stack1\n\nLet's write these moves in the required format: \n\n<<<\nMove I from stack1 to stack3  \nMove J from stack1 to stack3  \nMove B from stack1 to stack2  \nMove E from stack1 to stack2  \nMove C from stack2 to stack1  \nMove K from stack2 to stack1  \nMove F from stack2 to stack1  \nMove A from stack2 to stack1  \nMove E from stack2 to stack3  \nMove B from stack2 to stack3  \nMove J from stack3 to stack1  \nMove I from stack3 to stack1  \n>>>"
