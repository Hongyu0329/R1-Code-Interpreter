    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move the blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n- stack4: D B\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: A\n\n### Moves:\n\n1. Move B from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move D from stack4 to stack1\n3. Move C from stack1 to stack2\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\n>>>\n```"
