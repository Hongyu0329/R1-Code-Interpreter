    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: A E F\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: D H G\n- stack4: I\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B C D E\n- stack2: A F G H\n- stack3: I\n\nLet's determine the moves:\n\n1. Move F from stack1 to stack2\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack2\n3. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack1\n5. Move B from stack2 to stack1\n6. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n7. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n8. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n9. Move A from stack2 to stack2\n10. Move F from stack2 to stack2\n11. Move G from stack2 to stack2\n12. Move H from stack2 to stack2\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n```plaintext\n<<<\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 2\nMove G from 2 to 2\nMove H from 2 to 2\n>>>\n```"
