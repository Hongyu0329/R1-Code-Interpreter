    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: D E H G\n- stack2: A F I\n- stack3: B C\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: G I\n- stack2: A C D F H\n- stack3: B E\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move G from stack1 to stack3\n2. Move H from stack1 to stack2\n3. Move E from stack1 to stack3\n4. Move D from stack1 to stack2\n5. Move I from stack2 to stack1\n6. Move F from stack2 to stack1\n7. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move C from stack3 to stack2\n9. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n10. Move E from stack3 to stack2\n11. Move F from stack1 to stack2\n12. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n13. Move I from stack1 to stack2\n14. Move G from stack3 to stack1\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove H from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
