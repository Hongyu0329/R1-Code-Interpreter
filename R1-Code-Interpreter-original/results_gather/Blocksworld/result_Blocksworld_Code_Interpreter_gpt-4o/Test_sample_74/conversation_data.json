    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move the blocks step by step from the initial state to the goal state, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack at each step. Let's outline the moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: B G F\n- stack2: A E C\n- stack3: D\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: D F G\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A B C\n\nLet's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move C from stack2 to stack3\n3. Move E from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n4. Move A from stack2 to stack3\n5. Move B from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack3 to stack1  \nMove C from stack2 to stack3  \nMove A from stack2 to stack3  \nMove B from stack1 to stack3  \n>>>"
