For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan the moves while adhering to the rule of only moving the top block from each stack. Let's outline the series of moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: G C A F\n- stack3: B I E H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A F H\n- stack2: C G I\n- stack3: B D E\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move H from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move E from stack3 to stack2\n3. Move I from stack3 to stack2\n4. Move B from stack3 to stack3\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack1\n6. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack2\n8. Move C from stack2 to stack2\n9. Move D from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove I from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 2\nMove D from 1 to 3\n>>>"
