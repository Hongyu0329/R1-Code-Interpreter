    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan the moves while adhering to the rule of only moving the top block from each stack. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: G A H\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: I C B\n- stack4: F D\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A B C D G H I\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: F\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n1. Move H from stack1 to stack2\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack3\n3. Move G from stack1 to stack4\n4. Move D from stack4 to stack3\n5. Move F from stack4 to stack3\n6. Move B from stack3 to stack1\n7. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n8. Move I from stack3 to stack1\n9. Move F from stack3 to stack2\n10. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n11. Move G from stack4 to stack1\n12. Move A from stack3 to stack1\n13. Move H from stack2 to stack1\n\nNow, let's format these moves as required:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove H from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack4\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove F from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\n>>>\n```"
