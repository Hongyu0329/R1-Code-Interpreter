    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move blocks from the initial stacks to achieve the desired configuration in the goal state.\n2. Ensure that each move only involves the top block of a stack.\n3. Follow the constraints of moving blocks only among the existing stacks.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: F B I K A\n- stack2: H D\n- stack3: J E C G\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: C G\n- stack2: A B D E I K\n- stack3: F H J\n\n### Moves:\n\n1. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n2. Move K from stack1 to stack2\n3. Move I from stack1 to stack2\n4. Move B from stack1 to stack2\n5. Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack2\n7. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n8. Move G from stack3 to stack1\n9. Move F from stack1 to stack3\n10. Move H from stack2 to stack3\n11. Move J from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nNow, let's format these moves in the required format:\n\n```plaintext\n<<<\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove K from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\n>>>\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will transform the initial state into the goal state."
