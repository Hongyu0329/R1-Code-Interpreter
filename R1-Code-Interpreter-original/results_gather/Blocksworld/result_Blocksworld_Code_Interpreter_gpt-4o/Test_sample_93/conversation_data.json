    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks one at a time from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n2. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move H from stack2 to stack2.\n7. Move I from stack1 to stack2.\n8. Move D from stack1 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
