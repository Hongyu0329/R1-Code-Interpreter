    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move E from stack2 to stack3\n2. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n3. Move H from stack2 to stack3\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack3\n5. Move G from stack2 to stack3\n6. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n7. Move F from stack3 to stack1\n8. Move C from stack3 to stack2\n9. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n10. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n11. Move J from stack4 to stack1\n12. Move K from stack4 to stack3\n13. Move D from stack4 to stack1\n\nFollowing these steps will transform the initial state into the goal state.
