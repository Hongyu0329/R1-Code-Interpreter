    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack2\n2. Move I from stack3 to stack1\n3. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n4. Move E from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n6. Move H from stack2 to stack3\n7. Move F from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move E from stack2 to stack3\n9. Move G from stack2 to stack3\n10. Move A from stack2 to stack3\n11. Move J from stack1 to stack2\n12. Move K from stack1 to stack2\n13. Move B from stack1 to stack2\n14. Move C from stack1 to stack3\n15. Move K from stack2 to stack1\n16. Move J from stack2 to stack1\n17. Move B from stack2 to stack1\n18. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack3 to stack2  \nMove I from stack3 to stack1  \nMove G from stack3 to stack2  \nMove E from stack3 to stack2  \nMove D from stack3 to stack1  \nMove H from stack2 to stack3  \nMove F from stack2 to stack1  \nMove E from stack2 to stack3  \nMove G from stack2 to stack3  \nMove A from stack2 to stack3  \nMove J from stack1 to stack2  \nMove K from stack1 to stack2  \nMove B from stack1 to stack2  \nMove C from stack1 to stack3  \nMove K from stack2 to stack1  \nMove J from stack2 to stack1  \nMove B from stack2 to stack1  \nMove H from stack3 to stack2  \n>>>"
