    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move blocks from the stacks to achieve the desired configuration in the goal state.\n2. Ensure that only the top block of each stack is moved at any time.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: F A\n- stack2: K D E B I C\n- stack3: H J G\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: A C E F H I J K\n\nNow, let's outline the moves:\n\n1. Move G from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move J from stack3 to stack2\n3. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack3\n5. Move I from stack2 to stack3\n6. Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n7. Move E from stack2 to stack3\n8. Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n9. Move K from stack2 to stack3\n10. Move A from stack1 to stack3\n11. Move F from stack1 to stack3\n\nLet's write these moves in the required format: \n\n```plaintext\n<<<\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove J from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove K from 2 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\n>>>\n```"
