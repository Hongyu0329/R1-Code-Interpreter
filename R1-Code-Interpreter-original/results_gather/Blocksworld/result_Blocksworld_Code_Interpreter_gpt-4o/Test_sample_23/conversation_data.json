Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move D from stack3 to stack2\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack3\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n5. Move G from stack2 to stack3\n6. Move H from stack4 to stack3\n7. Move A from stack4 to stack2\n8. Move I from stack1 to stack3\n9. Move B from stack1 to stack3\n\nFollowing these steps, we can transform the initial state into the goal state. Here is the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove A from stack4 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
