You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move A from stack2 to stack3\n2. Move B from stack2 to stack1\n3. Move D from stack1 to stack2\n4. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move A from stack3 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 3\n>>>"
