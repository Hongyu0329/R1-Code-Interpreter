    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move the blocks step by step from the initial state to the goal state. Let's break down the moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: A D\n- stack2: \n- stack3: F B\n- stack4: E C\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: A B C F\n- stack3: D\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move D from stack1 to stack3\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n3. Move C from stack4 to stack1\n4. Move E from stack4 to stack1\n5. Move C from stack1 to stack2\n6. Move E from stack1 to stack3\n7. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n8. Move F from stack3 to stack2\n9. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n10. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 4 to 1\nMove E from 4 to 1\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 1\n>>>\n```"
