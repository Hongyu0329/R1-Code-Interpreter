    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move the blocks step by step from the initial state to the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: C E A\n- stack4: \n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: A F\n\nLet's determine the series of moves:\n\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack4\n2. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack2\n4. Move F from stack1 to stack3\n5. Move D from stack2 to stack1\n6. Move B from stack2 to stack2\n7. Move A from stack4 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 3 to 4\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 2\nMove A from 4 to 3\n>>>"
