    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: K D I G B J\n- stack3: H C E A F\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A E F\n- stack2: B G K\n- stack3: C D H I J\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move F from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move A from stack3 to stack1\n3. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n4. Move C from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n6. Move J from stack2 to stack3\n7. Move B from stack2 to stack3\n8. Move G from stack2 to stack3\n9. Move I from stack2 to stack3\n10. Move D from stack2 to stack3\n11. Move K from stack2 to stack3\n12. Move C from stack2 to stack3\n13. Move H from stack2 to stack3\n14. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n15. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n16. Move K from stack3 to stack2\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove J from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove K from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove H from 2 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove K from 3 to 2\n>>>"
