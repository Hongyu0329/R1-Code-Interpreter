    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state configuration.\n\nLet's execute the moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: H D\n- stack2: E J A C F\n- stack3: B I G K\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B E I J K\n- stack2: A C D F\n- stack3: G H\n\nHere is the series of moves to achieve the goal state:\n\n```\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\nMove K from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack3 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove J from stack2 to stack1\n```\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\nMove K from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack3 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove J from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
