Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks one at a time from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Move G from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move H from stack3 to stack1\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n4. Move A from stack3 to stack3\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack2\n6. Move E from stack2 to stack3\n7. Move I from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move F from stack2 to stack2\n9. Move J from stack1 to stack1\n10. Move B from stack1 to stack1\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove J from stack1 to stack1\nMove B from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
