Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move the blocks step by step from the initial state to the goal state, following the rules provided. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: E D\n- stack2: A B\n- stack3: C\n- stack4: \n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A E\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: C D\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n1. Move D from stack1 to stack4\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack3\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n5. Move D from stack4 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack1 to stack4\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\n>>>"
