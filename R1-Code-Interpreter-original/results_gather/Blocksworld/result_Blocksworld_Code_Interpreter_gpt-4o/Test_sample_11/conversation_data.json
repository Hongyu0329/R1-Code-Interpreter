    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state configuration.\n\nLet's execute the moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: E\n- stack3: B A F J\n- stack4: C G D H I\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: C D\n- stack2: E F I\n- stack3: A B G H J\n\nHere is the series of moves to reach the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove I from 4 to 2\nMove H from 4 to 3\nMove D from 4 to 1\nMove G from 4 to 3\nMove C from 4 to 1\nMove J from 3 to 3\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 3\n>>>"
