    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n3. Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n4. Move G from stack1 to stack3.\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n7. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move G from stack3 to stack1.\n9. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n10. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n11. Move C from stack2 to stack2.\n12. Move F from stack3 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack2\nMove F from stack3 to stack3\n>>>\n```"
