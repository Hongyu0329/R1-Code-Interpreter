    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks one at a time from the initial state to the goal state, following the rules provided. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: B A\n- stack2: C F G\n- stack3: D I E J H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A E I\n- stack2: B C J\n- stack3: D F G H\n\nLet's plan the moves:\n\n1. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n2. Move B from stack1 to stack3\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n4. Move G from stack2 to stack3\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n6. Move C from stack2 to stack1\n7. Move J from stack3 to stack2\n8. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n9. Move I from stack3 to stack1\n10. Move F from stack3 to stack2\n11. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n12. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n13. Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nNow, let's format the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove J from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
