    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state configuration.\n\nLet's execute the moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: A G\n- stack2: F E\n- stack3: C\n- stack4: H J I B D\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A B\n- stack2: C E G J\n- stack3: D F H I\n\nNow, let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack3\n2. Move B from stack4 to stack1\n3. Move I from stack4 to stack3\n4. Move J from stack4 to stack2\n5. Move H from stack4 to stack3\n6. Move G from stack1 to stack2\n7. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n8. Move C from stack3 to stack2\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove I from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\n>>>\n```"
