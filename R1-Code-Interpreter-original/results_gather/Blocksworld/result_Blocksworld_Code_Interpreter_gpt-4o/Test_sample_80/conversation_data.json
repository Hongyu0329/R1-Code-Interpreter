    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move F from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n3. Move A from stack3 to stack1\n4. Move I from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move G from stack3 to stack1\n6. Move D from stack2 to stack1\n7. Move H from stack2 to stack2\n8. Move J from stack1 to stack2\n\nFollowing these steps will achieve the goal state. Here is the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove I from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack2\nMove J from stack1 to stack2\n>>>"
