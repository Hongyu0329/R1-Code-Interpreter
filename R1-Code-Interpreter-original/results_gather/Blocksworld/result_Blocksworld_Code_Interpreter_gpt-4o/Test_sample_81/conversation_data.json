    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks one at a time from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: A J\n- stack3: H F C E I\n- stack4: B G\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: F I\n- stack2: A B C D G\n- stack3: E H J\n\nLet's perform the moves step by step:\n\n1. Move I from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move E from stack3 to stack3\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack2\n4. Move F from stack3 to stack1\n5. Move H from stack3 to stack3\n6. Move J from stack2 to stack3\n7. Move D from stack1 to stack2\n8. Move G from stack4 to stack2\n9. Move B from stack4 to stack2\n\nNow, let's write down the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack3\nMove J from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove G from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\n>>>"
