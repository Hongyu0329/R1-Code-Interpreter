You can only move one block at a time. And that box should be the top box of the stack. Note that from the left to the right in each stack is the order from the bottom to the top of boxes. For example, in stack A B C D, A is the bottom box and D is the top box so that you can only move D in this case. ***Be careful that you can only pick up the top box in each stack. Check this rule before your move!***. \nEach move should be in the format: 'Move [block] from [source] to [destination]'. You cannot create new stacks but only move among the existing stacks. Separate each move with a newline. Surround the answer with <<<content>>>. Answer with the required format like the example: <<<Move B from 2 to table\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2>>>\nEach action should be separated by separate line.

    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan the moves while adhering to the rule of only moving the top block from each stack. Let's outline the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: G A F E\n- stack3: D C H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: C G\n- stack3: A D E F H\n\n### Moves:\n\n1. Move H from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move C from stack3 to stack2\n3. Move D from stack3 to stack2\n4. Move A from stack2 to stack3\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack3\n6. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack3\n8. Move C from stack2 to stack1\n9. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n\nNow, let's format these moves as requested:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove G from 3 to 2\n>>>\n```"
