    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: H B F\n- stack2: I\n- stack3: G C D\n- stack4: J A E\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A C D F G\n- stack2: E J\n- stack3: B H I\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move E from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move A from stack4 to stack1\n3. Move J from stack4 to stack2\n4. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n5. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n6. Move G from stack3 to stack1\n7. Move F from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n8. Move B from stack1 to stack3\n9. Move H from stack1 to stack3\n10. Move I from stack2 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 4 to 2\nMove A from 4 to 1\nMove J from 4 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\n>>>"
