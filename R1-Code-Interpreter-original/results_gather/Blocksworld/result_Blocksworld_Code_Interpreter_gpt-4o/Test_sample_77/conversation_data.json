    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan the moves while adhering to the rule of only moving the top block from each stack. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: C B\n- stack2: D H E\n- stack3: F A\n- stack4: G\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A B C E H\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: F G\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move F from stack3 to stack4\n3. Move G from stack4 to stack3\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack1\n5. Move H from stack2 to stack1\n6. Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n7. Move C from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n8. Move B from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack4\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
