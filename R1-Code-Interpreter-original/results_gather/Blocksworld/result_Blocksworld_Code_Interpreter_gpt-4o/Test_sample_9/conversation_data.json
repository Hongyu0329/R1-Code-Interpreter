    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: E B I\n- stack3: F D\n- stack4: C H G A\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: A B D H\n- stack2: I\n- stack3: C E F G\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move A from stack4 to stack1\n2. Move G from stack4 to stack3\n3. Move H from stack4 to stack1\n4. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n5. Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no change, just to free up D)\n6. Move C from stack4 to stack3\n7. Move E from stack2 to stack3\n8. Move B from stack2 to stack1\n9. Move I from stack2 to stack2 (no change, just to free up B)\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove A from stack4 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove H from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack3\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack2 to stack2\n>>>\n```"
