    "\nassistant > To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks one at a time from the initial state to the goal state, following the rules provided. Let's determine the sequence of moves required:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: G B D\n- stack3: A I C E H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: E G H\n- stack2: A D I\n- stack3: B C F\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n1. Move H from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n3. Move C from stack3 to stack3\n4. Move I from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move A from stack3 to stack2\n6. Move B from stack2 to stack3\n7. Move D from stack2 to stack2\n8. Move G from stack2 to stack1\n9. Move F from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 3\nMove I from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 2\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 3\n>>>"
