    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: H J A B\n- stack2: F I K C\n- stack3: \n- stack4: G E D\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B C D E I K\n- stack2: A H J\n- stack3: F G\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move B from stack1 to stack3\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack2\n3. Move J from stack1 to stack2\n4. Move H from stack1 to stack2\n5. Move C from stack2 to stack1\n6. Move K from stack2 to stack1\n7. Move I from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n9. Move D from stack4 to stack1\n10. Move E from stack4 to stack1\n11. Move G from stack4 to stack3\n12. Move H from stack2 to stack1\n13. Move J from stack2 to stack1\n14. Move A from stack2 to stack1\n\nNow, let's write these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove J from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove K from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\nMove J from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
