    "\nassistant > To achieve the goal state from the initial state, we need to carefully plan a series of moves. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: G F B\n- stack4: A H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B C D E F G H\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n\nLet's perform the moves:\n\n1. Move H from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move A from stack4 to stack3\n3. Move B from stack3 to stack1\n4. Move F from stack3 to stack1\n5. Move G from stack3 to stack1\n6. Move D from stack2 to stack1\n7. Move H from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move C from stack1 to stack3\n9. Move E from stack1 to stack3\n10. Move H from stack1 to stack3\n11. Move D from stack1 to stack3\n12. Move G from stack1 to stack3\n13. Move F from stack1 to stack3\n14. Move E from stack3 to stack1\n15. Move D from stack3 to stack1\n16. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n17.
