    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at any time. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: \n- stack2: B\n- stack3: C A E D\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A B E\n\nWe need to move the blocks in a sequence that respects the constraints and achieves the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to match the goal state for stack1).\n2. Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to free up A and B for their final positions).\n3. Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no actual move needed, but A is now the top block).\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to match the goal state for stack3).\n5. Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to match the goal state for stack2).\n6. Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to match the goal state for stack3).\n\nNow, let's write down the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 2 to 3\n>>>"
