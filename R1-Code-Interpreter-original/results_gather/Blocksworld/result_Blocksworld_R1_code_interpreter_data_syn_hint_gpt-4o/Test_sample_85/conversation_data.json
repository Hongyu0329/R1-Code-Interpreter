    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D C E\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: \n- stack4: B\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C D\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: E\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. **Move E from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up C and D to be moved.\n2. **Move C from stack1 to stack3**: This allows D to be moved to its final position.\n3. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: This clears stack1 for A.\n4. **Move A from stack2 to stack1**: A is now in its final position.\n5. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: D is now in its final position.\n6. **Move C from stack3 to stack1**: C is now in its final position.\n7. **Move B from stack4 to stack2**: B is now in its final position.\n8. **Move E from stack3 to stack3**: E is already in its final position, so no move is needed.\n\nNow, let's format these moves according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove B from 4 to 2\n>>>"
