    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: G B D\n- stack3: A I C E H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: E G H\n- stack2: A D I\n- stack3: B C F\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move H from stack3 to stack1**: This is because H needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n2. **Move E from stack3 to stack1**: E also needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n3. **Move C from stack3 to stack3**: C needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n4. **Move I from stack3 to stack2**: I needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n5. **Move A from stack3 to stack2**: A needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n6. **Move D from stack2 to stack2**: D is already in the correct stack but needs to be below A and I.\n7. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: B needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n8. **Move G from stack2 to stack1**: G needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n9. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: F needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n\nNow, let's write down the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove I from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
