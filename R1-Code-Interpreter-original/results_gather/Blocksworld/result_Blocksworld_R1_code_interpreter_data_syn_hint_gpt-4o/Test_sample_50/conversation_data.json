    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D E H G\n   - stack2: A F I\n   - stack3: B C\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: G I\n   - stack2: A C D F H\n   - stack3: B E\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. We can only move the top block from each stack.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to free up H).\n   - Move H from stack1 to stack2 (to free up E).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 (to free up D).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to clear stack1 for the goal state).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state in stack1).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to form the goal state in stack2).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal state in stack1).\n\nLet's execute these moves in the correct order:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['D', 'E', 'H', 'G'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'F', 'I'],\n    'stack3': ['B', 'C']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['G', 'I'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'H'],\n    'stack3': ['B', 'E']\n}\n\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    ('G', 'stack1', 'stack3'),\n    ('H', 'stack1', 'stack2'),\n    ('E', 'stack1', 'stack3'),\n    ('D', 'stack1', 'stack2'),\n    ('I', 'stack2', 'stack1'),\n    ('C', 'stack3', 'stack2'),\n    ('G', 'stack3', 'stack1')\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(f\"Move {move[0]} from {move[1]} to {move[2]}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the series of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
    "The code execution result shows the moves, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the sequence or the logic of the moves.
