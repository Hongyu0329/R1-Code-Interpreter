    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E A B C\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: D F\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A C E\n   - stack2: B F\n   - stack3: D\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block of any stack.\n\n4. **Steps to Achieve the Goal:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to free up B).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 (to free up A).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3 (to free up E).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to form the goal stack1).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to form the goal stack2).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack2 (to complete the goal stack2).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\nLet's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack3\n>>>"
