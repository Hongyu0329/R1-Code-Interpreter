    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D A\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: \n   - stack4: E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: A C D E\n   - stack3: B\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move blocks to achieve the goal state by following the rules: only move the top block of any stack, and only use the existing stacks.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack2 (stack2 becomes B C A)\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2 (stack2 becomes B C A D)\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 (stack3 becomes B)\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack2 (stack2 becomes B C A D E)\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n- Move A from stack1 to stack2\n- Move D from stack1 to stack2\n- Move B from stack2 to stack3\n- Move E from stack4 to stack2\n\nThese moves will transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's format the answer:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack4 to stack2\n>>>"
