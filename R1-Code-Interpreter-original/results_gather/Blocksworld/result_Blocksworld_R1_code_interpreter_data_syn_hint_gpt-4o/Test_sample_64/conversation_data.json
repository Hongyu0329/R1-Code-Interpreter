    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G C\n- stack2: D A E B\n- stack3: I H F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B I\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A C D F G H\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: This is because B needs to be at the bottom of stack1 in the goal state.\n2. **Move E from stack2 to stack2**: E is already in the correct stack but needs to be the only block in stack2.\n3. **Move A from stack2 to stack3**: A needs to be in stack3.\n4. **Move D from stack2 to stack3**: D needs to be in stack3.\n5. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: F needs to be in stack3, but we need to clear the way for other blocks first.\n6. **Move H from stack3 to stack2**: H needs to be in stack3, but we need to clear the way for other blocks first.\n7. **Move I from stack3 to stack1**: I needs to be on top of B in stack1.\n8. **Move G from stack1 to stack3**: G needs to be in stack3.\n9. **Move C from stack1 to stack3**: C needs to be in stack3.\n10. **Move H from stack2 to stack3**: H needs to be in stack3.\n11. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: F needs to be in stack3.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
