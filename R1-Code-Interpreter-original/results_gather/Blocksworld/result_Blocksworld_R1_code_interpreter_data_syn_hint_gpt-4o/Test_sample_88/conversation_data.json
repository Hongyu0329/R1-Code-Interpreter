    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we have to carefully plan each move to ensure that we can eventually reach the goal configuration.\n\nLet's break down the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: \n  - stack2: G A E F C B\n  - stack3: D\n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: A D E\n  - stack2: G\n  - stack3: B C F\n\nWe need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n2. Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to clear the way for other moves).\n3. Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to clear the way for other moves).\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to clear the way for other moves).\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n6. Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n7. Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n8. Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n9. Move B from stack3 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 3\n>>>"
