    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: F H\n   - stack2: G D\n   - stack3: E C B\n   - stack4: A I\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D F\n   - stack2: B C E\n   - stack3: A G H I\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack.\n   - We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and gradually build up the stacks to match the goal state.\n\nLet's outline the moves:\n\n- Move H from stack1 to stack3 (to free F for later).\n- Move D from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n- Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to free stack2 for B, C, E).\n- Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal stack2).\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to complete the goal stack2).\n- Move I from stack4 to stack3 (to free A for its goal position).\n- Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n- Move G from stack3 to stack3 (G is already in the correct stack, just needs to be on top of A).\n- Move H from stack3 to stack3 (H is already in the correct stack, just needs to be on top of G).\n- Move I from stack3 to stack3 (I is already in the correct stack, just needs to be on top of H).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove I from 4 to 3\nMove A from 4 to 3\nMove G from 3 to 3\nMove H from 3 to 3\nMove I from 3 to 3\n>>>"
