    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: H D\n- stack2: E J A C F\n- stack3: B I G K\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B E I J K\n- stack2: A C D F\n- stack3: G H\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state after each move to ensure progress towards the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move K from stack3 to stack1\n2. Move G from stack3 to stack3 (no change, just to free up B)\n3. Move B from stack3 to stack1\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n5. Move C from stack2 to stack2 (no change, just to free up A)\n6. Move A from stack2 to stack2 (no change, just to free up J)\n7. Move J from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move I from stack3 to stack1\n9. Move E from stack2 to stack1\n10. Move D from stack1 to stack2\n11. Move H from stack1 to stack3\n\nLet's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove K from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack3\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack2\nMove A from stack2 to stack2\nMove J from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
