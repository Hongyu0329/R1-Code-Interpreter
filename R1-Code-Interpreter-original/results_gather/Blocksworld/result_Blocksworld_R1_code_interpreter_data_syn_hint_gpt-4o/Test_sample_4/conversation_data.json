    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F A G\n- stack2: E B\n- stack3: C D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B D\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: C E F\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - stack1: F A\n   - stack2: E B G\n   - stack3: C D\n\n2. **Move A from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: E B G\n   - stack3: C D A\n\n3. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: E B G\n   - stack3: C D A F\n\n4. **Move A from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: E B G\n   - stack3: C D F\n\n5. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - stack1: A D\n   - stack2: E B G\n   - stack3: C F\n\n6. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - stack1: A D\n   - stack2: E B G F\n   - stack3: C\n\n7. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - stack1: A D B\n   - stack2: E G F\n   - stack3: C\n\n8. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - stack1: A B\n   - stack2: E G F D\n   - stack3: C\n\n9. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - stack1: A B\n   - stack2: G F D\n   - stack3: C E\n\n10. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: \n    - stack1: A B\n    - stack2: G D\n    - stack3: C E F\n\n11. **Move D from stack2 to stack1**: \n    - stack1: A B D\n    - stack2: G\n    - stack3: C E F\n\nNow, the stacks match the goal state. Let's format the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
