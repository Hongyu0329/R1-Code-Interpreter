    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A\n- stack2: E B D F\n- stack3: G C\n- stack4: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D E F\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: B C\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move F from stack2 to stack4**: This frees up D to be moved next.\n2. **Move D from stack2 to stack1**: This starts forming the goal stack1.\n3. **Move E from stack2 to stack1**: Continue forming stack1.\n4. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: This allows C to be moved next.\n5. **Move C from stack3 to stack1**: This frees up G to be moved.\n6. **Move G from stack3 to stack2**: This completes stack2 as per the goal.\n7. **Move B from stack3 to stack3**: This completes stack3 as per the goal.\n8. **Move F from stack4 to stack1**: This completes stack1 as per the goal.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack2 to stack4\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack3\nMove F from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
