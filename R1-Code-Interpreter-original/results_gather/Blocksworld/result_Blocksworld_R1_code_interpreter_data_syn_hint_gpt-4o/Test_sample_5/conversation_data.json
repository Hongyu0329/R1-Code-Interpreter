    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D C F B\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: \n- stack4: G A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B F G\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: A D\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. **Move B from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up F to be moved.\n2. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: This allows us to move C.\n3. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This places C in its goal position.\n4. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: This clears stack1 for the next moves.\n5. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: This places A in its goal position.\n6. **Move G from stack4 to stack1**: This places G in its goal position.\n7. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: This places F in its goal position.\n8. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This places B in its goal position.\n9. **Move D from stack3 to stack3**: This is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n\nNow, let's format these moves according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove G from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
