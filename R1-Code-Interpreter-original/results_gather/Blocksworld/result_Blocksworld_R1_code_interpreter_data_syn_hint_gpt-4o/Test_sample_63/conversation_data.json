    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. The goal is to have all blocks in stack1 in the order B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and stack3 should only have block A. Stack2 should be empty.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that only the top block of each stack is moved at any time.\n3. Follow the constraints and ensure that the final configuration matches the goal state.\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: G F B\n- stack4: A H\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B C D E F G H\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. Move H from stack4 to stack2\n2. Move A from stack4 to stack3\n3. Move H from stack2 to stack3\n4. Move B from stack3 to stack2\n5. Move F from stack3 to stack4\n6. Move G from stack3 to stack4\n7. Move B from stack2 to stack1\n8. Move G from stack4 to stack1\n9. Move F from stack4 to stack1\n10. Move D from stack2 to stack1\n11. Move H from stack3 to stack2\n12. Move A from stack3 to stack2\n13. Move H from stack2 to stack1\n14. Move A from stack2 to stack3\n15. Move E from stack1 to stack2\n16. Move C from stack1 to stack2\n17. Move E from stack2 to stack1\n18. Move C from stack2 to stack1\n\nNow, let's format the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack3 to stack4\nMove G from stack3 to stack4\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
