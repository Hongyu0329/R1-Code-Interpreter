    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: H E D F A\n- stack2: G B\n- stack3: C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: A B D E\n- stack3: C F H\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move A from stack1 to stack2**: This frees up F to be moved.\n2. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up D to be moved.\n3. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: This allows us to start building stack2.\n4. **Move E from stack1 to stack2**: This continues building stack2.\n5. **Move H from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up G to be moved.\n6. **Move G from stack2 to stack1**: This completes stack1 as per the goal state.\n7. **Move B from stack2 to stack2**: This is already in place, no move needed.\n8. **Move C from stack3 to stack3**: This is already in place, no move needed.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 1\n>>>"
