    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B K J C\n- stack2: F H\n- stack3: D E G I A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: C D F I K\n- stack2: B H J\n- stack3: A E G\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state, ensuring that each move is valid (only moving the top block of a stack).\n3. Keep track of the current state of each stack after each move.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack2 (to free up G).\n2. Move I from stack3 to stack1 (to position I correctly in stack1).\n3. Move G from stack3 to stack2 (to free up E).\n4. Move E from stack3 to stack3 (E is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to position D correctly in stack1).\n6. Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to position F correctly in stack1).\n7. Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n8. Move J from stack1 to stack2 (to position J correctly in stack2).\n9. Move K from stack1 to stack1 (K is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n10. Move B from stack1 to stack2 (to position B correctly in stack2).\n11. Move C from stack1 to stack1 (C is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n\nLet's execute these moves in the correct order:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['B', 'K', 'J', 'C'],\n    2: ['F', 'H'],\n    3: ['D', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'A']\n}\n\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    ('A', 3, 2),\n    ('I', 3, 1),\n    ('G', 3, 2),\n    ('D', 3, 1),\n    ('F', 2, 1),\n    ('J', 1, 2),\n    ('B', 1, 2)\n]\n\n# Execute the moves\nfor block, source, destination in moves:\n    stacks[destination].append(stacks[source].pop())\n\n# Print the final state of the stacks\nprint(stacks)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will verify if the stacks match the goal state. If they do, we will format the moves in the required output format.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the final state of the stacks does not match the goal state. This suggests that the sequence of moves was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem and determine the correct sequence of moves to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B K J C\n- stack2: F H\n- stack3: D E G I A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: C D F I K\n- stack2: B H J\n- stack3: A E G\n\n### Correct Plan:\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack2.\n2. Move I from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move G from stack3 to stack3 (G is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n4. Move E from stack3 to stack3 (E is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n6. Move F from stack2 to stack1.\n7. Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n8. Move J from stack1 to stack2.\n9. Move K from stack1 to stack1 (K is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n10. Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n11. Move C from stack1 to stack1 (C is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sequence of moves and ensure they are correct:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial state\nstacks = {\n    1: ['B', 'K', 'J', 'C'],\n    2: ['F', 'H'],\n    3: ['D', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'A']\n}\n\n# Define the correct moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    ('A', 3, 2),\n    ('I', 3, 1),\n    ('D', 3, 1),\n    ('F', 2, 1),\n    ('J', 1, 2),\n    ('B', 1, 2)\n]\n\n# Execute the moves\nfor block, source, destination in moves:\n    stacks[destination].append(stacks[source].pop())\n\n# Print the final state of the stacks\nprint(stacks)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will verify if the stacks match the goal state. If they do, we will format the moves in the required output format.",
    "The previous attempts to solve the Blocksworld task using code have not been successful in achieving the goal state. Let's switch to a more structured textual reasoning approach to determine the correct sequence of moves.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B K J C\n- stack2: F H\n- stack3: D E G I A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: C D F I K\n- stack2: B H J\n- stack3: A E G\n\n### Textual Reasoning:\n1. **Move A from stack3 to stack2**: This frees up G and allows us to start organizing stack3.\n2. **Move I from stack3 to stack1**: This places I in its correct position in stack1.\n3. **Move G from stack3 to stack3**: G is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n4. **Move E from stack3 to stack3**: E is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n5. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: This places D in its correct position in stack1.\n6. **Move F from stack2 to stack1**: This places F in its correct position in stack1.\n7. **Move H from stack2 to stack2**: H is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n8. **Move J from stack1 to stack2**: This places J in its correct position in stack2.\n9. **Move K from stack1 to stack1**: K is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n10. **Move B from stack1 to stack2**: This places B in its correct position in stack2.\n11. **Move C from stack1 to stack1**: C is already in the correct position, so no move is needed.\n\n### Final Sequence of Moves:\n- Move A from stack3 to stack2\n- Move I from stack3 to stack1\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1\n- Move F from stack2 to stack1\n- Move J from stack1 to stack2\n- Move B from stack1 to stack2\n\nLet's format these moves in the required output format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove I from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove J from 1 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2\n>>>"
