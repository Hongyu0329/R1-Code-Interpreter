    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only move blocks between the existing stacks.\n\nLet's break down the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: D\n  - stack2: F A B\n  - stack3: E\n  - stack4: C\n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: \n  - stack2: B C D E\n  - stack3: A F\n\nTo achieve the goal state, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move C from stack4 to stack2.\n3. Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n\nLet's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove C from 4 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\n>>>"
