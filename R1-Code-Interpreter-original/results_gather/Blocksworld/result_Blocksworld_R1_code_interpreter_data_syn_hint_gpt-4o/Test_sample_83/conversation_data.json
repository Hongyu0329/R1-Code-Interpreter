    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: G A E C\n- stack2: H I F\n- stack3: K\n- stack4: J B D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: J\n- stack3: B D E F G H I K\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks from stack1, stack2, and stack4 to stack3 to form the sequence B D E F G H I K.\n2. Move blocks A and C to stack1.\n3. Move block J to stack2.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack3\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack3\n3. Move A from stack1 to stack3\n4. Move G from stack1 to stack3\n5. Move F from stack2 to stack3\n6. Move I from stack2 to stack3\n7. Move H from stack2 to stack3\n8. Move D from stack4 to stack3\n9. Move B from stack4 to stack3\n10. Move J from stack4 to stack2\n11. Move A from stack3 to stack1\n12. Move C from stack3 to stack1\n\nNow, let's format these moves according to the required output format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
