    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. The initial state and goal state are given as follows:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: C F\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: A B E\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: E F\n- stack2: A B C D\n- stack3: \n\nLet's break down the steps needed to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move A from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\n>>>"
