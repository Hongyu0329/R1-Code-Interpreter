    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D G E C\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: F\n- stack4: B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D G\n- stack2: A C\n- stack3: B E F\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This will allow us to place C on top of A in stack2, which is required in the goal state.\n2. **Move E from stack1 to stack3**: This will free up G and allow us to place E in stack3, which is required in the goal state.\n3. **Move B from stack4 to stack3**: This will place B on top of E in stack3, which is required in the goal state.\n4. **Move F from stack3 to stack3**: F is already in stack3, so no move is needed for F.\n\nNow, let's list the moves:\n\n- Move C from stack1 to stack2\n- Move E from stack1 to stack3\n- Move B from stack4 to stack3\n\nThese moves will transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack3\n>>>"
