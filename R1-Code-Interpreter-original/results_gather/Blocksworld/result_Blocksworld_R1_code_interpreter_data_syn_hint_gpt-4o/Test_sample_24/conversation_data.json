    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from each stack, and we must carefully plan each move to avoid blocking necessary future moves.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: I D B\n- stack2: G J A C E\n- stack3: H F\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: E H\n- stack2: A G\n- stack3: B C D F I J\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks from stack1 and stack2 to stack3 to free up space and arrange blocks in the desired order.\n2. Move blocks from stack3 to stack1 and stack2 to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move H from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move J from stack2 to stack3.\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n9. Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n10. Move I from stack1 to stack2.\n11. Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n12. Move A from stack3 to stack2.\n13. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n14. Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n15. Move H from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n16. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n17. Move I from stack2 to stack3.\n18. Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n19. Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's format the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove J from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
