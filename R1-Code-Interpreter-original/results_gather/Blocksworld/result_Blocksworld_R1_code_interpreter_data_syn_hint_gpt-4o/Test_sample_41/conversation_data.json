    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states to determine the sequence of moves.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: I\n- stack2: G C H A E\n- stack3: F B\n- stack4: D K J\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D F I J\n- stack2: G H\n- stack3: B C E K\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This frees up A to be moved to stack1.\n2. **Move A from stack2 to stack1**: A is now in its correct position in stack1.\n3. **Move J from stack4 to stack1**: J is now in its correct position in stack1.\n4. **Move K from stack4 to stack3**: K is now in its correct position in stack3.\n5. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: D is now in its correct position in stack1.\n6. **Move B from stack3 to stack2**: This frees up F to be moved to stack1.\n7. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: F is now in its correct position in stack1.\n8. **Move C from stack2 to stack3**: C is now in its correct position in stack3.\n9. **Move H from stack2 to stack2**: H is already in its correct position in stack2.\n10. **Move G from stack2 to stack2**: G is already in its correct position in stack2.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove J from stack4 to stack1\nMove K from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
