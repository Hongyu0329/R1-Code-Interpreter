    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: C F\n   - stack2: E B G H\n   - stack3: A D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B F\n   - stack2: H\n   - stack3: C D E G\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and are on top of their respective stacks.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed as H is already in the correct position).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed as D is already in the correct position).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack3.\n\nLet's list the moves in the required format:\n\n```\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\n```\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
