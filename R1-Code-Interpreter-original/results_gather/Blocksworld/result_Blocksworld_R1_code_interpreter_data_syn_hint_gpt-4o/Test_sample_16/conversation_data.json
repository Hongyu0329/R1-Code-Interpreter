    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\nInitial State:\n- stack1: C A F\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: D E\n\nGoal State:\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: A C D\n- stack3: E F\n\nWe need to move blocks one at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack is moved. Let's plan the moves:\n\n1. Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to free up A and C for movement).\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state in stack2).\n3. Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal state in stack2).\n4. Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to place B in its final position).\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to complete the goal state in stack2).\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n7. Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
