    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states to determine the sequence of moves required.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: E\n- stack3: B A F J\n- stack4: C G D H I\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: C D\n- stack2: E F I\n- stack3: A B G H J\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move I from stack4 to stack2**: This is because I needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n2. **Move H from stack4 to stack3**: H needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n3. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: D needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n4. **Move G from stack4 to stack3**: G needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n5. **Move C from stack4 to stack1**: C needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n6. **Move J from stack3 to stack3**: J is already in the correct stack, so no move is needed.\n7. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: F needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n8. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: A is already in the correct stack, so no move is needed.\n9. **Move B from stack3 to stack3**: B is already in the correct stack, so no move is needed.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack4 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove C from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
