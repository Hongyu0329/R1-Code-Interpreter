    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: I J F\n   - stack2: B G E C\n   - stack3: H D A\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B C H I J\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: A E F G\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their correct position in the goal state.\n\n4. **Step-by-step Moves:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (A is already in the correct position).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack1 (J is already in the correct position).\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack1 (I is already in the correct position).\n\nLet's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 3\n>>>"
