    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G A F E C\n- stack2: J H B\n- stack3: I D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A B D F I\n- stack2: C H\n- stack3: E G J\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This frees up E to be moved.\n2. **Move E from stack1 to stack3**: This allows us to move F.\n3. **Move F from stack1 to stack2**: This is a temporary move to free up A.\n4. **Move A from stack1 to stack3**: This is a temporary move to free up G.\n5. **Move G from stack1 to stack3**: This is a temporary move to free up J.\n6. **Move J from stack2 to stack1**: This is a temporary move to free up H.\n7. **Move H from stack2 to stack3**: This is a temporary move to free up B.\n8. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: This is a temporary move to free up F.\n9. **Move F from stack2 to stack1**: This is a temporary move to free up C.\n10. **Move C from stack2 to stack3**: This is a temporary move to free up H.\n11. **Move H from stack3 to stack2**: This is a temporary move to free up G.\n12. **Move G from stack3 to stack2**: This is a temporary move to free up E.\n13. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: This is a temporary move to free up A.\n14. **Move A from stack3 to stack1**: This is a temporary move to free up D.\n15. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: This is a temporary move to free up I.\n16. **Move I from stack3 to stack1**: This completes the goal state for stack1.\n17. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This is a temporary move to free up G.\n18. **Move G from stack2 to stack3**: This is a temporary move to free up J.\n19. **Move J from stack1 to stack3**: This completes the goal state for stack3.\n20. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This completes the goal state for stack2.\n\nNow, let's format these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove J from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove J from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
