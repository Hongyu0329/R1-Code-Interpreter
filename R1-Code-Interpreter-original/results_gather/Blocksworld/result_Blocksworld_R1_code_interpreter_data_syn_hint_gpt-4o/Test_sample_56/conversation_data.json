    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move the blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: B C E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C D E\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: \n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move C from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n4. Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n5. Move C from stack1 to stack3.\n6. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n7. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n8. Move C from stack3 to stack1.\n9. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write down these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
