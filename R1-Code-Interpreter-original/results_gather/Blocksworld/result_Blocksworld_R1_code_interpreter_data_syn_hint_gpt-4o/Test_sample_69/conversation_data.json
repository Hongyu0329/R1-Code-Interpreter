    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states to determine the sequence of moves.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: H I B E A\n- stack2: J\n- stack3: G\n- stack4: F D K C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: H\n- stack2: B C F G I\n- stack3: A D E J K\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move blocks from stack1 to achieve the goal configuration.\n2. Move blocks from stack4 to stack2 and stack3 as needed.\n3. Ensure that stack2 and stack3 are arranged according to the goal state.\n\nLet's start by moving blocks to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Move A from stack1 to stack3\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack3\n3. Move B from stack1 to stack2\n4. Move I from stack1 to stack2\n5. Move H from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n6. Move C from stack4 to stack2\n7. Move K from stack4 to stack3\n8. Move D from stack4 to stack3\n9. Move F from stack4 to stack2\n10. Move G from stack3 to stack2\n11. Move J from stack2 to stack3\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```python\nmoves = [\n    \"Move A from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move E from stack1 to stack3\",\n    \"Move B from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move I from stack1 to stack2\",\n    \"Move C from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move K from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move D from stack4 to stack3\",\n    \"Move F from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move G from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move J from stack2 to stack3\"\n]\n\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The task requires a careful sequence of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state.
