    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: C B\n- stack3: E\n- stack4: A F D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: B D E G\n- stack3: F\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack4 to stack2**: This frees up F to be moved.\n2. **Move F from stack4 to stack3**: This places F in its final position.\n3. **Move A from stack4 to stack1**: This places A in its final position.\n4. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: This places E in its final position.\n5. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: This places G in its final position.\n6. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: This places C in its final position.\n7. **Move B from stack2 to stack2**: This is a redundant move, but it ensures B is in its final position.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 4 to 2\nMove F from 4 to 3\nMove A from 4 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 1\n>>>"
