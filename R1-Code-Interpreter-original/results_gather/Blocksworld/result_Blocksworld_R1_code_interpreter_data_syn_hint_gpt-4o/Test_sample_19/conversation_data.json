    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G F\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A B\n- stack4: D C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D E\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: A C F\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up G to be moved to stack2.\n2. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: This places G in its final position.\n3. **Move E from stack2 to stack1**: This allows us to start building stack1.\n4. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This places B in its final position.\n5. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: This is a placeholder move to maintain the order.\n6. **Move C from stack4 to stack3**: This places C in its final position.\n7. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: This places D in its final position.\n8. **Move F from stack3 to stack3**: This is a placeholder move to maintain the order.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
