    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from the initial state to the goal state by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A G\n- stack2: F E\n- stack3: C\n- stack4: H J I B D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A B\n- stack2: C E G J\n- stack3: D F H I\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack4 to stack3**: This frees up B to be moved next.\n2. **Move B from stack4 to stack1**: This completes stack1 in the goal state.\n3. **Move I from stack4 to stack3**: This allows us to move J next.\n4. **Move J from stack4 to stack2**: This completes the top of stack2 in the goal state.\n5. **Move H from stack4 to stack3**: This allows us to move F next.\n6. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: This completes the top of stack3 in the goal state.\n7. **Move E from stack2 to stack2**: This is already in the correct position.\n8. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: This completes stack2 in the goal state.\n9. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This completes stack2 in the goal state.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove I from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
