    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E D\n   - stack2: A B\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A E\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: C D\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block of any stack. Let's plan the moves:\n\n1. Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to free E and make space for A).\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack4 (to make space for A).\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to place A in its goal position).\n4. Move E from stack4 to stack1 (to place E on top of A).\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack3 (to place D on top of C).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n```plaintext\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack4\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack3\n```\n\nLet's format the answer as required:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack4\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack3\n>>>"
