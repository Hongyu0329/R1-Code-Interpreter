    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We have four stacks to work with, and we can only move the top block from any stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n- stack4: D B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: A\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. Move B from stack4 to stack2.\n2. Move D from stack4 to stack1.\n3. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from 4 to 2\nMove D from 4 to 1\nMove C from 1 to 2\n>>>"
