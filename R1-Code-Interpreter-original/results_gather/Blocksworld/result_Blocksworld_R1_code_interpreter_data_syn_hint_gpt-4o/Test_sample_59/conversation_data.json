    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: C E A\n- stack4: \n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: A F\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. **Move A from stack3 to stack4**: This frees up E to be moved.\n2. **Move E from stack3 to stack1**: This starts forming the goal state for stack1.\n3. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This starts forming the goal state for stack2.\n4. **Move D from stack2 to stack1**: This completes the goal state for stack1.\n5. **Move B from stack2 to stack4**: This frees up stack2 for the next move.\n6. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: This starts forming the goal state for stack3.\n7. **Move B from stack4 to stack2**: This completes the goal state for stack2.\n8. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: This completes the goal state for stack3.\n\nNow, let's format these moves according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 3 to 4\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove D from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 4\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove B from 4 to 2\nMove A from 4 to 3\n>>>"
