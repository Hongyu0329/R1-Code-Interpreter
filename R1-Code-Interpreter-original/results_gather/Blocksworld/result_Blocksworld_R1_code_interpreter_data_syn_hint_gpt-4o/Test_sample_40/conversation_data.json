    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: G I D\n   - stack2: E A K\n   - stack3: C B H J F\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A D F\n   - stack2: B H I J K\n   - stack3: C E G\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and try to place them in their correct position or temporarily move them to another stack to free up the necessary blocks.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to achieve the goal position for F).\n   - Move J from stack3 to stack2 (to achieve the goal position for J).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to achieve the goal position for H).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to achieve the goal position for B).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (C is already in the correct stack, no move needed).\n   - Move K from stack2 to stack2 (K is already in the correct stack, no move needed).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to achieve the goal position for A).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal position for E).\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to achieve the goal position for I).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack1 (D is already in the correct stack, no move needed).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to achieve the goal position for G).\n\nLet's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove J from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
