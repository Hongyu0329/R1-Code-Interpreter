    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks for moving blocks.\n\nLet's break down the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: G D B C\n  - stack2: F A E\n  - stack3: \n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: A B D E G\n  - stack2: C\n  - stack3: F\n\nWe need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. Let's plan the moves:\n\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to free up B).\n2. Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to free up D).\n3. Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to free up G).\n4. Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to free up stack1 for A).\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to free up A).\n6. Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n7. Move E from stack1 to stack2 (to place B on stack1).\n8. Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n9. Move D from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n10. Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n11. Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n12. Move C from stack2 to stack2 (to achieve the goal stack2).\n13. Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal stack3).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack2 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
