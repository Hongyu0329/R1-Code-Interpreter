    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D C\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: A E\n- stack4: F B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A E\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: C F G\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks for the goal state.\n2. Move blocks to their correct positions according to the goal state.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to free D).\n2. Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to position D correctly).\n3. Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to free stack2 for B).\n4. Move B from stack4 to stack2 (to position B correctly).\n5. Move F from stack4 to stack3 (to position F correctly).\n6. Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to position A correctly).\n7. Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to position E correctly).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove F from stack4 to stack3\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
