    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we must ensure that each move is valid according to the rules.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: H G A C\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: F\n- stack4: B D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B E G\n- stack2: C F\n- stack3: D H\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This frees up A to be moved.\n2. **Move A from stack1 to stack3**: This allows us to start building the goal stack1.\n3. **Move G from stack1 to stack4**: This clears the way for B to be moved.\n4. **Move H from stack1 to stack3**: This allows us to move D to its goal position.\n5. **Move D from stack4 to stack3**: This completes stack3 in the goal state.\n6. **Move B from stack4 to stack1**: This starts building the goal stack1.\n7. **Move G from stack4 to stack1**: This continues building the goal stack1.\n8. **Move E from stack2 to stack1**: This completes stack1 in the goal state.\n9. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: This completes stack2 in the goal state.\n10. **Move C from stack2 to stack2**: This completes stack2 in the goal state.\n\nNow, let's write down the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack4\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack2\n>>>"
