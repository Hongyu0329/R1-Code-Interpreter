    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: H C A F\n- stack4: D G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D E G H\n- stack2: B C F\n- stack3: A\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: This frees up A to be moved to stack3.\n2. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: This is already in the correct position.\n3. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This places C in the correct position on stack2.\n4. **Move H from stack3 to stack1**: This places H in the correct position on stack1.\n5. **Move G from stack4 to stack1**: This places G in the correct position on stack1.\n6. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: This places D in the correct position on stack1.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
