    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: J B\n- stack2: F I E\n- stack3: D A C H G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C G H I J\n- stack2: D F\n- stack3: A E\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move G from stack3 to stack1**: This is because G needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n2. **Move H from stack3 to stack1**: H needs to be on stack1 above G.\n3. **Move C from stack3 to stack1**: C needs to be on stack1 above B.\n4. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: A needs to be on stack3.\n5. **Move D from stack3 to stack2**: D needs to be on stack2.\n6. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: E needs to be on stack3 above A.\n7. **Move I from stack2 to stack1**: I needs to be on stack1 above H.\n8. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: F needs to be on stack2 above D.\n9. **Move B from stack1 to stack1**: B needs to be on stack1 at the bottom.\n10. **Move J from stack1 to stack1**: J needs to be on stack1 at the top.\n\nLet's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack1\nMove J from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
