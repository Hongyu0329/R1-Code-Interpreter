    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A\n- stack2: E C\n- stack3: D B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A C\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack2 to stack3**: This frees up E to be moved to its final position.\n2. **Move E from stack2 to stack2**: E is already in its final position, so no move is needed.\n3. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This places B in its final position.\n4. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: This places D in its final position.\n5. **Move A from stack1 to stack3**: This places A in its final position.\n\nNow, let's write down the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
