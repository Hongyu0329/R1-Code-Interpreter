    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: G I F\n- stack3: C B H A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B C E F I\n- stack2: G H\n- stack3: A D\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks strategically to achieve the goal state configuration.\n3. Ensure that each move is valid by only moving the top block of any stack.\n\n### Steps:\n- Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no change, just a placeholder to start the process).\n- Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n- Move C from stack3 to stack1.\n- Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n- Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no change, just a placeholder to maintain order).\n- Move F from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move I from stack2 to stack1.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
