    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: A I G\n- stack3: C B\n- stack4: K F J H\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C D G\n- stack2: E F H I J K\n- stack3: B\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to form the goal stacks.\n2. Carefully move blocks to their respective goal positions, ensuring that only the top block of each stack is moved at any time.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move H from stack4 to stack2 (to free up J).\n2. Move J from stack4 to stack2 (to free up F).\n3. Move F from stack4 to stack2 (to free up K).\n4. Move K from stack4 to stack2 (stack4 is now empty).\n5. Move B from stack3 to stack4 (to free up C).\n6. Move C from stack3 to stack1 (C is now in its goal position).\n7. Move B from stack4 to stack3 (B is now in its goal position).\n8. Move G from stack2 to stack1 (G is now in its goal position).\n9. Move I from stack2 to stack1 (to free up A).\n10. Move A from stack2 to stack1 (A is now in its goal position).\n11. Move I from stack1 to stack2 (I is now in its goal position).\n12. Move D from stack1 to stack2 (D is now in its goal position).\n13. Move E from stack1 to stack2 (E is now in its goal position).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack2\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove F from stack4 to stack2\nMove K from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack4\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack4 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\n>>>"
