    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. The key is to move blocks one at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack is moved. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: A J\n   - stack3: H F C E I\n   - stack4: B G\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: F I\n   - stack2: A B C D G\n   - stack3: E H J\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and gradually build the stacks as required.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming stack1).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack3 (to start forming stack3).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming stack2).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack3 (to complete stack3).\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack3 (to complete stack3).\n   - Move G from stack4 to stack2 (to complete stack2).\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack2 (to complete stack2).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to complete stack2).\n\nLet's execute these moves in sequence:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial and goal states\ninitial_state = {\n    'stack1': ['D'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'J'],\n    'stack3': ['H', 'F', 'C', 'E', 'I'],\n    'stack4': ['B', 'G']\n}\n\ngoal_state = {\n    'stack1': ['F', 'I'],\n    'stack2': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'G'],\n    'stack3': ['E', 'H', 'J']\n}\n\n# Define the moves to reach the goal state\nmoves = [\n    \"Move I from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move E from stack3 to stack3\",\n    \"Move C from stack3 to stack2\",\n    \"Move F from stack3 to stack1\",\n    \"Move H from stack3 to stack3\",\n    \"Move J from stack2 to stack3\",\n    \"Move G from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move B from stack4 to stack2\",\n    \"Move D from stack1 to stack2\"\n]\n\n# Print the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the sequence of moves needed to transform the initial state into the goal state.",
