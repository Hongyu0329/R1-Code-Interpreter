    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Determine the sequence of moves that will transform the initial state into the goal state.\n3. Ensure that each move is valid according to the rules (only moving the top block).\n\nLet's start by analyzing the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: F B I K A\n  - stack2: H D\n  - stack3: J E C G\n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: C G\n  - stack2: A B D E I K\n  - stack3: F H J\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. Move G from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move C from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move J from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n5. Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n6. Move H from stack2 to stack3.\n7. Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n8. Move K from stack1 to stack2.\n9. Move I from stack1 to stack2.\n10. Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n11. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove K from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
