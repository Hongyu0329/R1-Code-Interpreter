    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We have four stacks, and we can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B H G I D\n- stack2: A F\n- stack3: E\n- stack4: J C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: H\n- stack2: A B D G\n- stack3: C E F I J\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks for the goal state.\n2. Move blocks to their respective goal positions.\n\nLet's start by moving blocks to achieve the goal state:\n\n1. Move C from stack4 to stack3 (to free J).\n2. Move J from stack4 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n3. Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n4. Move A from stack2 to stack2 (A is already in the correct position).\n5. Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n6. Move I from stack1 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n7. Move G from stack1 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n8. Move H from stack1 to stack1 (H is already in the correct position).\n9. Move B from stack1 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\n>>>"
