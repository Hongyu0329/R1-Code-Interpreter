    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack, and we must adhere to the constraints of the problem.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: C B\n- stack2: D H E\n- stack3: F A\n- stack4: G\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A B C E H\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: F G\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to achieve the goal state.\n2. Ensure that the blocks are moved in a way that allows the final configuration to be achieved without violating the rules.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n2. Move F from stack3 to stack4 (to free up stack3 for G).\n3. Move G from stack4 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n5. Move H from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n6. Move C from stack1 to stack1 (C is already in stack1, so no move is needed, but it should be in the correct order).\n7. Move B from stack1 to stack1 (B is already in stack1, so no move is needed, but it should be in the correct order).\n8. Move D from stack2 to stack2 (D is already in stack2, so no move is needed).\n\nNow, let's list the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack4\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
