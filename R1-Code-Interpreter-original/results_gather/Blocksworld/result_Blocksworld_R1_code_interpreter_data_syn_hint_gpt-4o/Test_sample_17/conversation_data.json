    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: C F E\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: \n- stack4: A B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: C E F\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: A\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move B from stack4 to stack2**: This will free up A to be moved to stack3.\n2. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: This places A in its final position.\n3. **Move E from stack1 to stack3**: This will allow us to rearrange F and E in stack1.\n4. **Move F from stack1 to stack4**: This will allow us to place E in its correct position in stack1.\n5. **Move E from stack3 to stack1**: This places E in its final position in stack1.\n6. **Move F from stack4 to stack1**: This places F in its final position in stack1.\n\nNow, let's write down the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack4\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
