    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: E D C\n- stack2: F B\n- stack3: A\n- stack4: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: C D\n- stack3: A B F\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n3. Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
