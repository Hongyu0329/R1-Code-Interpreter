    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's break down the steps required to achieve the goal state.\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: J\n- stack2: C K F E B I\n- stack3: G A\n- stack4: H D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: F G H I J\n- stack2: C D E K\n- stack3: A B\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks to be placed in their goal positions.\n2. Carefully place blocks in their goal positions, ensuring that the order is maintained.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack2 (to free up H).\n2. Move H from stack4 to stack1 (H needs to be in stack1).\n3. Move A from stack3 to stack2 (to free up G).\n4. Move G from stack3 to stack1 (G needs to be in stack1).\n5. Move I from stack2 to stack1 (I needs to be in stack1).\n6. Move B from stack2 to stack3 (B needs to be in stack3).\n7. Move E from stack2 to stack2 (E is already in the correct stack but needs to be below D).\n8. Move F from stack2 to stack1 (F needs to be in stack1).\n9. Move K from stack2 to stack2 (K is already in the correct stack but needs to be below E).\n10. Move C from stack2 to stack2 (C is already in the correct stack but needs to be below K).\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 4 to 2\nMove H from 4 to 1\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove I from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove K from 2 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 2\n>>>"
