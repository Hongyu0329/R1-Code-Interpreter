    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: K D I G B J\n- stack3: H C E A F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A E F\n- stack2: B G K\n- stack3: C D H I J\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Identify the top blocks in each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks to their respective goal positions, ensuring that only the top block is moved at any time.\n3. Repeat the process until the goal state is achieved.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal state for stack1).\n2. Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal state for stack1).\n3. Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal state for stack1).\n4. Move J from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal state for stack3).\n5. Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal state for stack2).\n6. Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal state for stack2).\n7. Move I from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal state for stack3).\n8. Move D from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal state for stack3).\n9. Move C from stack3 to stack3 (to form part of the goal state for stack3).\n10. Move H from stack3 to stack3 (to form part of the goal state for stack3).\n11. Move K from stack2 to stack2 (to form part of the goal state for stack2).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove J from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 3\nMove H from 3 to 3\nMove K from 2 to 2\n>>>"
