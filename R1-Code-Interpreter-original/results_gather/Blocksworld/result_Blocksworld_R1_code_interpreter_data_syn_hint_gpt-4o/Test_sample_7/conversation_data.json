    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only move blocks between the existing stacks.\n\nLet's break down the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: C\n  - stack2: G A B F\n  - stack3: D H\n  - stack4: E\n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: A E\n  - stack2: C D\n  - stack3: B F G H\n\nTo achieve the goal state, we need to perform a series of moves. Let's plan these moves step by step:\n\n1. Move E from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state of stack1).\n2. Move H from stack3 to stack4 (to free up D for moving to stack2).\n3. Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state of stack2).\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to free up B for moving to stack3).\n5. Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to start forming the goal state of stack3).\n6. Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal state of stack1).\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to complete the goal state of stack3).\n8. Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to complete the goal state of stack2).\n\nNow, let's write down these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 4 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 4\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\n>>>"
