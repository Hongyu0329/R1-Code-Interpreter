    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules of only moving the top block from any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: B I\n   - stack2: G F\n   - stack3: C D E\n   - stack4: A H\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: A D\n   - stack3: B C F G H I\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and gradually build the stacks to match the goal state.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to match the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to start building stack2 as per the goal state).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (C is already in stack3, but we need to clear the way for B).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to start building stack3 as per the goal state).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to continue building stack3).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to continue building stack3).\n   - Move H from stack4 to stack3 (to continue building stack3).\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack2 (to complete stack2 as per the goal state).\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack3 (to complete stack3 as per the goal state).\n\nLet's list these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove A from stack4 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
