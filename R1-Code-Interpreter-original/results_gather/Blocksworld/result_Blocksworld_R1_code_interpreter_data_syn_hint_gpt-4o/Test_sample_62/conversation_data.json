    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: G A F E\n- stack3: D C H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: C G\n- stack3: A D E F H\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move H from stack3 to stack1**: This frees up C to be moved to stack2.\n2. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This places C in its correct position in stack2.\n3. **Move D from stack3 to stack3**: D is already in the correct stack but needs to be moved to the top of stack3.\n4. **Move A from stack2 to stack3**: This places A in its correct position in stack3.\n5. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This places E in its correct position in stack3.\n6. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: This places F in its correct position in stack3.\n7. **Move G from stack2 to stack2**: G is already in the correct stack but needs to be moved to the top of stack2.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack2\n>>>"
