    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: B A C\n- stack3: E D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B E\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A D\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: This will free up A to be moved.\n2. **Move A from stack2 to stack3**: This will allow us to move B to its goal position.\n3. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: Now B is in its goal position.\n4. **Move D from stack3 to stack2**: This will allow us to move E to its goal position.\n5. **Move E from stack3 to stack1**: Now E is in its goal position.\n6. **Move D from stack2 to stack3**: Now D is in its goal position.\n7. **Move A from stack3 to stack2**: Now A is in its goal position.\n\nLet's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove A from 3 to 2\n>>>"
