    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: J\n- stack2: D H F I B A G\n- stack3: E C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: G I\n- stack2: A B C D E F H\n- stack3: J\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move G to stack1**: \n   - Move G from stack2 to stack1.\n\n2. **Move A to stack3**:\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n\n3. **Move B to stack3**:\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n\n4. **Move C to stack2**:\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n\n5. **Move E to stack2**:\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n\n6. **Move J to stack3**:\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack3.\n\n7. **Move I to stack1**:\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack1.\n\n8. **Move F to stack2**:\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack2 (no actual move needed, but for clarity).\n\n9. **Move H to stack2**:\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (no actual move needed, but for clarity).\n\n10. **Move D to stack2**:\n    - Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no actual move needed, but for clarity).\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove J from 1 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 1\n>>>"
