    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks.\n\nLet's break down the initial and goal states:\n\n- Initial State:\n  - stack1: D\n  - stack2: E A\n  - stack3: C B\n  - stack4: \n\n- Goal State:\n  - stack1: A C\n  - stack2: B D E\n  - stack3: \n\nTo achieve the goal state, we need to perform a series of moves. Let's plan these moves step by step:\n\n1. Move A from stack2 to stack4 (to free E).\n2. Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to free stack2 for B).\n3. Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n4. Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n5. Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal stack2).\n6. Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to complete the goal stack2).\n7. Move A from stack4 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n\nNow, let's write down these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 2 to 4\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 4 to 1\n>>>"
