    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. The key is to move blocks one at a time, ensuring that each move is valid by only moving the top block of any stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Analyze the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: D I\n     - stack2: H A C\n     - stack3: F B E\n     - stack4: G\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: A B C D F\n     - stack2: E H I\n     - stack3: G\n\n2. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the order in the goal state. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their final position and are on top of other blocks that need to be moved.\n\n3. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to free D).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to free stack1 for A).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack3 (to free stack2 for E).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to complete the goal stack2).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack2 (to complete the goal stack2).\n\nLet's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove I from stack2 to stack2\n>>>"
