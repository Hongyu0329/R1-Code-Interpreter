    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: C D B\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: F A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C F\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: D E\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. **Move A from stack3 to stack1**: This is because A needs to be at the bottom of stack1 in the goal state.\n2. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: F needs to be on top of C in stack1.\n3. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: E needs to be on top of D in stack3.\n4. **Move B from stack1 to stack2**: B needs to be in stack2.\n5. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: D needs to be at the bottom of stack3.\n6. **Move C from stack1 to stack3**: C needs to be on top of A in stack1.\n7. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: F needs to be on top of C in stack1.\n8. **Move C from stack3 to stack1**: C needs to be on top of A in stack1.\n9. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: F needs to be on top of C in stack1.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
