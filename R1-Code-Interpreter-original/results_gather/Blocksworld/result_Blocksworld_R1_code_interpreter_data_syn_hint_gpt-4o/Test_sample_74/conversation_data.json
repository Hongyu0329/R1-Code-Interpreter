    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: B G F\n   - stack2: A E C\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D F G\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: A B C\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. \n   - We can only move the top block from each stack.\n   - We need to ensure that we don't block any necessary moves by placing blocks in the wrong order.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to get D at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to start forming stack3 as A B C).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack2 (E is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3 (to continue forming stack3 as A B C).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to complete stack3 as A B C).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack1 (F is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack1 (G is already in the correct position, so no move needed).\n\nLet's list the necessary moves:\n\n- Move D from stack3 to stack1\n- Move C from stack2 to stack3\n- Move A from stack2 to stack3\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3\n\nNow, let's format the answer according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 1 to 3\n>>>"
