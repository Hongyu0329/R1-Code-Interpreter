    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: F A\n- stack2: K D E B I C\n- stack3: H J G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: A C E F H I J K\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. Move G from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move J from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move I from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n7. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n9. Move K from stack2 to stack3.\n10. Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n11. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n```plaintext\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove J from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove K from 2 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\n```\n\nLet's format the answer as required:\n\n<<<\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove J from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove K from 2 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\n>>>"
