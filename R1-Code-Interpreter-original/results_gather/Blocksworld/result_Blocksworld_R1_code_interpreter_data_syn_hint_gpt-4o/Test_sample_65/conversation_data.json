    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at any time. Let's analyze the initial and goal states to determine the sequence of moves.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B G I\n- stack2: F H D\n- stack3: E C\n- stack4: A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D E I\n- stack2: F G H\n- stack3: A C\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: This is necessary because A needs to be in stack3 in the goal state.\n2. **Move D from stack2 to stack1**: D needs to be in stack1 in the goal state.\n3. **Move C from stack3 to stack3**: C is already in stack3, but it needs to be on top of A, so we need to move it temporarily.\n4. **Move E from stack3 to stack1**: E needs to be in stack1 in the goal state.\n5. **Move C from stack3 to stack3**: Now, we can move C back to stack3 on top of A.\n6. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: G needs to be in stack2 in the goal state.\n7. **Move H from stack2 to stack2**: H is already in stack2, but it needs to be on top of G, so we need to move it temporarily.\n8. **Move I from stack1 to stack1**: I is already in stack1, but it needs to be on top of E, so we need to move it temporarily.\n9. **Move H from stack2 to stack2**: Now, we can move H back to stack2 on top of G.\n10. **Move I from stack1 to stack1**: Finally, move I back to stack1 on top of E.\n\nLet's list these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack2 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
