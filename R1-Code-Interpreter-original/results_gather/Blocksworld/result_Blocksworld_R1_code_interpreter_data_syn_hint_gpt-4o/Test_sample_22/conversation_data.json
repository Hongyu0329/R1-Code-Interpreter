    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: I A G\n   - stack2: D F E\n   - stack3: H B C\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B C H\n   - stack2: F G I\n   - stack3: A D E\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We will start by moving blocks to free up the necessary blocks and then place them in the correct order in the goal stacks.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack2\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3\n\nLet's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 2\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove I from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 3\n>>>"
