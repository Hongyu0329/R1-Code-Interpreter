    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move the blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of each stack can be moved, and we can only use the existing stacks.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E B\n   - stack2: A D C\n   - stack3: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: A B C D E\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n- We need to move all blocks to stack3 in the order A, B, C, D, E.\n- We can only move the top block from each stack.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n2. Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n4. Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n5. Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n- Move C from stack2 to stack3\n- Move D from stack2 to stack3\n- Move A from stack2 to stack3\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3\n- Move E from stack1 to stack3\n\nThis sequence of moves will achieve the goal state. Let's format the answer as required:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
