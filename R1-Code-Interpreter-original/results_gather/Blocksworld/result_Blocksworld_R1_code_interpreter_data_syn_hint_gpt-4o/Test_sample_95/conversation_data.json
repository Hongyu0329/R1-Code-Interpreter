    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: J C\n- stack2: \n- stack3: H G A E D\n- stack4: F B I\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B H\n- stack2: A D E F G I\n- stack3: C J\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move blocks to free up the necessary blocks for the goal state.\n2. Move blocks to their respective goal positions.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Move I from stack4 to stack2 (to free B).\n2. Move B from stack4 to stack1 (goal position).\n3. Move F from stack4 to stack2 (to free stack4).\n4. Move D from stack3 to stack2 (goal position).\n5. Move E from stack3 to stack2 (goal position).\n6. Move A from stack3 to stack2 (goal position).\n7. Move G from stack3 to stack2 (goal position).\n8. Move H from stack3 to stack1 (goal position).\n9. Move C from stack1 to stack3 (goal position).\n10. Move J from stack1 to stack3 (goal position).\n\nLet's list these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove J from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
