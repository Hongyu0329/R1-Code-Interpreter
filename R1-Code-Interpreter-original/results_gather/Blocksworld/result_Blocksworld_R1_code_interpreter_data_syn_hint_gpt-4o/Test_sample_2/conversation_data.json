    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only use the three existing stacks.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: E B F D\n- stack3: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: F\n- stack3: A C D E\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n2. Move F from stack2 to stack2.\n3. Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move C from stack1 to stack3.\n6. Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n- Move D from stack2 to stack3\n- Move F from stack2 to stack2\n- Move B from stack2 to stack1\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3\n- Move C from stack1 to stack3\n- Move A from stack1 to stack3\n\nThis sequence of moves will transform the initial state into the goal state.\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
