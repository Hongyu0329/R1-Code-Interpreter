    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: E D B H F\n- stack3: G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A G H\n- stack2: F\n- stack3: B C D E\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: This is a placeholder move to start the process.\n2. **Move H from stack2 to stack1**: To start forming the goal state in stack1.\n3. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: To clear the path for other blocks.\n4. **Move D from stack2 to stack3**: To continue clearing stack2.\n5. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: To complete the clearing of stack2.\n6. **Move G from stack3 to stack1**: To place G in its goal position.\n7. **Move C from stack1 to stack3**: To clear stack1 for the final arrangement.\n8. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: This is a placeholder move to maintain the sequence.\n9. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: Another placeholder move.\n10. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: Final placeholder move.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence of moves:\n\n```plaintext\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\n```\n\nNow, let's format the answer as required:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
