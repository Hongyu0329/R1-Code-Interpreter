    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: F A C\n- stack3: B D E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D G\n- stack2: \n- stack3: B C E F\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack2 to stack3**: This frees up A to be moved to stack1.\n2. **Move A from stack2 to stack1**: This starts building the goal stack1.\n3. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: This clears stack2.\n4. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: This allows D to be moved to stack1.\n5. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: This continues building the goal stack1.\n6. **Move B from stack3 to stack2**: This prepares stack3 for the final configuration.\n7. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This continues building the goal stack3.\n8. **Move F from stack3 to stack3**: This completes the goal stack3.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack3 to stack3\n>>>"
