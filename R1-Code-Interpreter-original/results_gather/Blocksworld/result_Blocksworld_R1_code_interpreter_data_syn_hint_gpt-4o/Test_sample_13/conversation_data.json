    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: K I G\n- stack2: A F B\n- stack3: J E\n- stack4: C H D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B E F H\n- stack2: A D I\n- stack3: C G J K\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack4 to stack2**: This frees up H to be moved.\n2. **Move H from stack4 to stack1**: This is the correct position for H in the goal state.\n3. **Move C from stack4 to stack3**: This is the correct position for C in the goal state.\n4. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: This is the correct position for B in the goal state.\n5. **Move F from stack2 to stack1**: This is the correct position for F in the goal state.\n6. **Move E from stack3 to stack1**: This is the correct position for E in the goal state.\n7. **Move A from stack2 to stack2**: A is already in the correct stack, but we need to move it to access D.\n8. **Move D from stack2 to stack2**: D is already in the correct stack, but we need to move it to access I.\n9. **Move I from stack1 to stack2**: This is the correct position for I in the goal state.\n10. **Move D from stack2 to stack2**: D is already in the correct stack, but we need to move it to access A.\n11. **Move A from stack2 to stack2**: A is already in the correct stack.\n12. **Move G from stack1 to stack3**: This is the correct position for G in the goal state.\n13. **Move J from stack3 to stack3**: J is already in the correct stack.\n14. **Move K from stack1 to stack3**: This is the correct position for K in the goal state.\n\nNow, let's format these moves according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack4 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack1\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack2\nMove A from stack2 to stack2\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove J from stack3 to stack3\nMove K from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
