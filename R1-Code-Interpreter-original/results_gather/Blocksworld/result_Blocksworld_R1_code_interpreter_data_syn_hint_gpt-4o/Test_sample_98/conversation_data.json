    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rule that only the top block of any stack can be moved at any time. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: A E\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: C B\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B E\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: D\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal state:**\n\n- We need to move B from stack3 to stack1 to achieve the order A B E in stack1.\n- We need to move C from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the order C in stack2.\n- Finally, we need to move D from stack2 to stack3 to achieve the order D in stack3.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n\nLet's write down the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
