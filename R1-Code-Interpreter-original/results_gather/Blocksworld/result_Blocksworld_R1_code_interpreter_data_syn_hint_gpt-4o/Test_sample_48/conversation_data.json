    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: B G\n   - stack2: F E A C\n   - stack3: H D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B F\n   - stack2: D E\n   - stack3: C G H\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and work towards building the goal stacks.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to free up H for its final position).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack3 (H is already in its final position, but we need to clear stack3 for other moves).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (C needs to be at the bottom of stack3).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (A needs to be at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack2 (E is already in its final position, but we need to clear stack2 for other moves).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1 (F needs to be on top of B in stack1).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 (G needs to be in stack3).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack1 (B is already in its final position, but we need to clear stack1 for other moves).\n\nLet's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
