    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: D A E C\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: A B D\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This is because C needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n2. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: E also needs to be on stack2, above C.\n3. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: A is already in the correct stack but needs to be on top of D and B.\n4. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: B needs to be on stack3, above D.\n5. **Move D from stack3 to stack3**: D is already in the correct stack but needs to be at the bottom of stack3.\n\nLet's execute these steps in the correct order:\n\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2\n- Move B from stack2 to stack3\n- Move D from stack3 to stack3\n- Move A from stack3 to stack3\n\nNow, let's format these moves according to the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 3\nMove A from 3 to 3\n>>>"
