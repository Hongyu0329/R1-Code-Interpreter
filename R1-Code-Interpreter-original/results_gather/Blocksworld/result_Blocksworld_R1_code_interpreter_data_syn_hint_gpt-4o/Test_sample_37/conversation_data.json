    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's analyze the initial and goal states to determine the sequence of moves.\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A E F\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: D H G\n- stack4: I\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C D E\n- stack2: A F G H\n- stack3: I\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move F from stack1 to stack2**: This frees up E to be moved.\n2. **Move E from stack1 to stack3**: This allows us to start building the goal stack1.\n3. **Move A from stack1 to stack2**: This clears stack1 for the goal configuration.\n4. **Move G from stack3 to stack2**: This allows us to move D next.\n5. **Move H from stack3 to stack2**: This clears the way for D.\n6. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: This starts building the goal stack1.\n7. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: This continues building the goal stack1.\n8. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: This completes the goal stack1.\n9. **Move A from stack2 to stack2**: This is already in place.\n10. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: This is already in place.\n11. **Move G from stack2 to stack2**: This is already in place.\n12. **Move H from stack2 to stack2**: This is already in place.\n13. **Move I from stack4 to stack3**: This completes the goal stack3.\n\nNow, let's format the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove I from 4 to 3\n>>>"
