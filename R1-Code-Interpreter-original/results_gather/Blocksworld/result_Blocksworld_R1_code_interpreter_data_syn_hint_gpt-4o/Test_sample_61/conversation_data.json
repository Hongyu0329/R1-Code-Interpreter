    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration by following the rules: only the top block of any stack can be moved, and we can only move blocks between the existing stacks.\n\nLet's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: B\n- stack3: G D F A C\n- stack4: E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A B D F\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: G\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n2. Move A from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n4. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n5. Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move E from stack4 to stack2.\n7. Move G from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, G is already in place).\n\nNow, let's write down the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove E from 4 to 2\n>>>"
