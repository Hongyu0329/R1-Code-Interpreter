    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the initial and goal states:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D E G\n- stack2: C B A\n- stack3: F H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B E G\n- stack2: C D H\n- stack3: A F\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move A from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - This will free up B to be moved to stack1.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: D E G\n     - stack2: C B\n     - stack3: F H A\n\n2. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - This places B in its correct position in stack1.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: D E G B\n     - stack2: C\n     - stack3: F H A\n\n3. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - This will allow us to move E to its correct position.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E G B\n     - stack2: C D\n     - stack3: F H A\n\n4. **Move H from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - This places H in its correct position in stack2.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E G B\n     - stack2: C D H\n     - stack3: F A\n\n5. **Move G from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - This will allow us to move E to its correct position.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E B\n     - stack2: C D H\n     - stack3: F A G\n\n6. **Move E from stack1 to stack1**: \n   - E is already in its correct position, so no move is needed.\n\n7. **Move B from stack1 to stack1**: \n   - B is already in its correct position, so no move is needed.\n\n8. **Move F from stack3 to stack3**: \n   - F is already in its correct position, so no move is needed.\n\n9. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: \n   - A is already in its correct position, so no move is needed.\n\nNow, let's compile these moves into the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
