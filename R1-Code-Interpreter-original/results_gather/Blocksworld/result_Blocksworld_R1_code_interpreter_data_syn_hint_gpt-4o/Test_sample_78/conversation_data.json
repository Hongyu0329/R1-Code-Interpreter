    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: F I H\n- stack2: G A E C B\n- stack3: D\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: E F G\n- stack3: B D H I\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Identify the top blocks of each stack that can be moved.\n2. Move blocks to their respective goal positions, ensuring that each move is valid (i.e., only the top block of a stack can be moved).\n3. Repeat the process until the goal state is achieved.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to free up stack3 for B).\n2. Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to place B in its goal position).\n3. Move C from stack2 to stack1 (to place C in its goal position).\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to free up space for F and G).\n5. Move F from stack1 to stack2 (to place F in its goal position).\n6. Move G from stack2 to stack2 (G is already in the correct stack, but we need to ensure the order).\n7. Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to place A in its goal position).\n8. Move H from stack1 to stack3 (to place H in its goal position).\n9. Move I from stack1 to stack3 (to place I in its goal position).\n\nLet's list these moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove G from 2 to 2\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove H from 1 to 3\nMove I from 1 to 3\n>>>"
