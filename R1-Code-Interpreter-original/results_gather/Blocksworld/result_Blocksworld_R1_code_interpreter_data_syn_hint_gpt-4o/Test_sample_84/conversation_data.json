    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E C\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: A B\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: A C E\n   - stack3: D\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal state:**\n\n- We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration. We can only move the top block from each stack.\n\n- **Step-by-step moves:**\n\n  1. Move B from stack3 to stack1 (stack3: A, stack1: E C B)\n  2. Move A from stack3 to stack2 (stack3: empty, stack2: D A)\n  3. Move B from stack1 to stack3 (stack1: E C, stack3: B)\n  4. Move C from stack1 to stack2 (stack1: E, stack2: D A C)\n  5. Move E from stack1 to stack2 (stack1: empty, stack2: D A C E)\n  6. Move B from stack3 to stack1 (stack3: empty, stack1: B)\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
