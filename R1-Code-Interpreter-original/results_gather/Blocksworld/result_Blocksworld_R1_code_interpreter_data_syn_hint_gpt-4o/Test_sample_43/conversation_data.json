    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks according to the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D B\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: C\n- stack4: A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A B\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Goal State:\n\n1. **Move B from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - This frees up D to be moved and places B in a position where it can eventually be moved to stack3.\n\n2. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - This allows E to be moved to stack1, achieving part of the goal state.\n\n3. **Move E from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - Now stack1 matches the goal state with D E.\n\n4. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - This places C in the correct position for the goal state.\n\n5. **Move B from stack3 to stack3**: \n   - Finally, move B to stack3 to complete the goal state.\n\nNow, let's write down the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack3\n>>>"
