    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: B E\n- stack3: F C G A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: B F G\n- stack2: A C D\n- stack3: E\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move A from stack3 to stack2**: This will allow us to access the blocks below A in stack3.\n2. **Move G from stack3 to stack1**: This is part of the goal state for stack1.\n3. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This will help in forming the goal state for stack2.\n4. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: This is part of the goal state for stack1.\n5. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This will help in forming the goal state for stack3.\n6. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: This completes the goal state for stack1.\n7. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: This completes the goal state for stack2.\n\nLet's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 2\n>>>"
