    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: \n     - stack2: E B I\n     - stack3: F D\n     - stack4: C H G A\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: A B D H\n     - stack2: I\n     - stack3: C E F G\n\n2. **Identify the Top Blocks:**\n   - stack1: (empty)\n   - stack2: I\n   - stack3: D\n   - stack4: A\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block of each stack.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move G from stack4 to stack3 (to clear the way for H).\n   - Move H from stack4 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move C from stack4 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no change, but to clear the way for E).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack2 (no change, but to ensure stack2 is correct).\n\n5. **Verify the Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B D H\n   - stack2: I\n   - stack3: C E F G\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 4 to 1\nMove G from 4 to 3\nMove H from 4 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove I from 2 to 2\n>>>"
