    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: C F E\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: \n- stack4: A B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: C E F\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: A\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: (empty)\n   - stack4: B\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - C should remain in stack1.\n   - E should be on top of C in stack1.\n   - F should be on top of E in stack1.\n   - B should be on top of D in stack2.\n   - D should remain in stack2.\n   - A should be in stack3.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack2 (to be on top of D).\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to achieve its final position).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 (temporarily to free F).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack1 (to be on top of E eventually).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to be on top of C).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack1 (to be on top of E).\n\n**Execute the moves:**\n\n- Move B from stack4 to stack2\n- Move A from stack4 to stack3\n- Move E from stack1 to stack3\n- Move F from stack1 to stack1\n- Move E from stack3 to stack1\n- Move F from stack1 to stack1\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
