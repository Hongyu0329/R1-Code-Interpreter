    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B C\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: F D E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: F\n- stack3: B D E\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the differences between the initial and goal states:**\n   - In stack1, B needs to be moved out and A needs to be placed at the bottom.\n   - In stack2, A needs to be moved to stack1, and F needs to be moved to stack2.\n   - In stack3, B needs to be moved to stack3.\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 to free up space for A in stack1.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 to achieve the goal configuration for stack1.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 to achieve the goal configuration for stack2.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
