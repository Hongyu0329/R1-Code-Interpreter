    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: B A C\n- stack3: E D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B E\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A D\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: (empty)\n   - stack2: C (top)\n   - stack3: D (top)\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. \n   - The goal is to have B and E on stack1, C on stack2, and A and D on stack3.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 (to clear the way for A and B).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3 (to position A correctly).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to position B correctly).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to position C correctly).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to clear the way for E).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to position E correctly).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3 (to position D correctly).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove D from 2 to 3\n>>>"
