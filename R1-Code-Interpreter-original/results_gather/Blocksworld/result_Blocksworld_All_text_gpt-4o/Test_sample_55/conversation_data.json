    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: J\n- stack2: C K F E B I\n- stack3: G A\n- stack4: H D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: F G H I J\n- stack2: C D E K\n- stack3: A B\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. We need to move blocks to achieve the desired order in each stack.\n2. We can only move the top block from any stack.\n3. We need to ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards achieving the goal state.\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. Move D from stack4 to stack2 (to free H for later moves).\n2. Move H from stack4 to stack1 (H needs to be in stack1).\n3. Move A from stack3 to stack2 (A needs to be in stack3, but B is on top of it in the goal state).\n4. Move G from stack3 to stack1 (G needs to be in stack1).\n5. Move B from stack2 to stack3 (B needs to be in stack3).\n6. Move E from stack2 to stack2 (E is already in the correct stack but needs to be under D).\n7. Move F from stack2 to stack1 (F needs to be in stack1).\n8. Move K from stack2 to stack2 (K is already in the correct stack but needs to be on top of E).\n9. Move I from stack2 to stack1 (I needs to be in stack1).\n10. Move C from stack2 to stack2 (C is already in the correct stack but needs to be on the bottom).\n11. Move J from stack1 to stack1 (J is already in the correct stack but needs to be on the bottom).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove D from 4 to 2\nMove H from 4 to 1\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove K from 2 to 2\nMove I from 2 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 2\nMove J from 1 to 1\n>>>"
