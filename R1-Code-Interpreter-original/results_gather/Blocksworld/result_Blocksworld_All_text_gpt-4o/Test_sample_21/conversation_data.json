    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: F\n- stack3: G C\n- stack4: A B D E H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D E\n- stack2: G H\n- stack3: A C F\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move H from stack4 to stack2**: This is necessary because H needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n2. **Move E from stack4 to stack1**: E needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n3. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: D needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n4. **Move B from stack4 to stack1**: B needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n5. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: A needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n6. **Move C from stack3 to stack3**: C is already in the correct stack but needs to be on top of A.\n7. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: F needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n8. **Move G from stack3 to stack2**: G needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack2  \nMove E from stack4 to stack1  \nMove D from stack4 to stack1  \nMove B from stack4 to stack1  \nMove A from stack4 to stack3  \nMove C from stack3 to stack3  \nMove F from stack2 to stack3  \nMove G from stack3 to stack2  \n>>>"
