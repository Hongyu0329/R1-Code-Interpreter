    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G E B\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: C D H F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D F G\n- stack2: A C E H\n- stack3: B\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: A\n   - stack3: F\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration in each stack.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to eventually place it under G).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to eventually place it under E).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to place it at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to place it under A).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to place it alone in stack3).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack2 (to place it under C).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 2\n>>>"
