    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D I\n- stack2: H A C\n- stack3: F B E\n- stack4: G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A B C D F\n- stack2: E H I\n- stack3: G\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: I\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: E\n   - stack4: G\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to build stack1 as A B C D F, stack2 as E H I, and stack3 as G.\n   - Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to free D for later).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 (to start building stack1).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to continue building stack1).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (to free E for later).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to start building stack2).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to continue building stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack1 (to complete stack1).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (to continue building stack2).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack2 (to complete stack2).\n\n4. **Ensure stack3 is correct:**\n   - Stack3 already has G, which is correct.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack1\nMove H from stack2 to stack2\nMove I from stack2 to stack2\n>>>"
