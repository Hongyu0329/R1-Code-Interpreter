    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: G A F E C\n     - stack2: J H B\n     - stack3: I D\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: A B D F I\n     - stack2: C H\n     - stack3: E G J\n\n2. **Identify the Top Blocks:**\n   - Initial top blocks:\n     - stack1: C\n     - stack2: B\n     - stack3: D\n\n3. **Plan Moves to Achieve the Goal State:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the order in the goal state, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to free up E).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 (to free up F).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to position D above B).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack1 (to position I at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to position G at the bottom of stack3).\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack3 (to position J at the top of stack3).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct position).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack1 (F is already in the correct position).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack1 (A is already in the correct position).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to position B above A).\n\n5. **Verify the Final State:**\n   - stack1: A B D F I\n   - stack2: C H\n   - stack3: E G J\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove I from 3 to 1\nMove G from 1 to 3\nMove J from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\n>>>"
