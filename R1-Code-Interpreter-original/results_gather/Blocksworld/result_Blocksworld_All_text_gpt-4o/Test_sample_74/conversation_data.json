    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B G F\n- stack2: A E C\n- stack3: D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D F G\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A B C\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move D to stack1 to match the goal state.\n   - Move C to stack3 to free up E in stack2.\n   - Move A to stack3 to match the goal state.\n   - Move E to stack2 to match the goal state.\n   - Move B to stack3 to match the goal state.\n   - Move D to stack1 to match the goal state.\n   - Move F to stack1 to match the goal state.\n   - Move G to stack1 to match the goal state.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\n>>>\n\nThis sequence of moves will transform the initial state into the goal state."
