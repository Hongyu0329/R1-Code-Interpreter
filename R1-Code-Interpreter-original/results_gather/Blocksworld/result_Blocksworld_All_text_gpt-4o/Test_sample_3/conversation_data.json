    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A D\n- stack2: \n- stack3: F B\n- stack4: E C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: A B C F\n- stack3: D\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack4 to stack2**: This frees up E to be moved to its goal position.\n2. **Move E from stack4 to stack1**: E is now in its correct position in stack1.\n3. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: This clears stack1 for A to be moved to stack2.\n4. **Move A from stack1 to stack2**: A is now in its correct position in stack2.\n5. **Move B from stack3 to stack2**: B is now in its correct position in stack2.\n6. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: F is now in its correct position in stack2.\n7. **Move D from stack3 to stack3**: D is already in its correct position in stack3, so no move is needed.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from 4 to 2\nMove E from 4 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 2\n>>>"
