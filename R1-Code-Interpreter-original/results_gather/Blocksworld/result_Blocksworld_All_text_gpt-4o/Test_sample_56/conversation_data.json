    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: A\n   - stack3: B C E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: B C D E\n   - stack2: A\n   - stack3: \n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We cannot create new stacks; we can only use the existing three stacks.\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the order B C D E in stack1.\n   - Stack2 should remain with A.\n   - Stack3 should be empty.\n\n5. **Step-by-step Moves:**\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to start building the goal stack).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to continue building the goal stack).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to continue building the goal stack).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (temporarily move D to free up stack1).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 (temporarily move E to free up stack1).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (place D in the correct position in stack1).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (place E in the correct position in stack1).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - After these moves, stack1 will have B C D E in the correct order, stack2 will have A, and stack3 will be empty.\n\nHere is the series of moves to achieve the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\n>>>"
