    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: I\n- stack2: G C H A E\n- stack3: F B\n- stack4: D K J\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D F I J\n- stack2: G H\n- stack3: B C E K\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: I\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: B\n   - stack4: J\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to form the goal stacks. Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move J from stack4 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move K from stack4 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack3 (B is already in the correct stack but needs to be on top of C and E).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct stack but needs to be on top of G).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack2 (G is already in the correct stack).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove J from 4 to 1\nMove K from 4 to 3\nMove D from 4 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 3\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove H from 2 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 2\n>>>"
