    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: I D B\n- stack2: G J A C E\n- stack3: H F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: E H\n- stack2: A G\n- stack3: B C D F I J\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: F\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to their respective positions in the goal state, starting with the topmost blocks and working our way down.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to clear stack3 for further moves).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack3 (to clear stack2 for further moves).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack2 (to position A correctly in stack2).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack2 (to position G correctly in stack2).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove J from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack2\nMove G from stack2 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove I from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
