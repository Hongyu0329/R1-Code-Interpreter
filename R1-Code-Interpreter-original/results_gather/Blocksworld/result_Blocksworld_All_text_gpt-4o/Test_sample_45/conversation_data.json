    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: E D C\n- stack2: F B\n- stack3: A\n- stack4: (empty)\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: C D\n- stack3: A B F\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - This will free up D to be moved and start forming the goal configuration in stack2.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E D\n     - stack2: F B C\n     - stack3: A\n     - stack4: \n\n2. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - This completes the goal configuration for stack2.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: F B C D\n     - stack3: A\n     - stack4: \n\n3. **Move D from stack2 to stack4**: \n   - Temporarily move D to stack4 to access C.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: F B C\n     - stack3: A\n     - stack4: D\n\n4. **Move C from stack2 to stack4**: \n   - Temporarily move C to stack4 to access B.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: F B\n     - stack3: A\n     - stack4: D C\n\n5. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - This starts forming the goal configuration in stack3.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: F\n     - stack3: A B\n     - stack4: D C\n\n6. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - This completes the goal configuration for stack3.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: \n     - stack3: A B F\n     - stack4: D C\n\n7. **Move C from stack4 to stack2**: \n   - Start forming the goal configuration in stack2.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: C\n     - stack3: A B F\n     - stack4: D\n\n8. **Move D from stack4 to stack2**: \n   - This completes the goal configuration for stack2.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: C D\n     - stack3: A B F\n     - stack4: \n\nNow, the configuration matches the goal state.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack4\nMove C from stack2 to stack4\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack4 to stack2\n>>>"
