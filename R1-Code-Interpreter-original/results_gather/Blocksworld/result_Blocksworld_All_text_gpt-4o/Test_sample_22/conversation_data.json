    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: I A G\n- stack2: D F E\n- stack3: H B C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C H\n- stack2: F G I\n- stack3: A D E\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: C\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the order in the goal state, starting from the top of each stack in the goal state.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the top of stack1 in the goal state).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming stack1 in the goal state).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1 in the goal state).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to clear stack2 for the goal state).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack2 (F is already in the correct position, but we need to move it to access D).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3 (to start forming stack3 in the goal state).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming stack2 in the goal state).\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to complete stack2 in the goal state).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3 (to complete stack3 in the goal state).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 2\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove I from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 3\n>>>"
