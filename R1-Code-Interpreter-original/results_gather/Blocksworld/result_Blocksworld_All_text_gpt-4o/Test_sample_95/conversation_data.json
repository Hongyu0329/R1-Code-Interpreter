    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State Analysis:**\n   - stack1: J C\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: H G A E D\n   - stack4: F B I\n\n2. **Goal State Analysis:**\n   - stack1: B H\n   - stack2: A D E F G I\n   - stack3: C J\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block from any stack.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move I from stack4 to stack2 (to clear stack4 for B).\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack4 to stack2 (to clear stack4 for H).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Ensure all stacks match the goal state.\n\nHere is the series of moves to reach the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove J from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
