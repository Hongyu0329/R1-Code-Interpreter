    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: G C A F\n- stack3: B I E H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A F H\n- stack2: C G I\n- stack3: B D E\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: F\n   - stack3: H\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the order in the goal state, starting with the topmost blocks and working our way down.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to clear the way for D to move to stack3).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack3 (no actual move needed, B is already in the correct position).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack2 (no actual move needed, C is already in the correct position).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack2 (no actual move needed, G is already in the correct position).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove I from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
