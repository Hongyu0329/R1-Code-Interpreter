    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: A J\n- stack3: H F C E I\n- stack4: B G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: F I\n- stack2: A B C D G\n- stack3: E H J\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: J\n   - stack3: I\n   - stack4: G\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to form the goal stacks. Start by moving blocks that are already in the correct order or can be easily placed.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move G from stack4 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove G from 4 to 2\nMove B from 4 to 2\nMove J from 2 to 3\nMove I from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 2\n>>>"
