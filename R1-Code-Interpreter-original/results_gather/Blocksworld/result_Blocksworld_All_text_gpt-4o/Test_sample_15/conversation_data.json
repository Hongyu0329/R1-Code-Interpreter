    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: E D\n- stack2: A B\n- stack3: C\n- stack4: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A E\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: C D\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: (empty)\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move D from stack1 to stack3 to make room for A on stack1.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack4 to free A.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 to achieve the goal for stack1.\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack4 to make room for D on stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack1 to complete stack1.\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack2 to complete stack2.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack4.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack4.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack1.\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack2.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack4\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack1 to stack4\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\n>>>"
