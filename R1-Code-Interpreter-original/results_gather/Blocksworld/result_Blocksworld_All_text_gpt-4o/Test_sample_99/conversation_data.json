    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: E A\n- stack3: C B\n- stack4: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: B D E\n- stack3: \n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move B from stack3 to stack4**: This frees up C to be moved to its goal position.\n2. **Move C from stack3 to stack1**: C is now in its goal position.\n3. **Move A from stack2 to stack1**: A is now in its goal position.\n4. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This clears stack2 to allow B and D to be moved there.\n5. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: D is now in its goal position.\n6. **Move B from stack4 to stack2**: B is now in its goal position.\n7. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: E is now in its goal position.\n\nNow, all blocks are in their respective goal positions.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove B from 3 to 4\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove B from 4 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\n>>>"
