    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: B\n- stack3: C A E D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A B E\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - Initial: stack3: C A E D\n   - After move: stack1: D, stack3: C A E\n\n2. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - Initial: stack3: C A E\n   - After move: stack2: B E, stack3: C A\n\n3. **Move A from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - Initial: stack3: C A\n   - After move: stack1: D A, stack3: C\n\n4. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - Initial: stack3: C\n   - After move: stack2: B E C, stack3: \n\n5. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - Initial: stack2: B E C\n   - After move: stack1: D A C, stack2: B E\n\n6. **Move A from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - Initial: stack1: D A C\n   - After move: stack1: D C, stack3: A\n\n7. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - Initial: stack1: D C\n   - After move: stack1: D, stack2: B E C\n\n8. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - Initial: stack2: B E C\n   - After move: stack2: E C, stack3: A B\n\n9. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - Initial: stack2: E C\n   - After move: stack2: C, stack3: A B E\n\nNow, the stacks match the goal state:\n\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A B E\n\nThe series of moves to achieve the goal state is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\n>>>"
