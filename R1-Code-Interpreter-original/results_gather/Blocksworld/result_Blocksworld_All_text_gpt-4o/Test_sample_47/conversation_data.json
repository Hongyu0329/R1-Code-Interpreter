    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D G E C\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: F\n- stack4: B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D G\n- stack2: A C\n- stack3: B E F\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the differences between the initial and goal states:**\n   - stack1 needs to have only D and G.\n   - stack2 needs to have A and C.\n   - stack3 needs to have B, E, and F.\n   - stack4 is not needed in the goal state.\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 to start forming the correct stack2.\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 to start forming the correct stack3.\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack3 to complete the correct stack3.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed as F is already in stack3).\n   - stack1 is now correct with D and G.\n   - stack2 is now correct with A and C.\n   - stack3 is now correct with B, E, and F.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack3.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack3\n>>>"
