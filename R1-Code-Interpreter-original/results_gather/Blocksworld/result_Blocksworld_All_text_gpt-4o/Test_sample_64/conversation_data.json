    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G C\n- stack2: D A E B\n- stack3: I H F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B I\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A C D F G H\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: C\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: F\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move B to stack1.\n   - We need to move I to stack1.\n   - We need to move E to stack2.\n   - We need to move A, C, D, F, G, H to stack3 in the correct order.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack2 (E is already in stack2, so no move is needed).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack3 (F is already in stack3, so no move is needed).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack3 (H is already in stack3, so no move is needed).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\n>>>\n\nThis sequence of moves will transform the initial state into the goal state."
