    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: K D I G B J\n- stack3: H C E A F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A E F\n- stack2: B G K\n- stack3: C D H I J\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: (empty)\n   - stack2: J\n   - stack3: F\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each top block:**\n   - J should be in stack3.\n   - F should be in stack1.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack3.\n\n4. **Continue moving blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move K from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack3.\n\n5. **Ensure all blocks are in their final positions:**\n   - stack1: A E F\n   - stack2: B G K\n   - stack3: C D H I J\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove J from 2 to 3\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\n>>>"
