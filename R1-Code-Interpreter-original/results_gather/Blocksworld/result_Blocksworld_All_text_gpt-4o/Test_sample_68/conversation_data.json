    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: H D\n- stack2: E J A C F\n- stack3: B I G K\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B E I J K\n- stack2: A C D F\n- stack3: G H\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: F\n   - stack3: K\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - B should be on stack1.\n   - E should be on stack1.\n   - I should be on stack1.\n   - J should be on stack1.\n   - K should be on stack1.\n   - A should be on stack2.\n   - C should be on stack2.\n   - D should be on stack2.\n   - F should be on stack2.\n   - G should be on stack3.\n   - H should be on stack3.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move K from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move H from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Execute the Moves:**\n\n1. Move K from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move I from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n4. Move J from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move D from stack1 to stack2.\n7. Move H from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove K from 3 to 1\nMove I from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove J from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove H from 1 to 3\n>>>"
