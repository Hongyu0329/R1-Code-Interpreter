    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A E F\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: D H G\n- stack4: I\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C D E\n- stack2: A F G H\n- stack3: I\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: G\n   - stack4: I\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the order in the goal state.\n   - We can only move the top block from each stack.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move I from stack4 to stack3 (to match the goal state for stack3).\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack1 (E is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack2 (to complete the goal state for stack2).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove I from 4 to 3\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 2\n>>>"
