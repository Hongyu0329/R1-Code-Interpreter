    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: E D B H F\n- stack3: G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A G H\n- stack2: F\n- stack3: B C D E\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: This frees up H to be moved next.\n   - stack1: A C\n   - stack2: E D B H\n   - stack3: G F\n\n2. **Move H from stack2 to stack1**: H needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n   - stack1: A C H\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: G F\n\n3. **Move C from stack1 to stack3**: This allows G to be moved to stack1.\n   - stack1: A H\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: G F C\n\n4. **Move G from stack3 to stack1**: G needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n   - stack1: A H G\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: F C\n\n5. **Move H from stack1 to stack3**: This allows A to be at the bottom of stack1.\n   - stack1: A G\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: F C H\n\n6. **Move G from stack1 to stack3**: This allows A to be at the bottom of stack1.\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: F C H G\n\n7. **Move A from stack1 to stack1**: A is already in the correct position.\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: F C H G\n\n8. **Move G from stack3 to stack1**: G needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n   - stack1: A G\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: F C H\n\n9. **Move H from stack3 to stack1**: H needs to be on stack1 in the goal state.\n   - stack1: A G H\n   - stack2: E D B\n   - stack3: F C\n\n10. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: This allows B to be moved to stack3.\n    - stack1: A G H\n    - stack2: E D B C\n    - stack3: F\n\n11. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: B needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n    - stack1: A G H\n    - stack2: E D C\n    - stack3: F B\n\n12. **Move C from stack2 to stack3**: C needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n    - stack1: A G H\n    - stack2: E D\n    - stack3: F B C\n\n13. **Move D from stack2 to stack3**: D needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n    - stack1: A G H\n    - stack2: E\n    - stack3: F B C D\n\n14. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: E needs to be on stack3 in the goal state.\n    - stack1: A G H\n    - stack2: \n    - stack3: F B C D E\n\n15. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: F needs to be on stack2 in the goal state.\n    - stack1: A G H\n    - stack2: F\n    - stack3: B C D E\n\nNow, the stacks match the goal state.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
