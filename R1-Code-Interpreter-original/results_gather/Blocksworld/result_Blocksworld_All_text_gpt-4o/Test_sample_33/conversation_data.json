    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A\n- stack2: E B D F\n- stack3: G C\n- stack4: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D E F\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: B C\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move F from stack2 to stack4**: This frees up D, which needs to be moved to stack1 eventually.\n2. **Move D from stack2 to stack1**: This starts forming the bottom of stack1 as per the goal state.\n3. **Move E from stack2 to stack4**: This clears the way for B to be moved.\n4. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: This places B in its goal position.\n5. **Move C from stack3 to stack4**: This clears stack3 for G to be moved.\n6. **Move G from stack3 to stack2**: This places G in its goal position.\n7. **Move C from stack4 to stack3**: This places C back on top of B, completing stack3.\n8. **Move E from stack4 to stack1**: This continues forming stack1.\n9. **Move F from stack4 to stack1**: This completes stack1.\n\nBy following these steps, we achieve the goal state. Here is the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack2 to stack4\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack4\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack4\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
