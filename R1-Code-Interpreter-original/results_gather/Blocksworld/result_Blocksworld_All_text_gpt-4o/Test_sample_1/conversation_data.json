    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: A B\n- stack3: D\n- stack4: C E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: A D E\n- stack3: B C\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: None\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D\n   - stack4: E\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - A should remain in stack2.\n   - B should move to stack3.\n   - C should move to stack3.\n   - D should move to stack2.\n   - E should move to stack2.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack1 to free C.\n   - Move C from stack4 to stack3.\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack2 to start forming the goal stack2.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 to form the goal stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 to complete the goal stack2.\n\n**Execution of Moves:**\n\n- Move E from stack4 to stack1\n- Move C from stack4 to stack3\n- Move E from stack1 to stack2\n- Move B from stack2 to stack3\n- Move D from stack3 to stack2\n\nBy following these steps, we achieve the goal state.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove E from 4 to 1\nMove C from 4 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove D from 3 to 2\n>>>"
