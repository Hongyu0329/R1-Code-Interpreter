    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: G A E F C B\n- stack3: D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D E\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: B C F\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: (empty)\n   - stack2: B (top block)\n   - stack3: D (top block)\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. The goal is to have A, D, E on stack1; G on stack2; and B, C, F on stack3.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal:**\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to start forming the base of stack3).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to continue forming stack3).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to complete stack3).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming stack1).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming stack1).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to complete stack1).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack2 (G is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\nFollowing the above plan, the series of moves to reach the goal state is:\n\n<<<\nMove B from 2 to 3  \nMove C from 2 to 3  \nMove F from 2 to 3  \nMove E from 2 to 1  \nMove A from 2 to 1  \nMove D from 3 to 1  \n>>>\n"
