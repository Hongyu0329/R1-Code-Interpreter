    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G B F E D A\n- stack2: \n- stack3: C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: C G\n- stack2: A D E\n- stack3: B F\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move A from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - Initial: stack1: G B F E D A\n   - After move: stack1: G B F E D, stack2: A, stack3: C\n\n2. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - Initial: stack1: G B F E D\n   - After move: stack1: G B F E, stack2: A D, stack3: C\n\n3. **Move E from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - Initial: stack1: G B F E\n   - After move: stack1: G B F, stack2: A D E, stack3: C\n\n4. **Move C from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - Initial: stack3: C\n   - After move: stack1: G B F C, stack2: A D E, stack3: \n\n5. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - Initial: stack1: G B F C\n   - After move: stack1: G B C, stack2: A D E, stack3: F\n\n6. **Move B from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - Initial: stack1: G B C\n   - After move: stack1: G C, stack2: A D E, stack3: B F\n\nNow, the stacks match the goal state.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove D from 1 to 2\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove B from 1 to 3\n>>>"
