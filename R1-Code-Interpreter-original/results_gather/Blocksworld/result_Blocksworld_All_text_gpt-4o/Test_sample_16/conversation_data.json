    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: C A F\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: D E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: A C D\n- stack3: E F\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: E\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. The goal is to have:\n     - stack1: B\n     - stack2: A C D\n     - stack3: E F\n\n3. **Move sequence:**\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to free up A and C).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to free up D).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to continue forming the goal stack2).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack2 (to complete the goal stack2).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to achieve the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 1\n>>>"
