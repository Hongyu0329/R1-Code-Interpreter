    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G I D\n- stack2: E A K\n- stack3: C B H J F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A D F\n- stack2: B H I J K\n- stack3: C E G\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: K\n   - stack3: F\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - A should be on stack1.\n   - D should be on stack1.\n   - F should be on stack1.\n   - B should be on stack2.\n   - H should be on stack2.\n   - I should be on stack2.\n   - J should be on stack2.\n   - K should be on stack2.\n   - C should be on stack3.\n   - E should be on stack3.\n   - G should be on stack3.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move J from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move K from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Execute the moves:**\n\n1. Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move J from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n5. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n7. Move I from stack1 to stack2.\n8. Move G from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove J from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove I from 1 to 2\nMove G from 1 to 3\n>>>"
