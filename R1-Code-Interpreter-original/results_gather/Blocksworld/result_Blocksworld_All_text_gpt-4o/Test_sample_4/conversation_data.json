    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: F A G\n- stack2: E B\n- stack3: C D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A B D\n- stack2: G\n- stack3: C E F\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to clear stack1 to access A and move it to stack1's bottom.\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2 to free A.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 to start forming the goal stack1.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 to complete the goal stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 to make space for G.\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3 to complete the goal stack3.\n   - Finally, move G from stack2 to stack2 to complete the goal stack2.\n\n**Execution of Moves:**\n\n1. Move G from stack1 to stack2.\n2. Move A from stack1 to stack1 (no actual move needed, just a logical step).\n3. Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n4. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n5. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack2 (no actual move needed, just a logical step).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 2\n>>>"
