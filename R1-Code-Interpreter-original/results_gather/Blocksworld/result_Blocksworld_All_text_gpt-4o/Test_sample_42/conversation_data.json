    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: B C D E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: B E\n   - stack3: A C\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Only the top block of each stack can be moved.\n   - We can only use the existing three stacks.\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We will move blocks one at a time, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\n5. **Step-by-step Moves:**\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to free up D).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to place D in its goal position).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to free up B).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to place B in its goal position).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to place C in its goal position).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3 (to place A in its goal position).\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The moves are executed in the order that achieves the goal state.\n\nHere is the series of moves to reach the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 3\n>>>"
