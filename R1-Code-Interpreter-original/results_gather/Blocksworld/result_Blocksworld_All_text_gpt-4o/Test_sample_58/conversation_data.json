    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: C D B\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: F A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C F\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: D E\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: A\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to get A to the bottom of stack1, C above A, and F on top of C.\n   - B needs to be moved to stack2.\n   - D and E need to be moved to stack3.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to eventually place it at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to place it above A later).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to make space for B in stack2).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to place it above C in stack1).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack1 (to place it above A in stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal state for stack1).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack1 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
