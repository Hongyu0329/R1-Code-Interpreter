    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: D E\n   - stack2: A I G\n   - stack3: C B\n   - stack4: K F J H\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A C D G\n   - stack2: E F H I J K\n   - stack3: B\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the desired order in each stack.\n   - We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We need to ensure that each move is valid and contributes towards reaching the goal state.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move H from stack4 to stack2 (to free up J).\n   - Move J from stack4 to stack2 (to free up F).\n   - Move F from stack4 to stack2 (to free up K).\n   - Move K from stack4 to stack2 (stack4 is now empty).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack4 (to free up C).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack4 (to free up I).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack4 (to free up A).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to form the base of goal stack1).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack4 (to free up E).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack2).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack1 (to continue forming goal stack1).\n   - Move I from stack4 to stack2 (to continue forming goal stack2).\n   - Move G from stack4 to stack1 (to complete goal stack1).\n   - Move B from stack4 to stack3 (to complete goal stack3).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Ensure each move is valid and contributes to the goal state.\n\nHere is the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack4 to stack2\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove F from stack4 to stack2\nMove K from stack4 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack4\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack4\nMove I from stack2 to stack4\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack4\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove I from stack4 to stack2\nMove G from stack4 to stack1\nMove B from stack4 to stack3\n>>>"
