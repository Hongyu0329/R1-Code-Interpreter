    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: H B F\n- stack2: I\n- stack3: G C D\n- stack4: J A E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C D F G\n- stack2: E J\n- stack3: B H I\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move E from stack4 to stack2**: This frees up A to be moved next.\n2. **Move A from stack4 to stack1**: A is now in its correct position in stack1.\n3. **Move J from stack4 to stack2**: This completes stack2 as per the goal state.\n4. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: D is now in its correct position in stack1.\n5. **Move C from stack3 to stack1**: C is now in its correct position in stack1.\n6. **Move G from stack3 to stack1**: G is now in its correct position in stack1.\n7. **Move F from stack1 to stack3**: This frees up space in stack1 for the next moves.\n8. **Move B from stack1 to stack3**: B is now in its correct position in stack3.\n9. **Move H from stack1 to stack3**: H is now in its correct position in stack3.\n10. **Move I from stack2 to stack3**: I is now in its correct position in stack3.\n11. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: F is now in its correct position in stack1.\n\nBy following these steps, we achieve the goal state. Here is the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack1\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
