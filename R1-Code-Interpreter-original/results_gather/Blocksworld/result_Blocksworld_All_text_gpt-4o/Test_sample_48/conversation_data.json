    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B G\n- stack2: F E A C\n- stack3: H D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A B F\n- stack2: D E\n- stack3: C G H\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - A should be on stack1.\n   - B should be on stack1.\n   - F should be on stack1.\n   - D should be on stack2.\n   - E should be on stack2.\n   - C should be on stack3.\n   - G should be on stack3.\n   - H should be on stack3.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 to free B.\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 to free A.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 to start forming the goal stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1 to continue forming the goal stack1.\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 to form the goal stack2.\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\n**Execute the Moves:**\n\n1. Move G from stack1 to stack3.\n2. Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n3. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n4. Move F from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n- The stacks should now be in the goal state.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```\n<<<Move G from stack1 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack2>>>\n```"
