    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D B\n- stack2: \n- stack3: C\n- stack4: A E F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D\n- stack2: A C E F\n- stack3: \n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: (empty)\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: F\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move D to the top of stack1 and B to the bottom.\n   - We need to move A, C, E, and F to stack2 in the correct order.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move F from stack4 to stack2 (to clear stack4 for A).\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack2 (to clear stack4 for A).\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to clear stack1 for D).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack1 (to place D at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (to place B on top of D in stack1).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove F from stack4 to stack2\nMove E from stack4 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack1\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
