    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: E C J\n- stack2: H D\n- stack3: G I A B F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C D E F G\n- stack2: B H J\n- stack3: I\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: J\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: F\n\n2. **Plan to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to form the goal stacks. Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to eventually place it in stack1).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to eventually place it in stack2).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to eventually place it in stack1).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack3 (I is already in the correct stack, but we need to clear the way for other blocks).\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to eventually place it in stack1).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack1 (to eventually place it in stack1).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct stack, but we need to clear the way for other blocks).\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack2 (to eventually place it in stack2).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack1 (C is already in the correct stack, but we need to clear the way for other blocks).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack1 (E is already in the correct stack, but we need to clear the way for other blocks).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 1\nMove I from 3 to 3\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove D from 2 to 1\nMove H from 2 to 2\nMove J from 1 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 1\nMove E from 1 to 1\n>>>"
