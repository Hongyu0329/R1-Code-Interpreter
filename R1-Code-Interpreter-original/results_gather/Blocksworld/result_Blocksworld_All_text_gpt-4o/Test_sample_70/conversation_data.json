    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A\n- stack2: E C\n- stack3: D B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: A C\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: B\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - A should be on stack3.\n   - B should be on stack1.\n   - C should be on stack3.\n   - D should be on stack1.\n   - E should be on stack2.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 to free E.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 to start forming the goal stack1.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 to complete stack1.\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3 to start forming the goal stack3.\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place).\n\n**Execute the moves:**\n\n1. Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n2. Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n3. Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n4. Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove A from 1 to 3\n>>>"
