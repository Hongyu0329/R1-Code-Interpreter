    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: F B I K A\n     - stack2: H D\n     - stack3: J E C G\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: C G\n     - stack2: A B D E I K\n     - stack3: F H J\n\n2. **Identify the Top Blocks:**\n   - Initial top blocks:\n     - stack1: A\n     - stack2: D\n     - stack3: G\n\n3. **Plan Moves to Achieve the Goal State:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration in each stack.\n   - The goal is to have:\n     - stack1: C G\n     - stack2: A B D E I K\n     - stack3: F H J\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move K from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place)\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack1\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3\n   - Move J from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed, already in place)\n\n5. **Verify the Final Configuration:**\n   - stack1: C G\n   - stack2: A B D E I K\n   - stack3: F H J\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove K from 1 to 2\nMove I from 1 to 2\nMove B from 1 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 1\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove H from 2 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\n>>>"
