    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: E B F D\n- stack3: \n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B\n- stack2: F\n- stack3: A C D E\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - This frees up F to be moved next.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: A C\n     - stack2: E B F\n     - stack3: D\n\n2. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: \n   - This is a redundant move, so we skip it.\n\n3. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: \n   - This is a redundant move, so we skip it.\n\n4. **Move F from stack2 to stack2**: \n   - This is a redundant move, so we skip it.\n\n5. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - This allows us to move B next.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: A C\n     - stack2: E B\n     - stack3: F D\n\n6. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - This places B in its goal position.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: A C B\n     - stack2: E\n     - stack3: F D\n\n7. **Move C from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - This frees up A to be moved next.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: A B\n     - stack2: E\n     - stack3: C F D\n\n8. **Move A from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - This places A in its goal position.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: B\n     - stack2: E\n     - stack3: A C F D\n\n9. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - This places E in its goal position.\n   - New state:\n     - stack1: B\n     - stack2: \n     - stack3: E A C F D\n\n10. **Reorder stack3 to match the goal state**:\n    - Move D from stack3 to stack2\n    - Move F from stack3 to stack2\n    - Move C from stack3 to stack2\n    - Move A from stack3 to stack2\n    - Move E from stack3 to stack2\n    - Move A from stack2 to stack3\n    - Move C from stack2 to stack3\n    - Move D from stack2 to stack3\n    - Move E from stack2 to stack3\n    - Move F from stack2 to stack3\n\n**Final Moves:**\n- Move D from stack2 to stack3\n- Move F from stack2 to stack3\n- Move C from stack2 to stack3\n- Move A from stack2 to stack3\n- Move E from stack2 to stack3\n- Move A from stack3 to stack2\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2\n- Move D from stack3 to stack2\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2\n- Move F from stack3 to stack2\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
