    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: I J F\n- stack2: B G E C\n- stack3: H D A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C H I J\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: A E F G\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: A\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to their respective positions in the goal state, starting with the top blocks and working our way down.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (A is already in the correct position).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack1 (J is already in the correct position).\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack1 (I is already in the correct position).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove F from 1 to 3\nMove H from 3 to 1\n>>>"
