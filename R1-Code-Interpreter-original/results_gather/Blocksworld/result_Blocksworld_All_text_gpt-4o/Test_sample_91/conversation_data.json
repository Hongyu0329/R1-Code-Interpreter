    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: H C A F\n   - stack4: D G\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: D E G H\n   - stack2: B C F\n   - stack3: A\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration.\n   - We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We need to carefully plan the moves to avoid unnecessary steps.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to free A).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (to achieve the goal state for stack3).\n   - Move G from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1 (to complete the goal state for stack1).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to achieve the goal state for stack2).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The moves should be executed in the order that achieves the goal state efficiently.\n\nHere is the series of moves to reach the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 3\nMove G from 4 to 1\nMove D from 4 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\n>>>"
