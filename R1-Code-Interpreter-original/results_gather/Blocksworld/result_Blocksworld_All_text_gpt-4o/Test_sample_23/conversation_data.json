    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B I\n- stack2: G F\n- stack3: C D E\n- stack4: A H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: E\n- stack2: A D\n- stack3: B C F G H I\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move E to stack1**: \n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1.\n\n2. **Move D to stack2**:\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n\n3. **Move C to stack3**:\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (no actual move needed, but conceptually placing it correctly).\n\n4. **Move A to stack2**:\n   - Move H from stack4 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack2.\n\n5. **Move B to stack3**:\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n\n6. **Move F to stack3**:\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n\n7. **Move G to stack3**:\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n\n8. **Move H to stack3**:\n   - H is already in stack3, no move needed.\n\n9. **Move I to stack3**:\n   - I is already in stack3, no move needed.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove A from stack4 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
