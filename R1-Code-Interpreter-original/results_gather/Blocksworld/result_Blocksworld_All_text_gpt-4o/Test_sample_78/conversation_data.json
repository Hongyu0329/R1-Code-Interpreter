    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: F I H\n- stack2: G A E C B\n- stack3: D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: E F G\n- stack3: B D H I\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: H\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: D\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - A and C need to be in stack1.\n   - E, F, and G need to be in stack2.\n   - B, D, H, and I need to be in stack3.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 to free up stack3 for B, H, and I.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1 temporarily to access A.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack1 back to stack2.\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move H from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Execute the Moves:**\n\n1. Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n2. Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n3. Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n4. Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n5. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n6. Move E from stack1 to stack2.\n7. Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move F from stack1 to stack2.\n9. Move I from stack1 to stack3.\n10. Move H from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove I from 1 to 3\nMove H from 1 to 3\n>>>"
