    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D\n- stack2: B E\n- stack3: F C G A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B F G\n- stack2: A C D\n- stack3: E\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: D\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: A\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to their respective positions in the goal state, starting with the topmost blocks and working our way down.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2 (to position A in stack2).\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to position G in stack1).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to position C in stack2).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1 (to position F in stack1).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to position E in stack3).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to position B in stack1).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to position D in stack2).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 2\n>>>"
