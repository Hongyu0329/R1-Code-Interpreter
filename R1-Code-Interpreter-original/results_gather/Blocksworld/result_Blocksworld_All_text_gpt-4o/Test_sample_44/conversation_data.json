    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: E A B C\n- stack2: \n- stack3: D F\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C E\n- stack2: B F\n- stack3: D\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: C\n   - stack2: (empty)\n   - stack3: F\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - A should be in stack1.\n   - B should be in stack2.\n   - C should be in stack1.\n   - D should be in stack3.\n   - E should be in stack1.\n   - F should be in stack2.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 to free up B.\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 to reach its goal position.\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 to reach its goal position.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 to reach its goal position.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed as D is already in the correct stack).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed as E is already in the correct stack).\n\n4. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
