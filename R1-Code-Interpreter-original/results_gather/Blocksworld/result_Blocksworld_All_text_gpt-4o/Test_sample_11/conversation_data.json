    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. We will follow the rules of only moving the top block from any stack and moving one block at a time. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: B A F J\n   - stack4: C G D H I\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: C D\n   - stack2: E F I\n   - stack3: A B G H J\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position and are on top of their respective stacks.\n\n4. **Steps:**\n   - Move I from stack4 to stack2 (to position I correctly).\n   - Move H from stack4 to stack3 (to position H correctly).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack1 (to position D correctly).\n   - Move G from stack4 to stack3 (to position G correctly).\n   - Move C from stack4 to stack1 (to position C correctly).\n   - Move J from stack3 to stack3 (J is already in the correct stack, no move needed).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to position F correctly).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (A is already in the correct stack, no move needed).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack3 (B is already in the correct stack, no move needed).\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - We will execute the moves in the order planned to achieve the goal state.\n\nHere is the series of moves to reach the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack4 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack3\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove C from stack4 to stack1\nMove F from stack3 to stack2\n>>>"
