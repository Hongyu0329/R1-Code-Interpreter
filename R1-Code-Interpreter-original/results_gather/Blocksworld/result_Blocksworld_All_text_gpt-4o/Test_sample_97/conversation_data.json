    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: H J A B\n- stack2: F I K C\n- stack3: \n- stack4: G E D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C D E I K\n- stack2: A H J\n- stack3: F G\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks**: \n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: (empty)\n   - stack4: D\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state**:\n   - We need to move blocks to form the sequences in the goal state.\n   - Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Execute the moves**:\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack3 (to free up E).\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming the sequence D E in stack1).\n   - Move G from stack4 to stack3 (to form the sequence F G in stack3).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack1 (to form the sequence B C in stack1).\n   - Move K from stack2 to stack1 (to form the sequence I K in stack1).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to complete the sequence F G in stack3).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming the sequence A H J in stack2).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move H from stack1 to stack2.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove G from stack4 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack1\nMove K from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove J from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack2\n>>>"
