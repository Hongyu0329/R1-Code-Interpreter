    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: G B D\n- stack3: A I C E H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: E G H\n- stack2: A D I\n- stack3: B C F\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: H\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to their respective positions in the goal state, starting with the top blocks and working our way down.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1: E G H).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1: E G H).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3: B C F).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2: A D I).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2: A D I).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack2 (to form part of the goal stack2: A D I).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3: B C F).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack1 (to form part of the goal stack1: E G H).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to form part of the goal stack3: B C F).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove H from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 3\nMove I from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove D from 2 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove F from 1 to 3\n>>>"
