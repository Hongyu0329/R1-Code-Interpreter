    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: C\n     - stack2: B E A J F\n     - stack3: G I\n     - stack4: D H\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: E\n     - stack2: A B C D H\n     - stack3: F G I J\n\n2. **Identify the Top Blocks:**\n   - stack1: C\n   - stack2: F\n   - stack3: I\n   - stack4: H\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block of each stack.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to free up J).\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack3 (to free up A).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming stack2 in the goal state).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to complete stack1 in the goal state).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming stack2 in the goal state).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack2 (to continue forming stack2 in the goal state).\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack2 (to continue forming stack2 in the goal state).\n   - Move H from stack4 to stack2 (to complete stack2 in the goal state).\n\n5. **Verify the Goal State:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: A B C D H\n   - stack3: F G I J\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove J from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 1\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 2\nMove D from 4 to 2\nMove H from 4 to 2\n>>>"
