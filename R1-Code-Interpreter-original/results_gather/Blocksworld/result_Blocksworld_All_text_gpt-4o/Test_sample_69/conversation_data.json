    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: H I B E A\n     - stack2: J\n     - stack3: G\n     - stack4: F D K C\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: H\n     - stack2: B C F G I\n     - stack3: A D E J K\n\n2. **Identify the Top Blocks:**\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: J\n   - stack3: G\n   - stack4: C\n\n3. **Plan Moves to Achieve the Goal State:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the desired configuration in each stack.\n   - We can only move the top block from each stack.\n\n4. **Execute Moves:**\n   - Move C from stack4 to stack2\n   - Move K from stack4 to stack3\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack3\n   - Move F from stack4 to stack2\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack2\n   - Move J from stack2 to stack3\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2\n   - Move H from stack1 to stack1 (no move needed, already in place)\n\n5. **Verify the Goal State:**\n   - stack1: H\n   - stack2: B C F G I\n   - stack3: A D E J K\n\nThe moves are planned to ensure that each block is moved according to the rules and ends up in the correct stack as per the goal state.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<Move C from 4 to 2\nMove K from 4 to 3\nMove D from 4 to 3\nMove F from 4 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 2\nMove J from 2 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 3\nMove B from 1 to 2\nMove I from 1 to 2>>>"
