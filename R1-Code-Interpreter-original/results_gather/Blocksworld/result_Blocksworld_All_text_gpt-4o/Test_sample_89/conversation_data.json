    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: C B\n- stack3: E\n- stack4: A F D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: B D E G\n- stack3: F\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack4 to stack2**: This frees up F to be moved and starts building the goal stack2.\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: C B D\n   - stack3: E\n   - stack4: A F\n\n2. **Move F from stack4 to stack3**: This places F in its final position.\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: C B D\n   - stack3: E F\n   - stack4: A\n\n3. **Move A from stack4 to stack1**: This starts building the goal stack1.\n   - stack1: G A\n   - stack2: C B D\n   - stack3: E F\n   - stack4: (empty)\n\n4. **Move F from stack3 to stack4**: Temporarily move F to free up E.\n   - stack1: G A\n   - stack2: C B D\n   - stack3: E\n   - stack4: F\n\n5. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: This places E in its final position.\n   - stack1: G A\n   - stack2: C B D E\n   - stack3: (empty)\n   - stack4: F\n\n6. **Move F from stack4 to stack3**: Return F to its final position.\n   - stack1: G A\n   - stack2: C B D E\n   - stack3: F\n   - stack4: (empty)\n\n7. **Move A from stack1 to stack4**: Temporarily move A to free up G.\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: C B D E\n   - stack3: F\n   - stack4: A\n\n8. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: This places G in its final position.\n   - stack1: (empty)\n   - stack2: C B D E G\n   - stack3: F\n   - stack4: A\n\n9. **Move A from stack4 to stack1**: Return A to its final position.\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: C B D E G\n   - stack3: F\n   - stack4: (empty)\n\n10. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: This completes the goal stack1.\n    - stack1: A C\n    - stack2: B D E G\n    - stack3: F\n    - stack4: (empty)\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove D from 4 to 2\nMove F from 4 to 3\nMove A from 4 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 4\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove F from 4 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 4\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove A from 4 to 1\nMove C from 2 to 1\n>>>"
