    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: D A E C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: F\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: A B D\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: F\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: C\n\n2. **Goal Analysis:**\n   - stack1 should remain as F.\n   - stack2 should have C and E.\n   - stack3 should have A, B, and D.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 to start forming the goal state for stack2.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 to complete the goal state for stack2.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed as A is already in stack3).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 to start forming the goal state for stack3.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed as D is already in stack3).\n\n**Execution of Moves:**\n\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2\n- Move E from stack3 to stack2\n- Move B from stack2 to stack3\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\nThe moves required to achieve the goal state are:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove B from 2 to 3\n>>>"
