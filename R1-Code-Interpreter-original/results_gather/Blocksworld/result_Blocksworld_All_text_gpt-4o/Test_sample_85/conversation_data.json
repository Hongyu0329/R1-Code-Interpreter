    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D C E\n- stack2: A\n- stack3: \n- stack4: B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C D\n- stack2: B\n- stack3: E\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: A\n   - stack3: (empty)\n   - stack4: B\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move E to stack3 to free up C and D for rearrangement.\n   - Move A to stack1 to start forming the goal state for stack1.\n   - Move B to stack2 to achieve the goal state for stack2.\n   - Finally, rearrange C and D on stack1.\n\n**Moves:**\n\n1. Move E from stack1 to stack3.\n2. Move A from stack2 to stack1.\n3. Move B from stack4 to stack2.\n4. Move D from stack1 to stack4.\n5. Move C from stack1 to stack1 (no actual move needed, just rearranging in the same stack).\n6. Move D from stack4 to stack1.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack1\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack1 to stack4\nMove C from stack1 to stack1\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
