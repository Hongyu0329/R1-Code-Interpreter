    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Initial State:\n- stack1: B K J C\n- stack2: F H\n- stack3: D E G I A\n\n### Goal State:\n- stack1: C D F I K\n- stack2: B H J\n- stack3: A E G\n\n### Analysis and Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks**:\n   - stack1: C\n   - stack2: H\n   - stack3: A\n\n2. **Plan the moves**:\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. We will start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Move A to stack3**:\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (no move needed as A is already in stack3).\n\n4. **Move C to stack1**:\n   - C is already on stack1, so no move is needed.\n\n5. **Move D to stack1**:\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1.\n\n6. **Move F to stack1**:\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1.\n\n7. **Move I to stack1**:\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack1.\n\n8. **Move K to stack1**:\n   - K is already on stack1, so no move is needed.\n\n9. **Move B to stack2**:\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move K from stack1 to stack2.\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2.\n\n10. **Move H to stack2**:\n    - H is already on stack2, so no move is needed.\n\n11. **Move J to stack2**:\n    - J is already on stack2, so no move is needed.\n\n12. **Move E to stack3**:\n    - E is already on stack3, so no move is needed.\n\n13. **Move G to stack3**:\n    - G is already on stack3, so no move is needed.\n\n### Final Moves:\nFollowing the above analysis, here are the moves:\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack3 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove J from stack1 to stack2\nMove K from stack1 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\n>>>\n"
