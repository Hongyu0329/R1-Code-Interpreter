    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: B\n- stack3: G D F A C\n- stack4: E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A B D F\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: G\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move C from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - This move is necessary to start forming the stack2 in the goal state.\n\n2. **Move A from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - A is needed at the bottom of stack1 in the goal state.\n\n3. **Move F from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - F is needed above A in stack1.\n\n4. **Move D from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - D is needed above F in stack1.\n\n5. **Move B from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - B is needed at the top of stack1.\n\n6. **Move E from stack4 to stack2**: \n   - E is needed above C in stack2.\n\n7. **Move G from stack3 to stack3**: \n   - G is already in the correct position in stack3.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\nFollowing these steps, the series of moves to reach the goal state is:\n\n<<<\nMove C from 3 to 2  \nMove A from 3 to 1  \nMove F from 3 to 1  \nMove D from 3 to 1  \nMove B from 2 to 1  \nMove E from 4 to 2  \n>>>"
