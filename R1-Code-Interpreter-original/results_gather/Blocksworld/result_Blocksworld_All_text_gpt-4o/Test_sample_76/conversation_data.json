    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: H E D F A\n- stack2: G B\n- stack3: C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: A B D E\n- stack3: C F H\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: C\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal state configuration. Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack2 (to start forming the sequence A B D E in stack2).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3 (to make room for G in stack1 and to eventually place F in stack3).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack2 (to continue forming the sequence A B D E in stack2).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack2 (to complete the sequence A B D E in stack2).\n   - Move H from stack1 to stack3 (to place H in stack3 as per the goal state).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack1 (to place G in stack1 as per the goal state).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack1 to stack2\nMove F from stack1 to stack3\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
