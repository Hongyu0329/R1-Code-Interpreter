    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial configuration to the goal configuration, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: E B\n   - stack2: A D C\n   - stack3: \n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: A B C D E\n\n3. **Rules:**\n   - We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We can only use the existing stacks (stack1, stack2, stack3).\n\n4. **Plan:**\n   - We need to move all blocks to stack3 in the order A, B, C, D, E.\n   - Start by moving blocks from stack1 and stack2 to stack3, ensuring the order is maintained.\n\n5. **Step-by-step Moves:**\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: A D, stack3: C)\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: A, stack3: C D)\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: , stack3: C D A)\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 (stack1: E, stack2: B)\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack3 (stack1: , stack3: C D A E)\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: , stack3: C D A E B)\n   - Rearrange stack3 to achieve the correct order:\n     - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (stack1: B, stack3: C D A E)\n     - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (stack2: E, stack3: C D A)\n     - Move A from stack3 to stack2 (stack2: E A, stack3: C D)\n     - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (stack2: E A D, stack3: C)\n     - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (stack2: E A D C, stack3: )\n     - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: E A D, stack3: C)\n     - Move D from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: E A, stack3: C D)\n     - Move A from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: E, stack3: C D A)\n     - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (stack2: , stack3: C D A E)\n     - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (stack1: , stack3: C D A E B)\n\n6. **Final Moves:**\n   - The blocks are now in the correct order in stack3: A B C D E.\n\nThe series of moves to reach the goal state is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack2\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove C from stack2 to stack3\nMove D from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
