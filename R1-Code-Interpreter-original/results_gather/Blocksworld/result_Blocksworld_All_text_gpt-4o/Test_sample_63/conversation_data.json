    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: D\n- stack3: G F B\n- stack4: A H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C D E F G H\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move H from stack4 to stack2**: \n   - This frees up A to be moved to stack3, as required by the goal state.\n\n2. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: \n   - Now stack3 has A at the bottom, as required by the goal state.\n\n3. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - B is the first block in the goal state for stack1.\n\n4. **Move F from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - This allows us to access G, which needs to be moved to stack1.\n\n5. **Move G from stack3 to stack1**: \n   - G is now in the correct position in stack1 according to the goal state.\n\n6. **Move F from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - F is now in the correct position in stack1 according to the goal state.\n\n7. **Move D from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - D is now in the correct position in stack1 according to the goal state.\n\n8. **Move H from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - This clears stack2 and allows us to move C and E to stack1.\n\n9. **Move E from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - This allows us to move C to the correct position in stack1.\n\n10. **Move C from stack1 to stack1**: \n    - C is now in the correct position in stack1 according to the goal state.\n\n11. **Move E from stack2 to stack1**: \n    - E is now in the correct position in stack1 according to the goal state.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove H from 4 to 2\nMove A from 4 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove D from 2 to 1\nMove H from 2 to 3\nMove E from 1 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 1\n>>>"
