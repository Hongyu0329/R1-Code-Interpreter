    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: J B\n- stack2: F I E\n- stack3: D A C H G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C G H I J\n- stack2: D F\n- stack3: A E\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: G\n\n2. **Plan to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to form the goal stacks. Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to free I and position E correctly).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack1 (to position I correctly).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack2 (to position F correctly).\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack1 (to position G correctly).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack1 (to position H correctly).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to position C correctly).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (to position A correctly).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to position D correctly).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack1 (to position B correctly).\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack1 (to position J correctly).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove G from stack3 to stack1\nMove H from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove A from stack3 to stack3\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack1\nMove J from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
