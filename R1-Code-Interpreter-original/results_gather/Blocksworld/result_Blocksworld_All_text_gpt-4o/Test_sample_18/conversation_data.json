    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: F A C\n   - stack3: B D E\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A D G\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: B C E F\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration.\n   - We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We need to ensure that the final configuration of each stack matches the goal state.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2 (to free up stack1 for A).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to free up A).\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to clear stack2).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2 (to free up D).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to clear stack2 again).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack1 (to complete stack1).\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to rearrange for the goal stack3).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2 (to clear stack3).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3 (to complete stack3).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - Ensure that each stack matches the goal state.\n\nHere is the series of moves to achieve the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove G from 1 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 3\n>>>"
