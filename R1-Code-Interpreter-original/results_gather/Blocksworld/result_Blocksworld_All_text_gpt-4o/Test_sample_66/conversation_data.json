    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state of the stacks into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B A\n- stack2: C F G\n- stack3: D I E J H\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A E I\n- stack2: B C J\n- stack3: D F G H\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks of each stack:**\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: G\n   - stack3: H\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - A should be on stack1.\n   - B should be on stack2.\n   - C should be on stack2.\n   - D should remain on stack3.\n   - E should be on stack1.\n   - F should remain on stack3.\n   - G should remain on stack3.\n   - H should remain on stack3.\n   - I should be on stack1.\n   - J should be on stack2.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to free up J).\n   - Move J from stack3 to stack2 (to its final position).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to its final position).\n   - Move I from stack3 to stack1 (to its final position).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to its final position).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to its final position).\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack2 (already in the correct stack, but needs to be under B).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack2 (to its final position).\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack1 (already in the correct stack).\n\n**Execute the moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove J from stack3 to stack2\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove I from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack2 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove A from stack1 to stack1\n>>>"
