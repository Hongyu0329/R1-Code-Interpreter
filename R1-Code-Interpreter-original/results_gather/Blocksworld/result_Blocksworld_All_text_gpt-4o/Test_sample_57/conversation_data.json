    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to achieve the goal state. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D A\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: \n- stack4: E\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: \n- stack2: A C D E\n- stack3: B\n\n**Steps to achieve the goal:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: \n   - This frees up A to be moved and also positions D to be moved later to stack2.\n\n2. **Move A from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - A is now in its final position in stack2.\n\n3. **Move C from stack2 to stack1**: \n   - This frees up B to be moved to its final position.\n\n4. **Move B from stack2 to stack3**: \n   - B is now in its final position in stack3.\n\n5. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: \n   - C is now in its final position in stack2.\n\n6. **Move D from stack3 to stack2**: \n   - D is now in its final position in stack2.\n\n7. **Move E from stack4 to stack2**: \n   - E is now in its final position in stack2.\n\nBy following these steps, we achieve the goal state. Here is the series of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove E from 4 to 2\n>>>"
