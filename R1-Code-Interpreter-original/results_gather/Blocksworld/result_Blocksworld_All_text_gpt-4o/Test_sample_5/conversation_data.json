    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D C F B\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: \n- stack4: G A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B F G\n- stack2: C E\n- stack3: A D\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move A from stack4 to stack3**: This frees up G to be moved later and starts building stack3.\n2. **Move G from stack4 to stack1**: This begins forming the bottom of stack1 in the goal state.\n3. **Move B from stack1 to stack3**: This clears the way to move F and C, and B is needed in stack3.\n4. **Move F from stack1 to stack2**: This allows C to be moved and F is not needed in stack2.\n5. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This completes the bottom of stack2 in the goal state.\n6. **Move E from stack2 to stack3**: This allows us to move F to its correct position.\n7. **Move F from stack2 to stack1**: This places F in its correct position in stack1.\n8. **Move D from stack1 to stack3**: This completes stack3 in the goal state.\n9. **Move B from stack3 to stack1**: This completes stack1 in the goal state.\n10. **Move E from stack3 to stack2**: This completes stack2 in the goal state.\n11. **Move A from stack3 to stack3**: This is already in the correct position.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove A from 4 to 3\nMove G from 4 to 1\nMove B from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 2\nMove C from 1 to 2\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 1\nMove D from 1 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 1\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 3\n>>>"
