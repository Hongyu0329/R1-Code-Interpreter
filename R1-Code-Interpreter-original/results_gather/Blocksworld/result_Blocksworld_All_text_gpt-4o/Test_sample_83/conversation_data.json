    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: G A E C\n- stack2: H I F\n- stack3: K\n- stack4: J B D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: A C\n- stack2: J\n- stack3: B D E F G H I K\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. We need to clear stack1 to have only A and C.\n2. We need to move J to stack2.\n3. We need to move B, D, E, F, G, H, I, and K to stack3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Moves:**\n\n1. Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to free A).\n2. Move E from stack1 to stack3 (to free A).\n3. Move A from stack1 to stack3 (temporarily).\n4. Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to clear stack1).\n5. Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to place A in its goal position).\n6. Move D from stack4 to stack3 (to free J).\n7. Move B from stack4 to stack3 (to free J).\n8. Move J from stack4 to stack2 (to place J in its goal position).\n9. Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to clear stack2).\n10. Move I from stack2 to stack3 (to clear stack2).\n11. Move H from stack2 to stack3 (to clear stack2).\n12. Move C from stack3 to stack1 (to place C in its goal position).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove I from stack2 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack3\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\n>>>"
