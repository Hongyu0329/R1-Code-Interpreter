    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: C F\n   - stack2: E B G H\n   - stack3: A D\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B F\n   - stack2: H\n   - stack3: C D E G\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the desired order in each stack.\n   - We can only move the top block from any stack.\n   - We need to ensure that we don't block necessary moves by placing blocks in the wrong order.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Moves:**\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to free A for moving to stack1).\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1 (to start forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack2 (to free C for moving to stack3).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack3 (to start forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to continue forming the goal stack1).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to continue forming the goal stack3).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to complete the goal stack1).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3 (to complete the goal stack3).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct position, no move needed).\n\n5. **Final Moves:**\n   - The moves are planned to ensure that each stack is built correctly without blocking necessary moves.\n\nHere is the series of moves to reach the goal state:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack3 to stack1\nMove F from stack1 to stack2\nMove C from stack1 to stack3\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove G from stack2 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack2 to stack3\n>>>"
