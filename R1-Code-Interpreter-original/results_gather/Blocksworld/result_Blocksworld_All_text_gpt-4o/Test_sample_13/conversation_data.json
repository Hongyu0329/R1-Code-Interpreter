    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve the goal state:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: K I G\n- stack2: A F B\n- stack3: J E\n- stack4: C H D\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B E F H\n- stack2: A D I\n- stack3: C G J K\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: G\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: E\n   - stack4: D\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to form the sequences in the goal state.\n   - Start by moving blocks that are already in the correct stack but need to be rearranged.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move D from stack4 to stack2 (to position D under A).\n   - Move H from stack4 to stack1 (to position H under F).\n   - Move C from stack4 to stack3 (to position C at the bottom of stack3).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1 (to position B at the bottom of stack1).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1 (to position F under E).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to position E under B).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack3 (to position G under C).\n   - Move J from stack3 to stack3 (to position J under G).\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack2 (to position I under D).\n   - Move K from stack1 to stack3 (to position K under J).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack4 to stack2\nMove H from stack4 to stack1\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove B from stack2 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove G from stack1 to stack3\nMove J from stack3 to stack3\nMove I from stack1 to stack2\nMove K from stack1 to stack3\n>>>"
