    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: G I F\n- stack3: C B H A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B C E F I\n- stack2: G H\n- stack3: A D\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: F\n   - stack3: A\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to form the goal stacks. Start by moving blocks that are not in their goal position.\n\n3. **Move blocks to achieve the goal state:**\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack3 (A is already in the correct stack, but we need to clear the way for other blocks).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2 (H needs to be on stack2).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1 (B needs to be on stack1).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack1 (C needs to be on stack1).\n   - Move D from stack1 to stack3 (D needs to be on stack3).\n   - Move E from stack1 to stack1 (E is already in the correct stack).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack1 (F needs to be on stack1).\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack1 (I needs to be on stack1).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove A from stack3 to stack3\nMove H from stack3 to stack2\nMove B from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack1 to stack1\nMove F from stack2 to stack1\nMove I from stack2 to stack1\n>>>"
