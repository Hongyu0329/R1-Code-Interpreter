    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: J\n- stack2: D H F I B A G\n- stack3: E C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: G I\n- stack2: A B C D E F H\n- stack3: J\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks:**\n   - stack1: J\n   - stack2: G\n   - stack3: C\n\n2. **Plan the moves:**\n   - We need to move G to stack1 and J to stack3.\n   - We need to move C to stack2.\n   - We need to rearrange the blocks in stack2 to match the goal state.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move J from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove G from 2 to 1\nMove J from 1 to 3\nMove C from 3 to 2\nMove E from 3 to 2\nMove D from 2 to 3\nMove H from 2 to 3\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 1\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 3\nMove B from 3 to 2\nMove A from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\n>>>"
