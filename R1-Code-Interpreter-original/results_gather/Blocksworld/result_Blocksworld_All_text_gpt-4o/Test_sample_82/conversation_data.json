    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: F A\n- stack2: K D E B I C\n- stack3: H J G\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: G\n- stack2: B D\n- stack3: A C E F H I J K\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: A\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: G\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - G should be on stack1.\n   - B and D should be on stack2.\n   - A, C, E, F, H, I, J, K should be on stack3.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move G from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move J from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move I from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack2 (no move needed, already in place).\n   - Move K from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n   - Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Execute the moves:**\n\n1. Move G from stack3 to stack1.\n2. Move J from stack3 to stack2.\n3. Move H from stack3 to stack2.\n4. Move C from stack2 to stack3.\n5. Move I from stack2 to stack3.\n6. Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n7. Move K from stack2 to stack3.\n8. Move A from stack1 to stack3.\n9. Move F from stack1 to stack3.\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove G from 3 to 1\nMove J from 3 to 2\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove C from 2 to 3\nMove I from 2 to 3\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove K from 2 to 3\nMove A from 1 to 3\nMove F from 1 to 3\n>>>"
