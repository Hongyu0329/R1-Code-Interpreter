    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: C E\n- stack2: \n- stack3: A\n- stack4: D B\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: B C\n- stack3: A\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Move B from stack4 to stack2**: This frees up D to be moved and starts forming the goal stack2.\n   - stack1: C E\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: D\n\n2. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: This places D in its final position in stack1.\n   - stack1: C E D\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: \n\n3. **Move D from stack1 to stack4**: Temporarily move D to free up C.\n   - stack1: C E\n   - stack2: B\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: D\n\n4. **Move C from stack1 to stack2**: This completes the goal stack2.\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: D\n\n5. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: Move D back to its final position in stack1.\n   - stack1: E D\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: \n\n6. **Move D from stack1 to stack4**: Temporarily move D to free up E.\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: D\n\n7. **Move E from stack1 to stack4**: Temporarily move E to free up stack1.\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: D E\n\n8. **Move E from stack4 to stack1**: Move E back to its final position in stack1.\n   - stack1: E\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: D\n\n9. **Move D from stack4 to stack1**: Move D back to its final position in stack1.\n   - stack1: D E\n   - stack2: B C\n   - stack3: A\n   - stack4: \n\nNow, the stacks match the goal state.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack4 to stack2\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack4\nMove C from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack1 to stack4\nMove E from stack1 to stack4\nMove E from stack4 to stack1\nMove D from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
