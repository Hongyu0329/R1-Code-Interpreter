    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving one block at a time, ensuring that only the top block of any stack can be moved. Let's analyze the steps required:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: D B\n- stack2: E\n- stack3: C\n- stack4: A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A B\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: B\n   - stack2: E\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: A\n\n2. **Determine the final position of each block:**\n   - D should remain at the bottom of stack1.\n   - E should be moved to stack1 on top of D.\n   - C should be moved to stack2.\n   - A should be moved to stack3.\n   - B should be moved to stack3 on top of A.\n\n3. **Plan the moves:**\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack3 (to make room for E on stack1).\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack1 (to achieve the goal for stack1).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2 (to achieve the goal for stack2).\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to achieve the goal for stack3).\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack3 (B is already on stack3, so no move is needed, but it should be on top of A).\n\n**Execute the moves:**\n\n- Move B from stack1 to stack3.\n- Move E from stack2 to stack1.\n- Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n- Move A from stack4 to stack3.\n\n**Final State:**\n- stack1: D E\n- stack2: C\n- stack3: A B\n\nThis matches the goal state. Now, let's format the moves as required:\n\n<<<\nMove B from stack1 to stack3\nMove E from stack2 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack2\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\n>>>"
