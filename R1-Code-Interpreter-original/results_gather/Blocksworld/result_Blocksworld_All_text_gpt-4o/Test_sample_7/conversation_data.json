    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to carefully plan a series of moves to transform the initial state into the goal state. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial and Goal States:**\n   - Initial State:\n     - stack1: C\n     - stack2: G A B F\n     - stack3: D H\n     - stack4: E\n   - Goal State:\n     - stack1: A E\n     - stack2: C D\n     - stack3: B F G H\n\n2. **Identify the Top Blocks:**\n   - stack1: C\n   - stack2: F\n   - stack3: H\n   - stack4: E\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the goal configuration. We can only move the top block of each stack.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move E from stack4 to stack1 (to start forming stack1 in the goal state).\n   - Move H from stack3 to stack2 (to clear stack3 for B, F, G, H).\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2 (to start forming stack2 in the goal state).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack3 (to start forming stack3 in the goal state).\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move A from stack2 to stack1 (to complete stack1 in the goal state).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack3 (to complete stack3 in the goal state).\n   - Move C from stack1 to stack2 (to complete stack2 in the goal state).\n\n5. **Verify the Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A E\n   - stack2: C D\n   - stack3: B F G H\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove E from 4 to 1\nMove H from 3 to 2\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove F from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 3\nMove A from 2 to 1\nMove G from 2 to 3\nMove C from 1 to 2\n>>>"
