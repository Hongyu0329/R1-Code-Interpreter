    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B H G I D\n- stack2: A F\n- stack3: E\n- stack4: J C\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: H\n- stack2: A B D G\n- stack3: C E F I J\n\n**Steps to achieve the Goal State:**\n\n1. **Move D from stack1 to stack2**: This frees up I to be moved.\n2. **Move I from stack1 to stack3**: This allows G to be moved.\n3. **Move G from stack1 to stack2**: This is part of the goal configuration for stack2.\n4. **Move F from stack2 to stack3**: This allows A to be moved.\n5. **Move A from stack2 to stack2**: A is already in the correct stack.\n6. **Move B from stack1 to stack2**: This is part of the goal configuration for stack2.\n7. **Move H from stack1 to stack1**: H is already in the correct stack.\n8. **Move C from stack4 to stack3**: This is part of the goal configuration for stack3.\n9. **Move J from stack4 to stack3**: This is part of the goal configuration for stack3.\n10. **Move E from stack3 to stack3**: E is already in the correct stack.\n\nNow, let's list the moves in the required format:\n\n<<<\nMove D from stack1 to stack2\nMove I from stack1 to stack3\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack3\nMove A from stack2 to stack2\nMove B from stack1 to stack2\nMove H from stack1 to stack1\nMove C from stack4 to stack3\nMove J from stack4 to stack3\nMove E from stack3 to stack3\n>>>"
