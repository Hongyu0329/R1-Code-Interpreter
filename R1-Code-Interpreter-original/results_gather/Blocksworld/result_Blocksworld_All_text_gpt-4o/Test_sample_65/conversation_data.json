    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to transform the initial state into the goal state by moving blocks one at a time, following the rules provided. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n**Initial State:**\n- stack1: B G I\n- stack2: F H D\n- stack3: E C\n- stack4: A\n\n**Goal State:**\n- stack1: B D E I\n- stack2: F G H\n- stack3: A C\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the top blocks in each stack:**\n   - stack1: I\n   - stack2: D\n   - stack3: C\n   - stack4: A\n\n2. **Plan the moves to achieve the goal state:**\n   - We need to move blocks to achieve the order in the goal state, ensuring that we only move the top block of any stack.\n\n3. **Execute the moves:**\n   - Move I from stack1 to stack4 (to free up B).\n   - Move G from stack1 to stack2 (to free up B).\n   - Move B from stack1 to stack1 (B is already in the correct position, but we need to clear the stack).\n   - Move D from stack2 to stack1 (to place D on top of B).\n   - Move E from stack3 to stack1 (to place E on top of D).\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack3 (C is already in the correct position, but we need to clear the stack).\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack3 (to place A on top of C).\n   - Move H from stack2 to stack2 (H is already in the correct position, but we need to clear the stack).\n   - Move F from stack2 to stack2 (F is already in the correct position, but we need to clear the stack).\n   - Move G from stack2 to stack2 (G is already in the correct position, but we need to clear the stack).\n   - Move I from stack4 to stack1 (to place I on top of E).\n\n**Final Moves:**\n\n<<<\nMove I from stack1 to stack4\nMove G from stack1 to stack2\nMove D from stack2 to stack1\nMove E from stack3 to stack1\nMove C from stack3 to stack3\nMove A from stack4 to stack3\nMove H from stack2 to stack2\nMove F from stack2 to stack2\nMove G from stack2 to stack2\nMove I from stack4 to stack1\n>>>"
