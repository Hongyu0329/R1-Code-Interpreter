    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step using the available lifters optimally. The constraints allow for multiple lifters to combine their capacities to lift a single box if necessary.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combination of lifters.\n\n2. **Greedy Assignment**: In each step, try to assign the heaviest available box to the strongest available lifter or combination of lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters starting from the strongest until the box can be lifted.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process, moving to the next step once all lifters are used or no more boxes can be lifted in the current step.\n\n4. **Check Step Limit**: Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [41, 69, 80, 19, 54, 85, 64, 35]\nlifters = [45, 45, 62, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n            # Try to find a single lifter or combination of lifters to lift the box\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [j]))\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try combinations if a single lifter cannot lift the box\n                for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        continue\n                    total_capacity = lifters[j]\n                    lifter_indices = [j]\n                    for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                        if used_lifters[k]:\n                            continue\n                        if total_capacity + lifters[k] >= box:\n                            lifter_indices.append(k)\n                            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                            for idx in lifter_indices:\n                                used_lifters[idx] = True\n                            break\n                        total_capacity += lifters[k]\n                        lifter_indices.append(k)\n                    if len(step) > len(boxes) - i:\n                        break\n        # Remove lifted boxes\n        boxes = [box for box, _ in step if box not in [b for b, _ in step]]\n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 4:\n            break\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the optimal solution.",
