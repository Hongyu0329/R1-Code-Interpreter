    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 4 steps allowed. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes and lifters to make it easier to match them. We will try to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are more restrictive in terms of lifter combinations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n3. Try to assign the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n4. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes and lifters until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [82, 61, 91, 29, 20, 43, 57, 79]\nlifters = [49, 80, 79]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(4):  # Maximum 4 steps\n    step_lifts = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                # Single lifter can lift the box\n                step_lifts.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try combinations of lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        step_lifts.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifts)\n    \n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift all boxes in the minimum number of steps, using the constraints provided. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that all boxes were lifted in 4 steps, which is within the allowed limit. However, we should verify if this is indeed the most efficient solution. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**: \n   - Box 91 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1 (49 + 80 = 129, which is sufficient).\n   - Box 43 is lifted by lifter 2 (79, which is sufficient).\n\n2. **Step 2**:\n   - Box 82 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1 (49 + 80 = 129, which is sufficient).\n   - Box 29 is lifted by lifter 2 (79, which is sufficient).\n\n3. **Step 3**:\n   - Box 79 is lifted by lifter 0 (80, which is sufficient).\n   - Box 61 is lifted by lifter 1 (79, which is sufficient).\n   - Box 20 is lifted by lifter 2 (79, which is sufficient).\n\n4. **Step 4**:\n   - Box 57 is lifted by lifter 0 (80, which is sufficient).\n\nThe solution seems optimal given the constraints, as each step utilizes the maximum capacity of the lifters efficiently. The heaviest boxes are prioritized, and combinations of lifters are used when necessary.\n\nSince the solution is already optimal and meets the requirements, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(91, [0, 1]), (43, [2])]\nStep 2: [(82, [0, 1]), (29, [2])]\nStep 3: [(79, [0]), (61, [1]), (20, [2])]\nStep 4: [(57, [0])]\n>>>"
