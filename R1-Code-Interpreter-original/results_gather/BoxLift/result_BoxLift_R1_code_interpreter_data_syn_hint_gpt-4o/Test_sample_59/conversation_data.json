    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight, as heavier boxes are more challenging to lift and may require more lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity, as stronger lifters should be used for heavier boxes.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [299, 338, 270, 207, 76, 195, 101, 89, 277, 236, 240, 342, 47, 207, 220, 349, 185, 124, 309, 112, 266, 278, 162, 119]\nlifters = [198, 55, 76, 137, 163, 117, 146]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark this box as lifted\n    boxes = [b for b in boxes if b is not None]  # Remove lifted boxes\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters.
