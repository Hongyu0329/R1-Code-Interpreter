    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n5.
