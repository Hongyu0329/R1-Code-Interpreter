    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the rules provided. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n2. Multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n3. We need to minimize the number of steps, ideally using 4 or fewer steps.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes and lifters to facilitate the assignment process. We will try to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are more restrictive in terms of lifter combinations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n- Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n- Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n- Attempt to assign the heaviest boxes first, using the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\n```python\nboxes = [41, 31, 60, 20, 11, 26, 52, 98]\nlifters = [49, 55, 63]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(4):  # We have a maximum of 4 steps\n    step_assignments = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                # Single lifter can lift the box\n                step_assignments.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        step_assignments.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step_assignments)\n    \n    # Check if all boxes are lifted\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, while adhering to the constraints. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the boxes were successfully lifted in three steps, which is within the allowed four steps. However, let's ensure that the solution is optimal and adheres to all constraints.\n\nThe output indicates:\n- Step 1: The heaviest box (98) is lifted by lifters 0 and 1, and the box weighing 41 is lifted by lifter 2.\n- Step 2: The box weighing 60 is lifted by lifter 0, the box weighing 52 by lifter 1, and the box weighing 31 by lifter 2.\n- Step 3: The remaining boxes (26, 20, and 11) are lifted by lifters 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n\nThis solution is efficient and uses the minimum number of steps possible given the constraints. Each step utilizes the available lifters optimally, and all boxes are lifted within the allowed four steps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(98, [0, 1]), (41, [2])]\nStep 2: [(60, [0]), (52, [1]), (31, [2])]\nStep 3: [(26, [0]), (20, [1]), (11, [2])]>>>"
