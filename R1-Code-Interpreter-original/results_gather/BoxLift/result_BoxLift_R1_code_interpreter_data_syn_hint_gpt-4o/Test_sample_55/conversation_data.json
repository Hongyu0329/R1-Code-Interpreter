    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps allowed. We need to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help us efficiently match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes and lifters.\n2. Try to assign the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n3. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes and lifters until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [24, 78, 95, 23, 57, 36, 40, 26]\nlifters = [56, 51, 66, 65]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\ndef can_lift(box_weight, lifter_indices):\n    return sum(lifters[i] for i in lifter_indices) >= box_weight\n\ndef find_combination(box_weight, used_lifters):\n    n = len(lifters)\n    for i in range(1, 1 << n):\n        combination = [j for j in range(n) if (i & (1 << j)) and not used_lifters[j]]\n        if can_lift(box_weight, combination):\n            return combination\n    return None\n\nfor _ in range(3):  # Maximum 3 steps\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if not used_boxes[i]:\n            combination = find_combination(box, used_lifters)\n            if combination is not None:\n                step.append((box, combination))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                for idx in combination:\n                    used_lifters[idx] = True\n    if step:\n        steps.append(step)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the solution is efficient and within the constraints provided.",
    "The code execution result shows that the solution is able to lift all the boxes in 3 steps, which is within the allowed limit. However, let's ensure that the solution is optimal and follows the rules correctly. \n\nThe current solution uses a greedy approach by sorting the boxes and lifters in descending order and then trying to match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters. This approach seems to be working well for the given problem.\n\nLet's review the output:\n- Step 1: [(95, [0, 1]), (78, [2, 3])]\n  - Box 95 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1 (combined capacity: 56 + 51 = 107).\n  - Box 78 is lifted by lifters 2 and 3 (combined capacity: 66 + 65 = 131).\n- Step 2: [(57, [0]), (40, [1]), (36, [2]), (26, [3])]\n  - Each box is lifted by a single lifter.\n- Step 3: [(24, [0]), (23, [1])]\n  - Each box is lifted by a single lifter.\n\nThe solution is efficient and uses the minimum number of steps (3) to lift all the boxes. Each step adheres to the constraints, and all boxes are lifted successfully.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(95, [0, 1]), (78, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(57, [0]), (40, [1]), (36, [2]), (26, [3])]\nStep 3: [(24, [0]), (23, [1])]>>>"
