    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes and lifters to make it easier to match them efficiently. We will try to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are more likely to require multiple lifters.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n3. Try to assign the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters first.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process for each step until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [16, 56, 15, 82, 85, 12, 12, 32]\nlifters = [63, 48, 72, 68]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_lifting = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step_lifting.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no single lifter can lift the box, try to combine lifters\n            total_capacity = 0\n            lifter_indices = []\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j]:\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        step_lifting.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the output and determine the steps required to lift all the boxes.",
    "The code execution result shows that we have successfully lifted all the boxes in 3 steps. However, let's ensure that the solution is optimal and adheres to the constraints. The solution should be efficient, and we should verify that no further optimization is possible.\n\nLet's analyze the output:\n- Step 1: [(85, [0, 1]), (82, [2, 3])]\n  - Box 85 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1 (63 + 48 = 111, which is sufficient).\n  - Box 82 is lifted by lifters 2 and 3 (72 + 68 = 140, which is sufficient).\n\n- Step 2: [(56, [0]), (32, [1]), (16, [2]), (15, [3])]\n  - Box 56 is lifted by lifter 0 (63, which is sufficient).\n  - Box 32 is lifted by lifter 1 (48, which is sufficient).\n  - Box 16 is lifted by lifter 2 (72, which is sufficient).\n  - Box 15 is lifted by lifter 3 (68, which is sufficient).\n\n- Step 3: [(12, [0]), (12, [1])]\n  - Box 12 is lifted by lifter 0 (63, which is sufficient).\n  - Box 12 is lifted by lifter 1 (48, which is sufficient).\n\nThe solution is optimal as it uses the minimum number of steps (3) to lift all the boxes, and all constraints are satisfied. Each lifter is used only once per step, and multiple lifters are combined when necessary to lift heavier boxes.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(85, [0, 1]), (82, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(56, [0]), (32, [1]), (16, [2]), (15, [3])]\nStep 3: [(12, [0]), (12, [1])]\n>>>"
