    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes, and each lifter can only lift one box per step. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 9.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [355, 40, 260, 256, 250, 107, 301, 298, 72, 316, 50, 319, 243, 51, 393, 268, 141, 178, 270, 158, 354, 336, 55, 84]\nlifters = [100, 90, 66, 141, 184, 78, 50]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                    break\n        \n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n    \n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    for box, _ in step:\n        boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, using the minimum number of steps.
