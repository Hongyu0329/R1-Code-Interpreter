    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the constraints. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes, as they will require more lifters or stronger lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: \n   - Try to assign a single lifter to a box if possible.\n   - If a box is too heavy for any single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\n4. **Optimize for Minimum Steps**: Try to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [12, 90, 67, 10, 10, 94, 60, 46]\nlifters = [56, 77, 72]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(4):\n    current_step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                current_step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no single lifter can lift the box, try to combine lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        current_step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(current_step)\n    \n    # Check if all boxes are lifted\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor step_num, step in enumerate(steps, start=1):\n    print(f\"Step {step_num}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 4. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that all boxes were lifted in 4 steps, which is within the allowed limit. However, we should ensure that the solution is optimal and adheres to all constraints. Let's review the steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**: The heaviest box (94) is lifted by combining lifters 0 and 1, and the box weighing 46 is lifted by lifter 2.\n2. **Step 2**: The next heaviest box (90) is lifted by combining lifters 0 and 1, and the box weighing 12 is lifted by lifter 2.\n3. **Step 3**: The box weighing 67 is lifted by lifter 0, the box weighing 60 is lifted by lifter 1, and the box weighing 10 is lifted by lifter 2.\n4. **Step 4**: The remaining box weighing 10 is lifted by lifter 0.\n\nThe solution seems to be efficient, as it uses the minimum number of steps possible given the constraints. Each step maximizes the number of boxes lifted, and all lifters are utilized effectively.\n\nSince the solution is already optimal and meets the requirements, I will provide the final answer.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(94, [0, 1]), (46, [2])]\nStep 2: [(90, [0, 1]), (12, [2])]\nStep 3: [(67, [0]), (60, [1]), (10, [2])]\nStep 4: [(10, [0])]\n>>>"
