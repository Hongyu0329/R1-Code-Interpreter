    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes and lifters in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters. This approach will help us efficiently use the available lifting capacity.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes and lifters in descending order.\n2. Try to assign the heaviest available box to the strongest available lifter or combination of lifters.\n3. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [14, 13, 59, 47, 73, 64, 58, 75]\nlifters = [74, 57, 51]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(4):\n    current_step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                current_step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        current_step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(current_step)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the optimal steps for lifting all the boxes.",
    "The code execution result shows that all boxes have been lifted in 4 steps, which is within the allowed limit. However, the solution can be optimized further to ensure that we are using the minimum number of steps possible. Let's analyze the current solution and see if we can improve it.\n\nThe current solution uses 4 steps, and each step involves lifting the heaviest available boxes with the strongest available lifters or combinations of lifters. However, we can try to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes to potentially reduce the number of steps.\n\nLet's attempt a more strategic approach by considering combinations of lifters more effectively and ensuring that we maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step. We will use a greedy approach to try and lift as many boxes as possible in each step.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n1. Sort the boxes and lifters in descending order.\n2. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by considering both individual lifters and combinations of lifters.\n3.
