    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help us efficiently match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1. **Sort the boxes** in descending order: [97, 83, 76, 46, 45, 36, 30, 14]\n2. **Sort the lifters** in descending order: [69, 68, 59, 50]\n\n### Strategy:\n- Try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n- Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that are too heavy for a single lifter.\n- Ensure that all boxes are lifted in 3 steps or less.\n\n### Execution:\nLet's write a Python script to implement this strategy and find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [97, 83, 76, 46, 45, 36, 30, 14]\nlifters = [69, 68, 59, 50]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return list(combo)\n    return []\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters in steps\nsteps = []\nfor _ in range(3):  # Maximum 3 steps\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, remaining_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, lifter_combo))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for lifter in lifter_combo:\n                remaining_lifters.remove(lifter)\n    if step:\n        steps.append(step)\n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):\n    print(f\"Step {i}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 3 steps or less. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that all boxes are lifted in 3 steps, which is within the allowed limit. However, we should verify if this is indeed the most efficient solution. Let's analyze the output:\n\n- **Step 1**: The heaviest boxes (97 and 83) are lifted using combinations of lifters.\n- **Step 2**: The next heaviest box (76) is lifted using a combination, and two other boxes (46 and 45) are lifted individually.\n- **Step 3**: The remaining boxes (36, 30, and 14) are lifted individually.\n\nThe solution seems efficient, but let's ensure that no better combination exists that could reduce the number of steps or optimize the use of lifters. Given the constraints and the available lifters, this solution appears optimal because:\n\n1. The heaviest boxes are prioritized in the first step.\n2. Combinations of lifters are used effectively to lift boxes that are too heavy for a single lifter.\n3. All boxes are lifted within the 3-step limit.\n\nSince the solution meets all the requirements and constraints, we can conclude that this is an efficient solution.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(97, [69, 68]), (83, [59, 50])]\nStep 2: [(76, [69, 68]), (46, [59]), (45, [50])]\nStep 3: [(36, [69]), (30, [68]), (14, [59])]\n>>>"
