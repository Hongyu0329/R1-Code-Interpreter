    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight, as heavier boxes will likely require more lifters to lift. Similarly, we will sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities. This will help us efficiently match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\nWe will then iterate through the sorted list of boxes and try to assign lifters to each box. If a single lifter can lift a box, we assign that lifter. If not, we try to combine lifters to match or exceed the box's weight. We will keep track of the steps and ensure that we do not exceed the maximum number of steps allowed.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [169, 106, 153, 20, 138, 80, 94, 190, 142, 196, 186, 87]\nlifters = [55, 85, 43, 100, 47]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n\ndef can_lift(box_weight, lifters, used_lifters):\n    # Try to find a combination of lifters that can lift the box\n    current_weight = 0\n    lifter_indices = []\n    for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used_lifters[i] and current_weight < box_weight:\n            current_weight += capacity\n            lifter_indices.append(i)\n            used_lifters[i] = True\n        if current_weight >= box_weight:\n            return lifter_indices\n    return None\n\nfor _ in range(7):  # Maximum 7 steps\n    step = []\n    for box_weight in boxes:\n        lifter_indices = can_lift(box_weight, lifters, used_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifter_indices))\n            for idx in lifter_indices:\n                used_lifters[idx] = True\n    if step:\n        steps.append(step)\n    if len(steps) >= 7 or all(used_lifters):\n        break\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)  # Reset lifters for the next step\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible.
