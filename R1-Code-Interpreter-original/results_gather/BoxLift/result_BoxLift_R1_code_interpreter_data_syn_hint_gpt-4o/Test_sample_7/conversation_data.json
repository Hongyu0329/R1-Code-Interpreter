    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the rules provided. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 5 steps.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by:\n   - Assigning a single lifter to a box if the lifter's capacity is sufficient.\n   - Combining multiple lifters to lift a box if necessary.\n   - Ensuring that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Repeat the process**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in subsequent steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\n4. **Optimize for the minimum number of steps**: Ensure that the solution uses the fewest steps possible, ideally within the constraint of 5 steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [202, 297, 200, 241, 156, 177, 70, 78, 133, 176, 75, 70, 167, 240, 299, 91]\nlifters = [56, 160, 118, 138, 160, 150]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(5):\n    step_lifting = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if used_lifters[j]:\n                continue\n            if lifter >= box:\n                # Single lifter can lift the box\n                step_lifting.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            lifter_indices = []\n            total_capacity = 0\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j]:\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        for idx in lifter_indices:\n                            used_lifters[idx] = True\n                        step_lifting.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, while adhering to the constraints. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the boxes were successfully lifted in 5 steps, adhering to the constraints provided. However, let's ensure that the solution is optimal and all constraints are met:\n\n1. **Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step**: The solution lifts multiple boxes in each step.\n2. **Each lifter can only lift one box at a time**: Each lifter is used only once per step.\n3. **Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step**: This constraint is respected.\n4. **Multiple lifters can combine together to lift one box if the box is too heavy for a single lifter**: The solution combines lifters when necessary.\n5. **Try to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible**: The solution uses exactly 5 steps, which is the maximum allowed, but it is within the constraint.\n\nThe solution seems to be optimal given the constraints and the capacities of the lifters. Let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(299, [0, 1]), (297, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(241, [0, 1]), (240, [2, 3]), (167, [4, 5])]\nStep 3: [(202, [0, 1]), (200, [2, 3]), (156, [4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(177, [0, 1]), (176, [2, 3]), (133, [4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(91, [0]), (78, [1]), (75, [2]), (70, [3]), (70, [4])]\n>>>"
