    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps allowed. We need to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes and lifters to facilitate the assignment process. We will try to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are more restrictive in terms of lifter combinations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n3. In each step, try to assign the heaviest available box to the available lifters, using combinations if necessary.\n4. Repeat until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [70, 51, 67, 51, 34, 82, 20, 93]\nlifters = [64, 51, 79, 80]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters in steps\nsteps = []\nfor _ in range(3):  # Maximum of 3 steps\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        combo = find_lifter_combination(box, available_lifters)\n        if combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in combo]))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    if step:\n        steps.append(step)\n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):\n    print(f\"Step {i}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to assign the lifters to the boxes in the most efficient way possible, given the constraints. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the boxes were successfully lifted in 3 steps, which is within the allowed limit. However, let's ensure that the solution is optimal and follows all the constraints. \n\nThe approach taken was to sort the boxes and lifters in descending order and then try to lift the heaviest boxes first using available lifters. This is a reasonable strategy, but let's verify if there's a more efficient way to distribute the lifters across the steps.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: The heaviest box (93) is lifted by combining the two strongest lifters (64 and 51). The second heaviest box (82) is lifted by the next two strongest lifters (79 and 80).\n- **Step 2**: The remaining boxes are lifted by individual lifters since their weights are within the capacity of the available lifters.\n- **Step 3**: The lightest boxes are lifted by the remaining lifters.\n\nThis distribution seems efficient given the constraints. However, let's ensure that no better distribution exists by re-evaluating the combinations and ensuring that all constraints are met.\n\nSince the current solution already meets the requirements and constraints, and the code execution result is correct, we can conclude that the solution is optimal.\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(93, [0, 1]), (82, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(70, [0]), (67, [1]), (51, [2]), (51, [3])]\nStep 3: [(34, [0]), (20, [1])])>>>"
