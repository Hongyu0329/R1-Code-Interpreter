    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the rules provided. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 5 steps.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and lifters in descending order of capacity will help in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the strongest available lifter or a combination of lifters that can lift the box. Continue this process for each box in descending order of weight.\n\n3. **Track steps**: Keep track of the steps and ensure that each lifter is used only once per step. If a box cannot be lifted in the current step, move it to the next step.\n\n4. **Optimize for minimum steps**: Try to lift as many boxes as possible in each step by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [21, 25, 138, 168, 105, 127, 154, 55, 155, 125, 121, 58]\nlifters = [78, 98, 51, 75, 43]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(5):\n    current_step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if used_lifters[j]:\n                continue\n            if lifter >= box:\n                # Single lifter can lift the box\n                current_step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                total_capacity = lifters[j]\n                lifter_indices = [j]\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if total_capacity + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        lifter_indices.append(k)\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        current_step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        break\n                    total_capacity += lifters[k]\n                    lifter_indices.append(k)\n                    used_lifters[k] = True\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(current_step)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, adhering to the rules and minimizing the number of steps.
