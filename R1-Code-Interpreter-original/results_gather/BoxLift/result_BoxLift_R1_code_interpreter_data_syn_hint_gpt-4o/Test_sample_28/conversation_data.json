    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight, as heavier boxes will likely require more lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity, as stronger lifters should be used for heavier boxes.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [71, 72, 167, 64, 339, 45, 243, 53, 52, 280, 164, 322, 362, 75, 158, 142, 150, 353, 182, 282]\nlifters = [139, 55, 172, 82, 129, 59, 130]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(7):\n    step_lifting = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step_lifting.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters for the box\n            total_capacity = 0\n            lifter_indices = []\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j]:\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        for idx in lifter_indices:\n                            used_lifters[idx] = True\n                        step_lifting.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        break\n    \n    if not step_lifting:\n        break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 7. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the solution was able to lift all the boxes in 6 steps, which is within the allowed 7 steps. The approach used was to sort the boxes and lifters in descending order and then assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters. This strategy ensures that the heaviest boxes are prioritized and that the strongest lifters are utilized effectively.\n\nThe output indicates the steps required to lift all the boxes, with each step showing which lifters are assigned to which boxes. The solution is efficient and meets the problem's constraints.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(362, [0, 1, 2]), (322, [3, 4, 5, 6])]\nStep 2: [(353, [0, 1, 2]), (282, [3, 4, 5, 6])]\nStep 3: [(339, [0, 1, 2]), (280, [3, 4, 5, 6])]\nStep 4: [(243, [0, 1]), (182, [2, 3]), (167, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 5: [(164, [0]), (158, [1, 2]), (150, [3, 4]), (75, [5, 6])]\nStep 6: [(142, [0]), (72, [1]), (71, [2]), (64, [3]), (53, [4]), (52, [5]), (45, [6])]\n>>>"
