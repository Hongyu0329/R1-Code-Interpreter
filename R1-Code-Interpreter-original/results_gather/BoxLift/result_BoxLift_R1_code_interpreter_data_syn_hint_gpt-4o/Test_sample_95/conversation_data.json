    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps allowed. We need to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have boxes with weights: [79, 48, 16, 95, 67, 41, 62, 22]\n2. We have lifters with capacities: [52, 41, 41, 67]\n\nThe strategy is to:\n- First, try to lift the heaviest boxes using combinations of lifters.\n- Use individual lifters for boxes they can lift alone.\n- Ensure that all boxes are lifted in 3 steps or less.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to find an optimal solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [79, 48, 16, 95, 67, 41, 62, 22]\nlifters = [52, 41, 41, 67]\n\n# Function to check if a combination of lifters can lift a box\ndef can_lift(box_weight, lifter_indices):\n    return sum(lifters[i] for i in lifter_indices) >= box_weight\n\n# Function to find the best assignment of lifters to boxes\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    remaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n    \n    for step in range(3):  # Maximum of 3 steps\n        step_assignments = []\n        used_lifters = set()\n        \n        # Try to lift each box\n        for box_weight in sorted(remaining_boxes, reverse=True):\n            # Find a combination of lifters that can lift this box\n            for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n                for lifter_indices in combinations(range(len(lifters)), r):\n                    if set(lifter_indices).isdisjoint(used_lifters) and can_lift(box_weight, lifter_indices):\n                        step_assignments.append((box_weight, list(lifter_indices)))\n                        used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n        \n        # Remove lifted boxes from the list\n        for assignment in step_assignments:\n            remaining_boxes.remove(assignment[0])\n        \n        steps.append(step_assignments)\n        \n        # If all boxes are lifted, break\n        if not remaining_boxes:\n            break\n    \n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps for lifting all boxes\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, while respecting the constraints. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the boxes were successfully lifted in 3 steps, which is within the allowed limit. However, let's ensure that the solution is optimal and follows the rules correctly. The solution should be efficient and ensure that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's analyze the output:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Box 95 is lifted by lifters 0 and 3 (combined capacity: 52 + 67 = 119).\n  - Box 79 is lifted by lifters 1 and 2 (combined capacity: 41 + 41 = 82).\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Box 67 is lifted by lifter 3 (capacity: 67).\n  - Box 62 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1 (combined capacity: 52 + 41 = 93).\n  - Box 41 is lifted by lifter 2 (capacity: 41).\n\n- **Step 3**:\n  - Box 48 is lifted by lifter 0 (capacity: 52).\n  - Box 22 is lifted by lifter 1 (capacity: 41).\n  - Box 16 is lifted by lifter 2 (capacity: 41).\n\nThe solution seems to be optimal given the constraints, as it uses the maximum capacity of lifters in each step and ensures all boxes are lifted in 3 steps. \n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(95, [0, 3]), (79, [1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(67, [3]), (62, [0, 1]), (41, [2])]\nStep 3: [(48, [0]), (22, [1]), (16, [2])]\n>>>"
