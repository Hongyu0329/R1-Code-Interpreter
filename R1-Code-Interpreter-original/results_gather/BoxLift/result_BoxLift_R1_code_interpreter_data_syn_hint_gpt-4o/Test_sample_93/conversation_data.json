    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n2. Multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n3. We need to minimize the number of steps, ideally within 7 steps.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can approach this problem by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This way, we can try to match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters first.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to help us determine the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [64, 70, 386, 351, 113, 77, 314, 333, 266, 399, 193, 44, 181, 200, 238, 175, 370, 118, 337, 134]\nlifters = [140, 115, 159, 147, 129, 112]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, lifters):\n    from itertools import combinations\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return []\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters])\n        if lifter_indices:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps. It uses a greedy approach by trying to lift the heaviest boxes first with the available lifters. The `find_lifters_for_box` function finds the smallest combination of lifters that can lift a given box. The script then iterates over the boxes, assigning lifters and removing lifted boxes from the list.\n\nLet's execute this code to see the output.",
