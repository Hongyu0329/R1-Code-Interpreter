    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes while ensuring that all boxes are lifted within 7 steps.\n\n### Reasoning and Approach:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Greedy Assignment**: In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first by using the available lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to achieve the required capacity.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Steps**: Repeat the process for each step until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\n5. **Optimization**: Aim to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step by efficiently combining lifters.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python to determine the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\n```python\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nboxes = [110, 230, 255, 47, 133, 280, 271, 275, 155, 80, 169, 89, 299, 241, 187, 234]\nlifters = [160, 110, 114, 55, 54, 60]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    used_indices = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n    for i, capacity in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if total_capacity < box_weight:\n            used_indices.append(i)\n            total_capacity += capacity\n        if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n            break\n    if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n        return used_indices\n    return None\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in 7 steps or less\nfor step in range(7):\n    step_lifting = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    used_lifters = set()\n    \n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step_lifting.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for index in lifter_indices:\n                used_lifters.add(index)\n    \n    # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n    available_lifters = [capacity for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n    \n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift all boxes in the minimum number of steps by efficiently combining lifters.
