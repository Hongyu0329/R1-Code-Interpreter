    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 8 boxes with weights: [14, 51, 14, 69, 77, 20, 52, 96].\n   - We have 3 lifters with capacities: [69, 66, 74].\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 4 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by assigning the heaviest boxes to the available lifters, combining lifters if necessary.\n   - Use the lifters' capacities efficiently to minimize the number of steps.\n   - Ensure that all boxes are lifted within the 4-step limit.\n\n3. **Implementation:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Attempt to lift as many boxes as possible in each step by combining lifters if needed.\n   - Keep track of which boxes are lifted in each step and ensure all boxes are lifted by the end.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to determine the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [14, 51, 14, 69, 77, 20, 52, 96]\nlifters = [69, 66, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Try to find a single lifter first\n    for i, capacity in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if capacity >= box_weight:\n            return [i]\n    \n    # If no single lifter can lift the box, try combinations\n    for i in range(len(available_lifters)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(available_lifters)):\n            if available_lifters[i] + available_lifters[j] >= box_weight:\n                return [i, j]\n    \n    return []\n\n# Lift boxes in steps\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for index in lifter_indices:\n                available_lifters[index] = 0  # Mark lifter as used in this step\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will determine the optimal way to assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible.
