    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the constraints. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each box, try to assign the minimum number of lifters whose combined capacity is equal to or greater than the box's weight. This involves checking combinations of lifters.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\n5. **Optimize for Minimum Steps**: Try to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [97, 164, 187, 145, 255, 257, 240, 55, 261, 185, 252, 257, 206, 298, 121, 202]\nlifters = [131, 106, 144, 121, 109, 52]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n                for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n                    indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n                    if sum(capacities) >= box and all(not used_lifters[i] for i in indices):\n                        step.append((box, list(indices)))\n                        for i in indices:\n                            used_lifters[i] = True\n                        boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n        steps.append(step)\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):\n    print(f\"Step {i}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 7. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
