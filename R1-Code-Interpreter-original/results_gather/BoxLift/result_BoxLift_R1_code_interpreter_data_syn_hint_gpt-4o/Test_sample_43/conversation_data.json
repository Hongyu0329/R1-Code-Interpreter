    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes, and each lifter can only lift one box per step.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight, as heavier boxes are more challenging to lift and may require more lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity, as stronger lifters should be used for heavier boxes.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 9.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [247, 236, 255, 64, 58, 144, 218, 200, 320, 87, 256, 111, 379, 318, 367, 88, 136, 125, 172, 93]\nlifters = [63, 51, 130, 110, 117, 132]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        remaining_capacity = box\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if lifter <= remaining_capacity:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                remaining_capacity -= lifter\n                if remaining_capacity <= 0:\n                    break\n        if remaining_capacity <= 0:\n            # If we found a valid combination, add it to the step\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Remove the used lifters and the box\n            for i in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                del remaining_lifters[i]\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find the optimal way to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, ensuring that the constraints are respected.

If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to meet the required weight.\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 9.\n\nLet's implement this revised strategy using Python code.\n\n```python\nboxes = [247, 236, 255, 64, 58, 144, 218, 200, 320, 87, 256, 111, 379, 318, 367, 88, 136, 125, 172, 93]\nlifters = [63, 51, 130, 110, 117, 132]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_indices = []\n        remaining_capacity = box\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and lifter <= remaining_capacity:\n                used_indices.append(i)\n                remaining_capacity -= lifter\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n                if remaining_capacity <= 0:\n                    break\n        if remaining_capacity <= 0:\n            # If we found a valid combination, add it to the step\n            step.append((box, used_indices))\n            # Remove the box\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code should be more efficient and avoid the timeout issue by focusing on a greedy approach to lift the heaviest boxes first.
