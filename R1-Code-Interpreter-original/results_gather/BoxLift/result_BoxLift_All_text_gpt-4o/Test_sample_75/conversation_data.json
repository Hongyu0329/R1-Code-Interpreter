    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes, as they will require more lifters or stronger lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Match Lifters to Boxes**: Try to match the heaviest boxes with the available lifters, either individually or in combination, to lift them in the fewest steps.\n\n3. **Use Lifters Efficiently**: Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step and try to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n\n4. **Plan for Multiple Steps**: Since we have a constraint of a maximum of 3 steps, plan the distribution of boxes across these steps carefully.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given data:\n\n- **Box Weights**: [76, 97, 14, 30, 36, 83, 45, 46]\n- **Lifter Capacities**: [69, 59, 68, 50]\n\n**Step 1**:\n- The heaviest box is 97. It cannot be lifted by any single lifter, so we need to combine lifters.\n- Combine lifters 0 (69) and 2 (68) to lift the 97 box. Total capacity = 137, which is sufficient.\n- Next, the 83 box can be lifted by combining lifters 1 (59) and 3 (50). Total capacity = 109, which is sufficient.\n\n**Step 2**:\n- The next heaviest box is 76. Combine lifters 0 (69) and 3 (50) to lift it. Total capacity = 119, which is sufficient.\n- The 46 box can be lifted by lifter 2 (68) alone.\n- The 45 box can be lifted by lifter 1 (59) alone.\n\n**Step 3**:\n- The remaining boxes are 36, 30, and 14.\n- Lifter 0 (69) can lift the 36 box.\n- Lifter 2 (68) can lift the 30 box.\n- Lifter 1 (59) can lift the 14 box.\n\nNow, let's format the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(97, [0, 2]), (83, [1, 3])]\nStep 2: [(76, [0, 3]), (46, [2]), (45, [1])]\nStep 3: [(36, [0]), (30, [2]), (14, [1])]\n>>>"
