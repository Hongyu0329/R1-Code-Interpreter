    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and resources:**\n   - We have boxes with weights: [41, 69, 80, 19, 54, 85, 64, 35].\n   - Lifters have capacities: [45, 45, 62, 74].\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 4 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort boxes in descending order: [85, 80, 69, 64, 54, 41, 35, 19].\n   - Sort lifters in descending order: [74, 62, 45, 45].\n\n3. **Plan the steps:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 85: Needs multiple lifters. Use lifters 0 (74) and 2 (45) to lift it (74 + 45 = 119).\n     - Box 64: Use lifter 1 (62) and lifter 3 (45) to lift it (62 + 45 = 107).\n     - Remaining lifters: None available for this step.\n\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 80: Use lifters 0 (74) and 3 (45) to lift it (74 + 45 = 119).\n     - Box 69: Use lifters 1 (62) and 2 (45) to lift it (62 + 45 = 107).\n     - Remaining lifters: None available for this step.\n\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 54: Use lifter 0 (74) to lift it.\n     - Box 41: Use lifter 1 (62) to lift it.\n     - Box 35: Use lifter 2 (45) to lift it.\n     - Box 19: Use lifter 3 (45) to lift it.\n     - All lifters are used in this step.\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - All boxes are lifted in 3 steps, which is within the 4-step limit.\n   - Each lifter is used only once per step, and multiple lifters are combined when necessary.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(85, [0, 2]), (64, [1, 3])]\nStep 2: [(80, [0, 3]), (69, [1, 2])]\nStep 3: [(54, [0]), (41, [1]), (35, [2]), (19, [3])]\n>>>"
