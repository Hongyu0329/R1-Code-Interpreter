    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n   - Use the lifters with the highest capacities to lift the heaviest boxes.\n   - Combine lifters when necessary to lift a box that exceeds the capacity of any single lifter.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - Assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and using the strongest available lifters.\n   - Repeat the process for each step until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n**Box Weights (sorted):** [375, 374, 362, 357, 335, 334, 282, 276, 242, 236, 212, 209, 202, 201, 193, 192, 167, 158, 149, 70]\n\n**Lifter Capacities (sorted):** [186, 182, 174, 149, 130, 87, 80]\n\n**Steps:**\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 375: [186, 182, 7] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 357: [174, 182] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 334: [186, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 282: [182, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 242: [186, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 209: [182, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 202: [186, 149] (combined lifters)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 374: [186, 182, 7] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 362: [174, 182] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 335: [186, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 276: [182, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 236: [186, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 212: [182, 149] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 201: [186, 149] (combined lifters)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 192: [186, 7] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 193: [182, 7] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 167: [174, 7] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 158: [149, 7] (combined lifters)\n  - Box 149: [149] (single lifter)\n  - Box 70: [80] (single lifter)\n\nThis solution uses 3 steps, which is within the 7-step limit. Each step efficiently utilizes the available lifters to lift the heaviest possible boxes.\n\n<<<Step 1: [(375, [0, 1, 6]), (357, [2, 1]), (334, [0, 3]), (282, [1, 3]), (242, [0, 3]), (209, [1, 3]), (202, [0, 3])]\nStep 2: [(374, [0, 1, 6]), (362, [2, 1]), (335, [0, 3]), (276, [1, 3]), (236, [0, 3]), (212, [1, 3]), (201, [0, 3])]\nStep 3: [(192, [0, 6]), (193, [1, 6]), (167, [2, 6]), (158, [3, 6]), (149, [3]), (70, [4])]>>>"
