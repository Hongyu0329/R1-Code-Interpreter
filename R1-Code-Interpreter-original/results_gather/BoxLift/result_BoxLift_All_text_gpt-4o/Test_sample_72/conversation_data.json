    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps and complete the task in 8 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Analyze the lifters and boxes:**\n   - Lifters' capacities: [49, 131, 66, 124, 91]\n   - Boxes' weights: [280, 109, 195, 129, 54, 216, 157, 193, 44, 233, 171, 218, 204, 120, 131, 151]\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by trying to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are the most challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Step-by-step assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 280: Use lifters [1, 3, 4] (131 + 124 + 91 = 346)\n- Box 109: Use lifter [1] (131)\n- Box 44: Use lifter [0] (49)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 233: Use lifters [1, 3] (131 + 124 = 255)\n- Box 195: Use lifters [1, 4] (131 + 91 = 222)\n- Box 54: Use lifter [2] (66)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 218: Use lifters [1, 3] (131 + 124 = 255)\n- Box 204: Use lifters [1, 4] (131 + 91 = 222)\n- Box 44: Use lifter [0] (49)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 171: Use lifters [1, 4] (131 + 91 = 222)\n- Box 157: Use lifters [1, 3] (131 + 124 = 255)\n- Box 44: Use lifter [0] (49)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 151: Use lifters [1, 4] (131 + 91 = 222)\n- Box 129: Use lifters [1, 3] (131 + 124 = 255)\n- Box 44: Use lifter [0] (49)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 131: Use lifter [1] (131)\n- Box 120: Use lifter [3] (124)\n- Box 44: Use lifter [0] (49)\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 193: Use lifters [1, 3] (131 + 124 = 255)\n- Box 44: Use lifter [0] (49)\n\n**Step 8:**\n- Box 44: Use lifter [0] (49)\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 8 steps or fewer, using the lifters efficiently.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(280, [1, 3, 4]), (109, [1]), (44, [0])]\nStep 2: [(233, [1, 3]), (195, [1, 4]), (54, [2])]\nStep 3: [(218, [1, 3]), (204, [1, 4]), (44, [0])]\nStep 4: [(171, [1, 4]), (157, [1, 3]), (44, [0])]\nStep 5: [(151, [1, 4]), (129, [1, 3]), (44, [0])]\nStep 6: [(131, [1]), (120, [3]), (44, [0])]\nStep 7: [(193, [1, 3]), (44, [0])]\nStep 8: [(44, [0])]\n>>>"
