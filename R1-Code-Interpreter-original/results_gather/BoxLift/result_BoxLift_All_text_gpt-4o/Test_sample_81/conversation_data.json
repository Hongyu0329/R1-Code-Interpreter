    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 4 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 5 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Box Weights and Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [174, 117, 74, 120, 98, 65, 112, 61, 46, 87, 176, 110]\n   - Lifter capacities: [119, 104, 67, 98]\n\n3. **Plan the Lifting Strategy:**\n   - Start by matching the heaviest boxes with combinations of lifters that can lift them.\n   - Use the lifters efficiently by trying to lift as many boxes as possible in each step.\n   - Prioritize lifting heavier boxes first to ensure they are lifted within the step limit.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n   **Step 1:**\n   - Box 174: Needs lifters 0 (119) and 1 (104) combined (total 223).\n   - Box 117: Lifter 0 (119) can lift alone.\n   - Box 74: Lifter 2 (67) and 3 (98) combined (total 165).\n   - Box 120: Lifter 0 (119) and 3 (98) combined (total 217).\n\n   **Step 2:**\n   - Box 98: Lifter 3 (98) can lift alone.\n   - Box 65: Lifter 2 (67) can lift alone.\n   - Box 112: Lifter 0 (119) can lift alone.\n   - Box 61: Lifter 2 (67) can lift alone.\n\n   **Step 3:**\n   - Box 46: Lifter 2 (67) can lift alone.\n   - Box 87: Lifter 3 (98) can lift alone.\n   - Box 176: Needs lifters 0 (119) and 1 (104) combined (total 223).\n   - Box 110: Lifter 0 (119) can lift alone.\n\n5. **Ensure All Boxes Are Lifted:**\n   - Verify that all boxes are accounted for in the steps.\n   - Ensure no step exceeds the lifter's capacity or the number of lifters available.\n\n6. **Output the Solution:**\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(174, [0, 1]), (117, [0]), (74, [2, 3]), (120, [0, 3])]\nStep 2: [(98, [3]), (65, [2]), (112, [0]), (61, [2])]\nStep 3: [(46, [2]), (87, [3]), (176, [0, 1]), (110, [0])]\n>>>"
