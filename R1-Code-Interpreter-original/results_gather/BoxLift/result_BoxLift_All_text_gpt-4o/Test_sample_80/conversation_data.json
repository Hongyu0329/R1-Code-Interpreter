    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: The heaviest boxes are 75, 73, 64, and 59. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**: The lifters have capacities of 74, 57, and 51. No single lifter can lift the heaviest boxes alone.\n\n3. **Combine Lifters for Heaviest Boxes**: \n   - The heaviest box is 75. We can combine lifters with capacities 74 and 51 to lift it (74 + 51 = 125, which is more than enough).\n   - The next heaviest box is 73. We can use the same combination of lifters (74 and 51) to lift it.\n   - The box weighing 64 can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 57 and 51 (57 + 51 = 108).\n   - The box weighing 59 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 74 alone.\n\n4. **Assign Remaining Boxes**: \n   - The box weighing 58 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 74.\n   - The box weighing 47 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 57.\n   - The box weighing 14 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 51.\n   - The box weighing 13 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 51.\n\n5. **Plan Steps**: We need to ensure all boxes are lifted in 4 steps or fewer.\n\nLet's organize the steps:\n\n- **Step 1**:\n  - Lift box 75 using lifters [0, 2] (74 + 51).\n  - Lift box 59 using lifter [0] (74).\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Lift box 73 using lifters [0, 2] (74 + 51).\n  - Lift box 58 using lifter [0] (74).\n\n- **Step 3**:\n  - Lift box 64 using lifters [1, 2] (57 + 51).\n  - Lift box 47 using lifter [1] (57).\n\n- **Step 4**:\n  - Lift box 14 using lifter [2] (51).\n  - Lift box 13 using lifter [2] (51).\n\nThis plan ensures all boxes are lifted in 4 steps, adhering to the rules and using the minimum number of steps possible.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(75, [0, 2]), (59, [0])]\nStep 2: [(73, [0, 2]), (58, [0])]\nStep 3: [(64, [1, 2]), (47, [1])]\nStep 4: [(14, [2]), (13, [2])]\n>>>"
