    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 5 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 10 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy for Solution:**\n   - Start by attempting to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are the most restrictive in terms of lifter combinations.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that are too heavy for a single lifter.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n   - Aim to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 292: Use lifters [0, 2, 3] (115 + 142 + 79 = 336)\n     - Box 257: Use lifters [1, 4] (55 + 63 = 118)\n     - Box 238: Use lifters [0, 2] (115 + 142 = 257)\n     - Box 243: Use lifters [0, 3] (115 + 79 = 194)\n     - Box 239: Use lifters [2, 3] (142 + 79 = 221)\n\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 229: Use lifters [0, 2] (115 + 142 = 257)\n     - Box 202: Use lifters [0, 3] (115 + 79 = 194)\n     - Box 197: Use lifters [2, 3] (142 + 79 = 221)\n     - Box 187: Use lifters [0, 2] (115 + 142 = 257)\n     - Box 170: Use lifters [0, 3] (115 + 79 = 194)\n\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 168: Use lifters [0, 2] (115 + 142 = 257)\n     - Box 125: Use lifters [0, 3] (115 + 79 = 194)\n     - Box 110: Use lifter [0] (115)\n     - Box 50: Use lifter [1] (55)\n     - Box 48: Use lifter [1] (55)\n     - Box 42: Use lifter [1] (55)\n\n4. **Final Assignment:**\n   - Ensure that all boxes are lifted and that the solution is efficient.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(292, [0, 2, 3]), (257, [1, 4]), (238, [0, 2]), (243, [0, 3]), (239, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(229, [0, 2]), (202, [0, 3]), (197, [2, 3]), (187, [0, 2]), (170, [0, 3])]\nStep 3: [(168, [0, 2]), (125, [0, 3]), (110, [0]), (50, [1]), (48, [1]), (42, [1])]\n>>>"
