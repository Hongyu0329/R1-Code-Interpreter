    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and rules:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps and complete the task in 6 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n3. **Assign lifters to boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and assign the strongest available lifters.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Repeat the process for each box, ensuring that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Plan the steps:**\n   - In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by efficiently using the available lifters.\n   - Keep track of which lifters are used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n5. **Iterate until all boxes are lifted:**\n   - Continue assigning lifters to boxes in subsequent steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n- **Boxes (sorted):** [195, 187, 165, 140, 97, 95, 92, 85, 38, 37, 25, 21]\n- **Lifters (sorted):** [96, 88, 48, 32]\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 195: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (96 + 88 + 48 = 232)\n  - Box 32: Lifter [3]\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 187: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (96 + 88 + 48 = 232)\n  - Box 21: Lifter [3]\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 165: Lifters [0, 1] (96 + 88 = 184)\n  - Box 37: Lifter [2]\n  - Box 25: Lifter [3]\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 140: Lifters [0, 1] (96 + 88 = 184)\n  - Box 38: Lifter [2]\n  - Box 85: Lifter [3]\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 97: Lifters [0, 1] (96 + 88 = 184)\n  - Box 95: Lifters [2, 3] (48 + 32 = 80, but need to combine with another lifter, so use [2, 3, 0] for 176)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 92: Lifters [0, 1] (96 + 88 = 184)\n\nThis solution uses 6 steps, which is within the allowed limit.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(195, [0, 1, 2]), (32, [3])]\nStep 2: [(187, [0, 1, 2]), (21, [3])]\nStep 3: [(165, [0, 1]), (37, [2]), (25, [3])]\nStep 4: [(140, [0, 1]), (38, [2]), (85, [3])]\nStep 5: [(97, [0, 1]), (95, [2, 3, 0])]\nStep 6: [(92, [0, 1])]\n>>>"
