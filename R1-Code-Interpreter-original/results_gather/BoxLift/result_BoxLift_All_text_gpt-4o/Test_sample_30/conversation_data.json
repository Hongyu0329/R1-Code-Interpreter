    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: \n   - The heaviest boxes are 96, 77, and 69. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**:\n   - The lifters have capacities of 69, 66, and 74. \n\n3. **Plan the Steps**:\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 4 steps or fewer, using the minimum number of steps possible.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment**:\n   - **Step 1**: \n     - The heaviest box is 96. It requires at least two lifters. We can use lifters with capacities 74 and 69 to lift it together (74 + 69 = 143, which is more than 96).\n     - The next heaviest box is 77. The remaining lifter with a capacity of 66 can lift it with the help of the lifter with capacity 69 (66 + 69 = 135, which is more than 77).\n     - Assign: [(96, [0, 2]), (77, [1, 0])]\n\n   - **Step 2**:\n     - The next heaviest box is 69. A single lifter with a capacity of 74 can lift it.\n     - The next box is 52. A single lifter with a capacity of 66 can lift it.\n     - The next box is 51. A single lifter with a capacity of 69 can lift it.\n     - Assign: [(69, [2]), (52, [1]), (51, [0])]\n\n   - **Step 3**:\n     - The remaining boxes are 20 and two boxes of 14.\n     - A single lifter with a capacity of 69 can lift the box weighing 20.\n     - The two boxes weighing 14 can be lifted by the remaining two lifters with capacities 66 and 74.\n     - Assign: [(20, [0]), (14, [1]), (14, [2])]\n\n5. **Verify**:\n   - All boxes are lifted in 3 steps, which is within the 4-step limit.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(96, [0, 2]), (77, [1, 0])]\nStep 2: [(69, [2]), (52, [1]), (51, [0])]\nStep 3: [(20, [0]), (14, [1]), (14, [2])]\n>>>"
