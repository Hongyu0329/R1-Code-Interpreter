    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and require more lifters.\n   - Use the maximum capacity of lifters efficiently by combining them to lift heavier boxes.\n   - Ensure that each step uses the available lifters optimally.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - Start assigning lifters to boxes from the heaviest to the lightest, ensuring that the total capacity of the assigned lifters meets or exceeds the box weight.\n\n4. **Assignment:**\n   - We will go through each step and assign lifters to boxes, ensuring that we use the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's proceed with the assignment:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 399: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3] (140 + 115 + 159 + 147 = 561)\n- Box 386: [Lifters 4, 5] (129 + 112 = 241)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 370: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (140 + 115 + 159 = 414)\n- Box 351: [Lifters 3, 4] (147 + 129 = 276)\n- Box 44: [Lifter 5] (112)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 337: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (140 + 115 + 159 = 414)\n- Box 333: [Lifters 3, 4] (147 + 129 = 276)\n- Box 77: [Lifter 5] (112)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 314: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (140 + 115 + 159 = 414)\n- Box 266: [Lifters 3, 4] (147 + 129 = 276)\n- Box 113: [Lifter 5] (112)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 238: [Lifters 0, 1] (140 + 115 = 255)\n- Box 200: [Lifters 2, 3] (159 + 147 = 306)\n- Box 193: [Lifters 4, 5] (129 + 112 = 241)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 181: [Lifters 0, 1] (140 + 115 = 255)\n- Box 175: [Lifters 2, 3] (159 + 147 = 306)\n- Box 134: [Lifters 4, 5] (129 + 112 = 241)\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 118: [Lifters 0, 1] (140 + 115 = 255)\n- Box 70: [Lifter 2] (159)\n- Box 64: [Lifter 3] (147)\n\nThis assignment ensures that all boxes are lifted in 7 steps or fewer, using the lifters efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<\nStep 1: [(399, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (386, [4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(370, [0, 1, 2]), (351, [3, 4]), (44, [5])]\nStep 3: [(337, [0, 1, 2]), (333, [3, 4]), (77, [5])]\nStep 4: [(314, [0, 1, 2]), (266, [3, 4]), (113, [5])]\nStep 5: [(238, [0, 1]), (200, [2, 3]), (193, [4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(181, [0, 1]), (175, [2, 3]), (134, [4, 5])]\nStep 7: [(118, [0, 1]), (70, [2]), (64, [3])]\n>>>"
