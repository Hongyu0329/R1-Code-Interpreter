    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy for Solution:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n   - Aim to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n   - **Step 1:** Focus on the heaviest boxes.\n     - Box 397: Use lifters [0, 5, 6] (155 + 156 + 167 = 478)\n     - Box 356: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 328: Use lifters [0, 6] (155 + 167 = 322)\n     - Box 315: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 292: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n   - **Step 2:** Continue with the next heaviest boxes.\n     - Box 254: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 240: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 236: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 231: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 223: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n   - **Step 3:** Continue with the next heaviest boxes.\n     - Box 216: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 203: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 200: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 178: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n     - Box 175: Use lifters [0, 5] (155 + 156 = 311)\n   - **Step 4:** Continue with the next heaviest boxes.\n     - Box 155: Use lifter [0] (155)\n     - Box 142: Use lifters [0, 1] (155 + 116 = 271)\n     - Box 131: Use lifters [0, 1] (155 + 116 = 271)\n     - Box 80: Use lifter [0] (155)\n     - Box 44: Use lifter [0] (155)\n\n4. **Final Assignment:**\n   - Ensure that all boxes are lifted within the constraints and steps.\n\nHere is the final solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(397, [0, 5, 6]), (356, [0, 5]), (328, [0, 6]), (315, [0, 5]), (292, [0, 5])]\nStep 2: [(254, [0, 5]), (240, [0, 5]), (236, [0, 5]), (231, [0, 5]), (223, [0, 5])]\nStep 3: [(216, [0, 5]), (203, [0, 5]), (200, [0, 5]), (178, [0, 5]), (175, [0, 5])]\nStep 4: [(155, [0]), (142, [0, 1]), (131, [0, 1]), (80, [0]), (44, [0])]\n>>>"
