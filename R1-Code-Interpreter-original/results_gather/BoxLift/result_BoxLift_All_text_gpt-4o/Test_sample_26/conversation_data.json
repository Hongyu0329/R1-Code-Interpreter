    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and requirements:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with weights: [58, 45, 94, 26, 49, 153, 61, 23, 170, 143, 75, 166].\n   - We have 5 lifters with capacities: [57, 61, 104, 98, 70].\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 4 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting heavier boxes first: [170, 166, 153, 143, 94, 75, 61, 58, 49, 45, 26, 23].\n   - Sort lifters in descending order of capacity: [104, 98, 70, 61, 57].\n\n3. **Plan the steps:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 170: Needs multiple lifters. Use lifters 0 (104) and 1 (98) to lift it (total 202).\n     - Box 166: Use lifters 2 (70) and 3 (61) to lift it (total 131), and add lifter 4 (57) to reach 188.\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 153: Use lifters 0 (104) and 1 (98) to lift it (total 202).\n     - Box 143: Use lifters 2 (70) and 3 (61) to lift it (total 131), and add lifter 4 (57) to reach 188.\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 94: Use lifter 0 (104).\n     - Box 75: Use lifter 1 (98).\n     - Box 61: Use lifter 2 (70).\n     - Box 58: Use lifter 3 (61).\n     - Box 49: Use lifter 4 (57).\n   - **Step 4:**\n     - Box 45: Use lifter 0 (104).\n     - Box 26: Use lifter 1 (98).\n     - Box 23: Use lifter 2 (70).\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted.\n   - Ensure no lifter exceeds their capacity.\n   - Ensure the solution is within 4 steps.\n\nHere is the final solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(170, [0, 1]), (166, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(153, [0, 1]), (143, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(94, [0]), (75, [1]), (61, [2]), (58, [3]), (49, [4])]\nStep 4: [(45, [0]), (26, [1]), (23, [2])]\n>>>"
