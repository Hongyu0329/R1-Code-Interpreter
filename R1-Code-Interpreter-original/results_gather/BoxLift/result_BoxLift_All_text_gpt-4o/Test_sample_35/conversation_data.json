    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: \n   - The heaviest boxes are 85 and 82. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify the Lifting Capacities**:\n   - The lifters have capacities of 63, 48, 72, and 68.\n\n3. **Plan for the Heaviest Boxes**:\n   - Box 85: Needs at least two lifters. The best combination is lifters with capacities 72 and 68, totaling 140.\n   - Box 82: Needs at least two lifters. The best combination is lifters with capacities 63 and 48, totaling 111.\n\n4. **Plan for Remaining Boxes**:\n   - After lifting the heaviest boxes, we need to lift the remaining boxes in the fewest steps possible.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Assignment**:\n\n   **Step 1**:\n   - Lift Box 85 using lifters with capacities 72 and 68. (Lifter indices 2 and 3)\n   - Lift Box 82 using lifters with capacities 63 and 48. (Lifter indices 0 and 1)\n\n   **Step 2**:\n   - Now, we have the following boxes left: 16, 56, 15, 12, 12, 32.\n   - Assign lifters to the heaviest remaining boxes:\n     - Lift Box 56 using lifter with capacity 63. (Lifter index 0)\n     - Lift Box 32 using lifter with capacity 48. (Lifter index 1)\n     - Lift Box 16 using lifter with capacity 68. (Lifter index 3)\n     - Lift Box 15 using lifter with capacity 72. (Lifter index 2)\n\n   **Step 3**:\n   - Remaining boxes are 12 and 12.\n   - Lift Box 12 using lifter with capacity 63. (Lifter index 0)\n   - Lift Box 12 using lifter with capacity 48. (Lifter index 1)\n\n6. **Final Assignment**:\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted within 3 steps.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(85, [2, 3]), (82, [0, 1])]\nStep 2: [(56, [0]), (32, [1]), (16, [3]), (15, [2])]\nStep 3: [(12, [0]), (12, [1])]\n>>>"
