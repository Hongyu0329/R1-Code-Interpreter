    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints and rules provided, such as the maximum lifting capacity of each lifter and the ability to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes, as they will require more lifters to lift. This will help in planning the allocation of lifters efficiently.\n\n2. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Sort the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of their lifting capacities. This will help in matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: Begin assigning lifters to boxes starting from the heaviest box. Use the strongest available lifters or combinations of lifters to lift each box. Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Repeat for Remaining Boxes**: Continue the process for the remaining boxes, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps.\n\n5. **Check Step Limit**: Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 11.\n\nNow, let's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n- **Boxes**: [295, 283, 255, 250, 246, 245, 215, 153, 149, 148, 145, 114, 113, 62, 50, 48]\n- **Lifters**: [159, 88, 82, 56, 55]\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Step 1**:\n- Box 295: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (159 + 88 + 82 = 329)\n- Box 283: [Lifters 3, 4] (56 + 55 = 111, not enough, so adjust)\n- Adjust: Box 283: [Lifters 0, 1, 3] (159 + 88 + 56 = 303)\n\n**Step 2**:\n- Box 255: [Lifters 0, 1] (159 + 88 = 247, not enough, so adjust)\n- Adjust: Box 255: [Lifters 0, 2, 3] (159 + 82 + 56 = 297)\n- Box 250: [Lifters 1, 4] (88 + 55 = 143, not enough, so adjust)\n- Adjust: Box 250: [Lifters 0, 1, 4] (159 + 88 + 55 = 302)\n\n**Step 3**:\n- Box 246: [Lifters 0, 1] (159 + 88 = 247)\n- Box 245: [Lifters 2, 3, 4] (82 + 56 + 55 = 193, not enough, so adjust)\n- Adjust: Box 245: [Lifters 0, 2, 4] (159 + 82 + 55 = 296)\n\n**Step 4**:\n- Box 215: [Lifters 0, 1] (159 + 88 = 247)\n- Box 153: [Lifter 0] (159)\n\n**Step 5**:\n- Box 149: [Lifter 0] (159)\n- Box 148: [Lifter 0] (159)\n\n**Step 6**:\n- Box 145: [Lifter 0] (159)\n- Box 114: [Lifter 0] (159)\n\n**Step 7**:\n- Box 113: [Lifter 0] (159)\n- Box 62: [Lifter 0] (159)\n\n**Step 8**:\n- Box 50: [Lifter 0] (159)\n- Box 48: [Lifter 0] (159)\n\nThis solution uses 8 steps, which is within the 11-step limit. Each step efficiently utilizes the lifters to lift the heaviest possible boxes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(295, [0, 1, 2]), (283, [0, 1, 3])]\nStep 2: [(255, [0, 2, 3]), (250, [0, 1, 4])]\nStep 3: [(246, [0, 1]), (245, [0, 2, 4])]\nStep 4: [(215, [0, 1]), (153, [0])]\nStep 5: [(149, [0]), (148, [0])]\nStep 6: [(145, [0]), (114, [0])]\nStep 7: [(113, [0]), (62, [0])]\nStep 8: [(50, [0]), (48, [0])]\n>>>"
