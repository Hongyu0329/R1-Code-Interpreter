    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 4 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a box if needed.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 5 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Box Weights and Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [88, 128, 39, 30, 80, 60, 162, 154, 191, 150, 178, 32]\n   - Lifter capacities: [95, 111, 115, 35]\n\n3. **Plan the Lifting Strategy:**\n   - Start by matching the heaviest boxes with combinations of lifters that can lift them.\n   - Use individual lifters for boxes they can lift alone to maximize efficiency.\n   - Ensure that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps.\n\n4. **Execute the Plan:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 191: Needs lifters 0, 1, and 2 (95 + 111 + 115 = 321, more than enough).\n     - Box 32: Lifter 3 can lift alone.\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 178: Needs lifters 0, 1, and 2 (95 + 111 + 115 = 321, more than enough).\n     - Box 30: Lifter 3 can lift alone.\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 162: Needs lifters 0 and 1 (95 + 111 = 206, more than enough).\n     - Box 39: Lifter 2 can lift alone.\n     - Box 60: Lifter 3 can lift alone.\n   - **Step 4:**\n     - Box 154: Needs lifters 0 and 1 (95 + 111 = 206, more than enough).\n     - Box 80: Lifter 2 can lift alone.\n     - Box 88: Lifter 3 can lift alone.\n   - **Step 5:**\n     - Box 150: Needs lifters 0 and 1 (95 + 111 = 206, more than enough).\n     - Box 128: Needs lifters 2 and 3 (115 + 35 = 150, more than enough).\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - All boxes are lifted within 5 steps.\n   - Each lifter is used only once per step.\n   - The solution adheres to all given rules.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(191, [0, 1, 2]), (32, [3])]\nStep 2: [(178, [0, 1, 2]), (30, [3])]\nStep 3: [(162, [0, 1]), (39, [2]), (60, [3])]\nStep 4: [(154, [0, 1]), (80, [2]), (88, [3])]\nStep 5: [(150, [0, 1]), (128, [2, 3])]\n>>>"
