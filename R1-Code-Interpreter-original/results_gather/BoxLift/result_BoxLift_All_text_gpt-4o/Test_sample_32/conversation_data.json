    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 5 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 11 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - For each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first using available lifters.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that are too heavy for a single lifter.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - We will iterate through the sorted list of boxes and assign lifters to each box, ensuring that we use the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 268: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209, not enough, so we need all lifters: 77 + 41 + 40 + 54 + 132 = 344)\n  - Box 257: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209, not enough, so we need all lifters: 77 + 41 + 40 + 54 + 132 = 344)\n  - Box 242: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209, not enough, so we need all lifters: 77 + 41 + 40 + 54 + 132 = 344)\n  - Box 242: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209, not enough, so we need all lifters: 77 + 41 + 40 + 54 + 132 = 344)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 237: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209, not enough, so we need all lifters: 77 + 41 + 40 + 54 + 132 = 344)\n  - Box 214: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209, not enough, so we need all lifters: 77 + 41 + 40 + 54 + 132 = 344)\n  - Box 204: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209, not enough, so we need all lifters: 77 + 41 + 40 + 54 + 132 = 344)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 194: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209)\n  - Box 186: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209)\n  - Box 157: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 135: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209)\n  - Box 115: Use lifters [0, 4] (77 + 132 = 209)\n  - Box 83: Use lifters [0, 1] (77 + 41 = 118)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 72: Use lifters [0, 1] (77 + 41 = 118)\n  - Box 47: Use lifter [0] (77)\n  - Box 41: Use lifter [1] (41)\n\nThis solution uses 5 steps, which is within the 11-step limit. Each step is optimized to lift the heaviest possible boxes with the available lifters.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(268, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), (257, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), (242, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), (242, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(237, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), (214, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), (204, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(194, [0, 4]), (186, [0, 4]), (157, [0, 4])]\nStep 4: [(135, [0, 4]), (115, [0, 4]), (83, [0, 1])]\nStep 5: [(72, [0, 1]), (47, [0]), (41, [1])]\n>>>"
