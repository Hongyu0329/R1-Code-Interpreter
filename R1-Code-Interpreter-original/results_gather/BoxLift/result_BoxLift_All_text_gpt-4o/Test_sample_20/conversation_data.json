    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: The heaviest boxes are 73, 67, and 65. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**: The lifters have capacities of 66, 72, and 43. The lifter with a capacity of 72 can lift most boxes alone except for the heaviest ones.\n\n3. **Combine Lifters for Heaviest Boxes**: \n   - The box weighing 73 can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 72 and 43.\n   - The box weighing 67 can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 66 and 43.\n   - The box weighing 65 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 72 alone.\n\n4. **Assign Remaining Boxes**: \n   - The box weighing 60 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 66.\n   - The box weighing 31 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 43.\n   - The box weighing 30 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 43.\n   - The box weighing 27 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 43.\n   - The box weighing 18 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 43.\n\n5. **Plan Steps**: \n   - In each step, we need to ensure that each lifter is used only once and that we lift as many boxes as possible.\n\nLet's organize the steps:\n\n**Step 1**:\n- Lift box 73 using lifters 0 (72) and 2 (43).\n- Lift box 60 using lifter 1 (66).\n\n**Step 2**:\n- Lift box 67 using lifters 0 (72) and 2 (43).\n- Lift box 31 using lifter 1 (66).\n\n**Step 3**:\n- Lift box 65 using lifter 0 (72).\n- Lift box 30 using lifter 1 (66).\n- Lift box 18 using lifter 2 (43).\n\n**Step 4**:\n- Lift box 27 using lifter 1 (66).\n\nThis plan uses all lifters efficiently and completes the task in 4 steps, which is the maximum allowed.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(73, [0, 2]), (60, [1])]\nStep 2: [(67, [0, 2]), (31, [1])]\nStep 3: [(65, [0]), (30, [1]), (18, [2])]\nStep 4: [(27, [1])]\n>>>"
