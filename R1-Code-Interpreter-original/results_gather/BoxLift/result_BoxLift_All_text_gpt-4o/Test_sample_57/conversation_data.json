    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n\n3. **Assign lifters to boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the fewest number of lifters needed to lift it.\n   - Continue assigning lifters to the next heaviest box that can be lifted with the remaining available lifters in the current step.\n   - If a box cannot be lifted in the current step due to insufficient lifter capacity, move to the next step.\n\n4. **Repeat the process for each step:**\n   - Ensure that all boxes are lifted within the 6-step limit.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n- **Box weights (sorted):** [289, 286, 252, 244, 235, 181, 174, 140, 136, 136, 92, 92, 80, 61, 35, 34]\n- **Lifter capacities (sorted):** [150, 96, 91, 61, 60, 58]\n\n**Step-by-step assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 289: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (150 + 96 + 91 = 337)\n- Box 61: Lifter [3] (61)\n- Box 58: Lifter [5] (58)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 286: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (150 + 96 + 91 = 337)\n- Box 60: Lifter [4] (60)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 252: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (150 + 96 + 91 = 337)\n- Box 35: Lifter [3] (61)\n- Box 34: Lifter [5] (58)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 244: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (150 + 96 + 91 = 337)\n- Box 92: Lifters [3, 4] (61 + 60 = 121)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 235: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (150 + 96 + 91 = 337)\n- Box 92: Lifters [3, 4] (61 + 60 = 121)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 181: Lifters [0, 1] (150 + 96 = 246)\n- Box 174: Lifters [2, 3] (91 + 61 = 152)\n- Box 140: Lifters [4, 5] (60 + 58 = 118)\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 136: Lifters [0, 1] (150 + 96 = 246)\n- Box 136: Lifters [2, 3] (91 + 61 = 152)\n- Box 80: Lifter [4] (60)\n\nThis solution uses 7 steps, which exceeds the 6-step limit.
