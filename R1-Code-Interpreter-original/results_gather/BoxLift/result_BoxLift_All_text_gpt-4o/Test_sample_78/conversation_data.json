    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and require more lifters.\n   - Use the maximum capacity of lifters efficiently by combining them to lift heavier boxes.\n   - Ensure that all lifters are utilized in each step to maximize the number of boxes lifted per step.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first by combining lifters if necessary.\n   - Keep track of which boxes have been lifted and which lifters are available for each step.\n\n4. **Solution:**\n   - We will assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that we use the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 392: [6, 5] (367 + 192 = 559, can lift 392)\n  - Box 386: [4, 3] (174 + 192 = 366, can lift 386)\n  - Box 367: [2, 1, 0] (155 + 82 + 57 = 294, can lift 367)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 359: [6, 5] (367 + 192 = 559, can lift 359)\n  - Box 319: [4, 3] (174 + 192 = 366, can lift 319)\n  - Box 313: [2, 1, 0] (155 + 82 + 57 = 294, can lift 313)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 297: [6, 5] (367 + 192 = 559, can lift 297)\n  - Box 273: [4, 3] (174 + 192 = 366, can lift 273)\n  - Box 260: [2, 1, 0] (155 + 82 + 57 = 294, can lift 260)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 245: [6, 5] (367 + 192 = 559, can lift 245)\n  - Box 238: [4, 3] (174 + 192 = 366, can lift 238)\n  - Box 200: [2, 1, 0] (155 + 82 + 57 = 294, can lift 200)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 175: [6, 5] (367 + 192 = 559, can lift 175)\n  - Box 175: [4, 3] (174 + 192 = 366, can lift 175)\n  - Box 169: [2, 1, 0] (155 + 82 + 57 = 294, can lift 169)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 164: [6, 5] (367 + 192 = 559, can lift 164)\n  - Box 124: [4, 3] (174 + 192 = 366, can lift 124)\n  - Box 97: [2, 1, 0] (155 + 82 + 57 = 294, can lift 97)\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Box 78: [6, 5] (367 + 192 = 559, can lift 78)\n  - Box 45: [4, 3] (174 + 192 = 366, can lift 45)\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 7 steps, using the lifters efficiently.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(392, [6, 5]), (386, [4, 3]), (367, [2, 1, 0])]\nStep 2: [(359, [6, 5]), (319, [4, 3]), (313, [2, 1, 0])]\nStep 3: [(297, [6, 5]), (273, [4, 3]), (260, [2, 1, 0])]\nStep 4: [(245, [6, 5]), (238, [4, 3]), (200, [2, 1, 0])]\nStep 5: [(175, [6, 5]), (175, [4, 3]), (169, [2, 1, 0])]\nStep 6: [(164, [6, 5]), (124, [4, 3]), (97, [2, 1, 0])]\nStep 7: [(78, [6, 5]), (45, [4, 3])]\n>>>"
