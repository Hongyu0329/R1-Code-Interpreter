    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 5 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Lifter capacities: [123, 155, 65, 92, 92]\n   - The strongest lifter can lift 155, and the weakest can lift 65.\n\n3. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters:**\n   - Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting heavier boxes first.\n   - Sort lifters in descending order to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n4. **Plan the Lifting Steps:**\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes possible using the available lifters.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that are too heavy for a single lifter.\n\n5. **Execute the Plan:**\n   - Assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 299: Use lifters [1, 0] (155 + 123 = 278, need 299, so add lifter 2 with 65)\n- Box 245: Use lifters [1, 3] (155 + 92 = 247)\n- Box 224: Use lifters [0, 4] (123 + 92 = 215, need 224, so add lifter 2 with 65)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 217: Use lifters [1, 0] (155 + 123 = 278)\n- Box 204: Use lifters [1, 3] (155 + 92 = 247)\n- Box 193: Use lifters [0, 4] (123 + 92 = 215)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 133: Use lifter [1] (155)\n- Box 117: Use lifter [0] (123)\n- Box 90: Use lifter [3] (92)\n- Box 92: Use lifter [4] (92)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 84: Use lifter [1] (155)\n- Box 71: Use lifter [0] (123)\n- Box 66: Use lifter [3] (92)\n- Box 62: Use lifter [4] (92)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 57: Use lifter [1] (155)\n- Box 52: Use lifter [0] (123)\n- Box 51: Use lifter [3] (92)\n\nThis plan uses 5 steps, which is within the 6-step limit. Each step efficiently utilizes the lifters to lift the maximum possible weight.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(299, [1, 0, 2]), (245, [1, 3]), (224, [0, 4])]\nStep 2: [(217, [1, 0]), (204, [1, 3]), (193, [0, 4])]\nStep 3: [(133, [1]), (117, [0]), (90, [3]), (92, [4])]\nStep 4: [(84, [1]), (71, [0]), (66, [3]), (62, [4])]\nStep 5: [(57, [1]), (52, [0]), (51, [3])]\n>>>"
