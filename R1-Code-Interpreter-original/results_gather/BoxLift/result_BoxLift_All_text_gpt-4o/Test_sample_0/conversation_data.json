    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - We have boxes with weights: [18, 93, 23, 70, 72, 22, 96, 96].\n   - Lifters have capacities: [60, 46, 61].\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 5 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting heavier boxes first: [96, 96, 93, 72, 70, 23, 22, 18].\n   - Sort lifters in descending order of capacity: [61, 60, 46].\n\n3. **Plan the steps:**\n   - **Step 1:** Focus on the heaviest boxes.\n     - Box 96: Use lifters 0 (61) and 1 (60) to lift it (total capacity 121).\n     - Box 96: Use lifter 2 (46) and one of the lifters from the previous box (e.g., lifter 1) to lift it (total capacity 106).\n   - **Step 2:** Continue with the next heaviest boxes.\n     - Box 93: Use lifters 0 (61) and 1 (60) to lift it (total capacity 121).\n     - Box 72: Use lifter 2 (46) and one of the lifters from the previous box (e.g., lifter 1) to lift it (total capacity 106).\n   - **Step 3:** Lift the remaining boxes.\n     - Box 70: Use lifters 0 (61) and 1 (60) to lift it (total capacity 121).\n     - Box 23: Use lifter 2 (46) to lift it.\n   - **Step 4:** Lift the remaining boxes.\n     - Box 22: Use lifter 0 (61) to lift it.\n     - Box 18: Use lifter 1 (60) to lift it.\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted.\n   - Ensure the number of steps is minimized and within the limit.\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(96, [0, 1]), (96, [1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(93, [0, 1]), (72, [1, 2])]\nStep 3: [(70, [0, 1]), (23, [2])]\nStep 4: [(22, [0]), (18, [1])]\n>>>"
