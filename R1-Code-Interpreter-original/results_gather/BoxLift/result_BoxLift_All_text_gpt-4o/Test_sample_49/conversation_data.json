    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps and complete the task in 8 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the fewest number of lifters needed to lift it.\n   - Use the strongest available lifters first to minimize the number of lifters used per box.\n   - Once a lifter is used in a step, they cannot be used again in the same step.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Steps:**\n   - For each step, assign lifters to as many boxes as possible.\n   - Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Check the Number of Steps:**\n   - Ensure the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nNow, let's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 396: [6, 5, 1] (Lifters 6, 5, and 1 combine to lift)\n- Box 390: [4, 3, 2] (Lifters 4, 3, and 2 combine to lift)\n- Box 386: [0] (Lifter 0 lifts alone)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 365: [6, 5, 0] (Lifters 6, 5, and 0 combine to lift)\n- Box 363: [4, 3, 1] (Lifters 4, 3, and 1 combine to lift)\n- Box 351: [2] (Lifter 2 lifts alone)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 332: [6, 5, 0] (Lifters 6, 5, and 0 combine to lift)\n- Box 319: [4, 3, 1] (Lifters 4, 3, and 1 combine to lift)\n- Box 310: [2] (Lifter 2 lifts alone)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 305: [6, 5, 0] (Lifters 6, 5, and 0 combine to lift)\n- Box 295: [4, 3, 1] (Lifters 4, 3, and 1 combine to lift)\n- Box 288: [2] (Lifter 2 lifts alone)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 283: [6, 5, 0] (Lifters 6, 5, and 0 combine to lift)\n- Box 271: [4, 3, 1] (Lifters 4, 3, and 1 combine to lift)\n- Box 221: [2] (Lifter 2 lifts alone)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 219: [6, 5, 0] (Lifters 6, 5, and 0 combine to lift)\n- Box 211: [4, 3, 1] (Lifters 4, 3, and 1 combine to lift)\n- Box 200: [2] (Lifter 2 lifts alone)\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 136: [6, 5] (Lifters 6 and 5 combine to lift)\n- Box 130: [4, 3] (Lifters 4 and 3 combine to lift)\n- Box 78: [1] (Lifter 1 lifts alone)\n- Box 68: [0] (Lifter 0 lifts alone)\n\n**Step 8:**\n- Box 64: [6] (Lifter 6 lifts alone)\n- Box 56: [5] (Lifter 5 lifts alone)\n\nThis solution uses exactly 8 steps, which is the maximum allowed, and ensures all boxes are lifted.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<\nStep 1: [(396, [6, 5, 1]), (390, [4, 3, 2]), (386, [0])]\nStep 2: [(365, [6, 5, 0]), (363, [4, 3, 1]), (351, [2])]\nStep 3: [(332, [6, 5, 0]), (319, [4, 3, 1]), (310, [2])]\nStep 4: [(305, [6, 5, 0]), (295, [4, 3, 1]), (288, [2])]\nStep 5: [(283, [6, 5, 0]), (271, [4, 3, 1]), (221, [2])]\nStep 6: [(219, [6, 5, 0]), (211, [4, 3, 1]), (200, [2])]\nStep 7: [(136, [6, 5]), (130, [4, 3]), (78, [1]), (68, [0])]\nStep 8: [(64, [6]), (56, [5])]\n>>>"
