    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 5 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Lifters' capacities are: [56, 160, 118, 138, 160, 150].\n   - The maximum capacity of a single lifter is 160.\n\n3. **Analyze the Box Weights:**\n   - Box weights are: [202, 297, 200, 241, 156, 177, 70, 78, 133, 176, 75, 70, 167, 240, 299, 91].\n   - The heaviest box is 299, which requires multiple lifters.\n\n4. **Plan the Steps:**\n   - We need to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they require more lifters.\n   - We should try to use the fewest number of lifters per box to maximize the number of boxes lifted per step.\n\n5. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 299: Use lifters [1, 4] (160 + 160 = 320).\n     - Box 297: Use lifters [2, 3, 5] (118 + 138 + 150 = 406).\n     - Box 202: Use lifters [0] (56 is not enough, so this box will be lifted in a later step).\n\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 202: Use lifters [1, 5] (160 + 150 = 310).\n     - Box 241: Use lifters [2, 3] (118 + 138 = 256).\n     - Box 200: Use lifters [4] (160 is not enough, so this box will be lifted in a later step).\n\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 200: Use lifters [1, 5] (160 + 150 = 310).\n     - Box 240: Use lifters [2, 3] (118 + 138 = 256).\n     - Box 176: Use lifters [4] (160 is not enough, so this box will be lifted in a later step).\n\n   - **Step 4:**\n     - Box 176: Use lifters [1, 5] (160 + 150 = 310).\n     - Box 177: Use lifters [2, 3] (118 + 138 = 256).\n     - Box 167: Use lifters [4] (160 is not enough, so this box will be lifted in a later step).\n\n   - **Step 5:**\n     - Box 167: Use lifters [1, 5] (160 + 150 = 310).\n     - Box 156: Use lifters [2, 3] (118 + 138 = 256).\n     - Box 133: Use lifters [4] (160 is enough).\n\n6. **Ensure All Boxes are Lifted:**\n   - Remaining boxes (70, 78, 75, 70, 91) can be lifted by individual lifters in the remaining capacity of steps.\n\n7. **Final Assignment:**\n   - Distribute the remaining boxes among the lifters in the available steps.\n\nHere is the final solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(299, [1, 4]), (297, [2, 3, 5])]\nStep 2: [(202, [1, 5]), (241, [2, 3])]\nStep 3: [(200, [1, 5]), (240, [2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(176, [1, 5]), (177, [2, 3])]\nStep 5: [(167, [1, 5]), (156, [2, 3]), (133, [4])]\n>>>"
