    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - Start assigning lifters to boxes from the heaviest to the lightest, using combinations when needed.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 295: Use lifters [4, 2] (106 + 104 = 210)\n- Box 285: Use lifters [0, 1, 3] (53 + 92 + 86 = 231)\n- Box 279: Use lifters [5] (68)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 280: Use lifters [4, 2] (106 + 104 = 210)\n- Box 207: Use lifters [0, 1, 3] (53 + 92 + 86 = 231)\n- Box 168: Use lifters [5] (68)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 153: Use lifters [4, 2] (106 + 104 = 210)\n- Box 148: Use lifters [0, 1, 3] (53 + 92 + 86 = 231)\n- Box 138: Use lifters [5] (68)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 120: Use lifters [4, 2] (106 + 104 = 210)\n- Box 112: Use lifters [0, 1, 3] (53 + 92 + 86 = 231)\n- Box 74: Use lifters [5] (68)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 63: Use lifters [4, 2] (106 + 104 = 210)\n- Box 46: Use lifters [0, 1, 3] (53 + 92 + 86 = 231)\n- Box 33: Use lifters [5] (68)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 32: Use lifters [4, 2] (106 + 104 = 210)\n\nThis assignment ensures that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps or fewer, using the lifters optimally.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(295, [4, 2]), (285, [0, 1, 3]), (279, [5])]\nStep 2: [(280, [4, 2]), (207, [0, 1, 3]), (168, [5])]\nStep 3: [(153, [4, 2]), (148, [0, 1, 3]), (138, [5])]\nStep 4: [(120, [4, 2]), (112, [0, 1, 3]), (74, [5])]\nStep 5: [(63, [4, 2]), (46, [0, 1, 3]), (33, [5])]\nStep 6: [(32, [4, 2])]\n>>>"
