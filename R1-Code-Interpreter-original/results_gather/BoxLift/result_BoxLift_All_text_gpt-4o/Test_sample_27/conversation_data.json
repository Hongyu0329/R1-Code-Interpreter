    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n3. **Plan the steps:**\n   - In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n   - Start with the heaviest box and assign the necessary lifters to lift it.\n   - Continue assigning lifters to the next heaviest box that can be lifted with the remaining available lifters.\n\n4. **Iterate through the steps:**\n   - Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 299: Needs lifters [0, 1, 2] (160 + 110 + 114 = 384)\n- Box 280: Needs lifters [3, 4, 5] (55 + 54 + 60 = 169)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 275: Needs lifters [0, 1, 2] (160 + 110 + 114 = 384)\n- Box 271: Needs lifters [3, 4, 5] (55 + 54 + 60 = 169)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 255: Needs lifters [0, 1, 2] (160 + 110 + 114 = 384)\n- Box 241: Needs lifters [3, 4, 5] (55 + 54 + 60 = 169)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 234: Needs lifters [0, 1, 2] (160 + 110 + 114 = 384)\n- Box 230: Needs lifters [3, 4, 5] (55 + 54 + 60 = 169)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 187: Needs lifters [0, 1, 2] (160 + 110 + 114 = 384)\n- Box 169: Needs lifters [3, 4, 5] (55 + 54 + 60 = 169)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 155: Needs lifters [0, 1, 2] (160 + 110 + 114 = 384)\n- Box 133: Needs lifters [3, 4, 5] (55 + 54 + 60 = 169)\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 110: Needs lifter [0] (160)\n- Box 89: Needs lifter [1] (110)\n- Box 80: Needs lifter [2] (114)\n- Box 47: Needs lifter [3] (55)\n\nThis plan ensures that all boxes are lifted in exactly 7 steps, utilizing the lifters efficiently.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(299, [0, 1, 2]), (280, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(275, [0, 1, 2]), (271, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 3: [(255, [0, 1, 2]), (241, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(234, [0, 1, 2]), (230, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(187, [0, 1, 2]), (169, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(155, [0, 1, 2]), (133, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 7: [(110, [0]), (89, [1]), (80, [2]), (47, [3])]\n>>>"
