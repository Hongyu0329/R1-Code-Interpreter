    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes, as they will require more lifters or specific combinations of lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Match Lifters to Boxes**: Try to match lifters to boxes in a way that maximizes the number of boxes lifted per step. Consider the maximum lifting capacities of the lifters and the possibility of combining lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\n3. **Prioritize Single Lifter Lifts**: If a box can be lifted by a single lifter, prioritize that to free up other lifters for heavier boxes.\n\n4. **Combine Lifters for Heavier Boxes**: For boxes that cannot be lifted by a single lifter, combine lifters in a way that their combined capacity is just enough to lift the box, minimizing the number of lifters used.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Steps**: Repeat the process for each step, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible.\n\n6. **Check Step Limit**: Ensure that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps or fewer.\n\nNow, let's apply this strategy to the given problem:\n\n- **Box Weights**: [21, 96, 83, 73, 100, 73, 55, 25]\n- **Lifter Capacities**: [62, 79, 54]\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 96: Combine lifters 0 (62) and 2 (54) to lift (116 capacity).\n- Box 73: Lifter 1 (79) can lift alone.\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 100: Combine lifters 0 (62) and 1 (79) to lift (141 capacity).\n- Box 73: Lifter 2 (54) cannot lift alone, so we need to wait for the next step.\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 83: Combine lifters 1 (79) and 2 (54) to lift (133 capacity).\n- Box 55: Lifter 0 (62) can lift alone.\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 73: Combine lifters 0 (62) and 2 (54) to lift (116 capacity).\n- Box 25: Lifter 1 (79) can lift alone.\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 21: Lifter 2 (54) can lift alone.\n\nAll boxes are lifted within 5 steps, which is within the 6-step limit.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(96, [0, 2]), (73, [1])]\nStep 2: [(100, [0, 1])]\nStep 3: [(83, [1, 2]), (55, [0])]\nStep 4: [(73, [0, 2]), (25, [1])]\nStep 5: [(21, [2])]\n>>>"
