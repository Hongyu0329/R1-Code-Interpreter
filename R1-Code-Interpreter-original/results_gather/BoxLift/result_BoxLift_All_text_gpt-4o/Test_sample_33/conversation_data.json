    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We have a maximum of 8 steps to lift all boxes.\n\n2. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the strongest available lifters.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted:**\n   - Continue assigning lifters to boxes in each step until all boxes are lifted.\n   - Keep track of the number of steps to ensure it does not exceed 8.\n\n5. **Optimize the Steps:**\n   - Aim to lift as many boxes as possible in each step by efficiently using the lifters.\n\nNow, let's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n- **Boxes (sorted by weight):** [393, 342, 304, 297, 274, 262, 259, 256, 239, 209, 183, 176, 159, 154, 141, 103, 90, 88, 59, 47]\n- **Lifters (sorted by capacity):** [188, 177, 173, 119, 86, 50]\n\n**Step-by-step Assignment:**\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 393: [188, 177, 50] (Total: 415)\n  - Box 342: [173, 119, 86] (Total: 378)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 304: [188, 119] (Total: 307)\n  - Box 297: [177, 119] (Total: 296)\n  - Box 47: [50] (Total: 50)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 274: [188, 86] (Total: 274)\n  - Box 262: [177, 86] (Total: 263)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 259: [188, 86] (Total: 274)\n  - Box 256: [173, 86] (Total: 259)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 239: [188, 50] (Total: 238)\n  - Box 209: [177, 50] (Total: 227)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 183: [188] (Total: 188)\n  - Box 176: [177] (Total: 177)\n  - Box 59: [50] (Total: 50)\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Box 159: [173] (Total: 173)\n  - Box 154: [119, 50] (Total: 169)\n\n- **Step 8:**\n  - Box 141: [188] (Total: 188)\n  - Box 103: [119] (Total: 119)\n  - Box 90: [86] (Total: 86)\n  - Box 88: [86] (Total: 86)\n\nThis solution uses exactly 8 steps, which is the maximum allowed, and all boxes are lifted.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(393, [0, 1, 5]), (342, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(304, [0, 3]), (297, [1, 3]), (47, [5])]\nStep 3: [(274, [0, 4]), (262, [1, 4])]\nStep 4: [(259, [0, 4]), (256, [2, 4])]\nStep 5: [(239, [0, 5]), (209, [1, 5])]\nStep 6: [(183, [0]), (176, [1]), (59, [5])]\nStep 7: [(159, [2]), (154, [3, 5])]\nStep 8: [(141, [0]), (103, [3]), (90, [4]), (88, [4])]\n>>>"
