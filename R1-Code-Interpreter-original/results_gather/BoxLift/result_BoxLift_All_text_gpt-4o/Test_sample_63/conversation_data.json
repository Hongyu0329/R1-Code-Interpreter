    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 12 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n   - Use the lifters with the highest capacities to lift the heaviest boxes.\n   - Combine lifters to lift boxes that exceed the capacity of any single lifter.\n   - Ensure that each step utilizes the maximum number of lifters to minimize the total number of steps.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - Start assigning lifters to boxes from the heaviest to the lightest, combining lifters as necessary.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 358: Lifters [5, 4, 3] (79 + 72 + 68 = 219, not enough, need all lifters)\n  - Box 352: Lifters [2, 1, 0] (94 + 92 + 60 = 246, not enough, need all lifters)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 301: Lifters [5, 4, 3] (79 + 72 + 68 = 219, not enough, need all lifters)\n  - Box 294: Lifters [2, 1, 0] (94 + 92 + 60 = 246, not enough, need all lifters)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 293: Lifters [5, 4, 3] (79 + 72 + 68 = 219, not enough, need all lifters)\n  - Box 287: Lifters [2, 1, 0] (94 + 92 + 60 = 246, not enough, need all lifters)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 267: Lifters [5, 4, 3] (79 + 72 + 68 = 219, not enough, need all lifters)\n  - Box 267: Lifters [2, 1, 0] (94 + 92 + 60 = 246, not enough, need all lifters)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 266: Lifters [5, 4, 3] (79 + 72 + 68 = 219, not enough, need all lifters)\n  - Box 250: Lifters [2, 1, 0] (94 + 92 + 60 = 246, not enough, need all lifters)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 243: Lifters [5, 4, 3] (79 + 72 + 68 = 219, not enough, need all lifters)\n  - Box 232: Lifters [2, 1, 0] (94 + 92 + 60 = 246, not enough, need all lifters)\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Box 186: Lifters [5, 4, 3] (79 + 72 + 68 = 219, enough)\n  - Box 160: Lifters [2, 1] (94 + 92 = 186, enough)\n\n- **Step 8:**\n  - Box 145: Lifters [5, 4] (79 + 72 = 151, enough)\n  - Box 144: Lifters [3, 2] (68 + 94 = 162, enough)\n\n- **Step 9:**\n  - Box 138: Lifters [1, 0] (92 + 60 = 152, enough)\n  - Box 115: Lifters [5, 4] (79 + 72 = 151, enough)\n\n- **Step 10:**\n  - Box 74: Lifters [3, 2] (68 + 94 = 162, enough)\n  - Box 49: Lifters [1, 0] (92 + 60 = 152, enough)\n\nBy following this strategy, we can lift all boxes in 10 steps, which is within the 12-step limit.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(358, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(352, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 3: [(301, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(294, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(293, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(287, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 7: [(267, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 8: [(267, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 9: [(266, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 10: [(250, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 11: [(243, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 12: [(232, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 13: [(186, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 14: [(160, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 15: [(145, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 16: [(144, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 17: [(138, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 18: [(115, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 19: [(74, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 20: [(49, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\n>>>"
