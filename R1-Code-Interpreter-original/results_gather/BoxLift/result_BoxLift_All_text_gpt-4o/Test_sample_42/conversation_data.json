    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Analyze the Weights and Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [86, 183, 78, 85, 112, 170, 130, 121, 208, 226, 39, 176, 68, 256, 56, 34]\n   - Lifter capacities: [116, 81, 149, 77, 138]\n\n3. **Strategy for Lifting:**\n   - Start by matching boxes that can be lifted by a single lifter.\n   - For heavier boxes, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box weight.\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first to ensure they are lifted within the step limit.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 226: Combine lifters [0, 2] (116 + 149 = 265)\n- Box 183: Combine lifters [1, 4] (81 + 138 = 219)\n- Box 176: Lifter [2] (149)\n- Box 170: Lifter [4] (138)\n- Box 130: Lifter [0] (116)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 208: Combine lifters [0, 2] (116 + 149 = 265)\n- Box 121: Lifter [4] (138)\n- Box 112: Lifter [0] (116)\n- Box 86: Lifter [2] (149)\n- Box 85: Lifter [1] (81)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 256: Combine lifters [0, 2, 4] (116 + 149 + 138 = 403)\n- Box 78: Lifter [1] (81)\n- Box 68: Lifter [0] (116)\n- Box 56: Lifter [2] (149)\n- Box 39: Lifter [4] (138)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 34: Lifter [1] (81)\n\n5. **Verify:**\n   - All boxes are lifted.\n   - The solution uses 4 steps, which is within the 6-step limit.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(226, [0, 2]), (183, [1, 4]), (176, [2]), (170, [4]), (130, [0])]\nStep 2: [(208, [0, 2]), (121, [4]), (112, [0]), (86, [2]), (85, [1])]\nStep 3: [(256, [0, 2, 4]), (78, [1]), (68, [0]), (56, [2]), (39, [4])]\nStep 4: [(34, [1])]\n>>>"
