    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: The heaviest boxes are 92, 84, and 72. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**: The lifters have capacities of 64, 48, and 63. No single lifter can lift the heaviest boxes alone.\n\n3. **Combine Lifters for Heavy Boxes**: \n   - The heaviest box (92) can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 64 and 48 (total 112).\n   - The second heaviest box (84) can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 63 and 48 (total 111).\n   - The third heaviest box (72) can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 64 and 48 (total 112).\n\n4. **Assign Remaining Boxes**: \n   - The remaining boxes are 55, 48, 33, and 19.\n   - The box weighing 55 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 64.\n   - The box weighing 48 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 48.\n   - The box weighing 33 can be lifted by the lifter with capacity 63.\n   - The box weighing 19 can be lifted by any lifter, but we will need to ensure all boxes are lifted in the minimum steps.\n\n5. **Plan Steps**:\n   - **Step 1**: Lift the heaviest box (92) using lifters 0 and 1.\n   - **Step 2**: Lift the second heaviest box (84) using lifters 1 and 2.\n   - **Step 3**: Lift the third heaviest box (72) using lifters 0 and 1.\n   - **Step 4**: Lift the remaining boxes (55, 48, 33, 19) using individual lifters.\n\nLet's assign the lifters to the boxes in each step:\n\n- **Step 1**: Lift box 92 using lifters 0 and 1.\n- **Step 2**: Lift box 84 using lifters 1 and 2.\n- **Step 3**: Lift box 72 using lifters 0 and 1.\n- **Step 4**: \n  - Lift box 55 using lifter 0.\n  - Lift box 48 using lifter 1.\n  - Lift box 33 using lifter 2.\n  - Lift box 19 using any lifter (let's use lifter 0).\n\nNow, let's format the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(92, [0, 1])]\nStep 2: [(84, [1, 2])]\nStep 3: [(72, [0, 1])]\nStep 4: [(55, [0]), (48, [1]), (33, [2]), (19, [0])]\n>>>"
