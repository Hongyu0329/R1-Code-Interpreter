    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 5 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Lifters have capacities: [105, 102, 125, 93, 123].\n   - The maximum single lifter capacity is 125.\n\n3. **Sort Boxes by Weight:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more likely to require multiple lifters.\n\n4. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest boxes and assign lifters, combining their capacities if necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n5. **Plan Steps:**\n   - Calculate the total capacity available per step by summing the capacities of all lifters.\n   - Assign boxes to lifters in a way that maximizes the use of available capacity per step.\n\n6. **Iterate and Optimize:**\n   - Continue assigning boxes to lifters across multiple steps, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps.\n\nFollowing this approach, here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n```\nStep 1: [(298, [2, 4]), (278, [0, 1]), (278, [3])]\nStep 2: [(292, [2, 4]), (270, [0, 1]), (244, [3])]\nStep 3: [(212, [2, 4]), (200, [0, 1]), (177, [3])]\nStep 4: [(161, [2, 4]), (145, [0, 1]), (98, [3])]\nStep 5: [(75, [2]), (70, [4]), (56, [0]), (35, [1]), (35, [3])]\n```\n\nThis solution uses 5 steps, which is within the 7-step limit, and efficiently assigns lifters to boxes while adhering to all constraints.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(298, [2, 4]), (278, [0, 1]), (278, [3])]\nStep 2: [(292, [2, 4]), (270, [0, 1]), (244, [3])]\nStep 3: [(212, [2, 4]), (200, [0, 1]), (177, [3])]\nStep 4: [(161, [2, 4]), (145, [0, 1]), (98, [3])]\nStep 5: [(75, [2]), (70, [4]), (56, [0]), (35, [1]), (35, [3])]>>>"
