    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n   - Use the lifters with the highest capacities to lift the heaviest boxes.\n   - Combine lifters to lift boxes that exceed the capacity of any single lifter.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - Assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and using the strongest available lifters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 340: Lifters [1, 2] (178 + 196 = 374)\n- Box 307: Lifters [0, 5] (142 + 144 = 286)\n- Box 293: Lifters [4, 6] (101 + 50 = 151)\n- Box 250: Lifters [3] (52)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 245: Lifters [1, 2] (178 + 196 = 374)\n- Box 244: Lifters [0, 5] (142 + 144 = 286)\n- Box 244: Lifters [4, 6] (101 + 50 = 151)\n- Box 216: Lifters [3] (52)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 196: Lifters [2] (196)\n- Box 173: Lifters [1] (178)\n- Box 166: Lifters [0, 5] (142 + 144 = 286)\n- Box 143: Lifters [4, 6] (101 + 50 = 151)\n- Box 130: Lifters [3] (52)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 126: Lifters [1] (178)\n- Box 103: Lifters [2] (196)\n- Box 90: Lifters [0] (142)\n- Box 76: Lifters [5] (144)\n- Box 66: Lifters [4] (101)\n- Box 55: Lifters [3] (52)\n- Box 54: Lifters [6] (50)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- All boxes are lifted in the previous steps.\n\n**Step 6:**\n- All boxes are lifted in the previous steps.\n\nBy following this strategy, we can lift all the boxes in 4 steps, which is within the 6-step limit.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(340, [1, 2]), (307, [0, 5]), (293, [4, 6]), (250, [3])]\nStep 2: [(245, [1, 2]), (244, [0, 5]), (244, [4, 6]), (216, [3])]\nStep 3: [(196, [2]), (173, [1]), (166, [0, 5]), (143, [4, 6]), (130, [3])]\nStep 4: [(126, [1]), (103, [2]), (90, [0]), (76, [5]), (66, [4]), (55, [3]), (54, [6])]\n>>>"
