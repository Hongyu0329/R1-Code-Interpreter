    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 24 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 9 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy for Solution:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and find a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - Continue assigning lifters to boxes in descending order of box weight.\n   - Ensure that each step uses the maximum number of lifters available to minimize the total number of steps.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - We will iterate through the list of boxes, starting with the heaviest, and assign lifters to each box.\n   - We will keep track of which lifters are used in each step and ensure no lifter is used more than once per step.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(370, [0, 1, 3]), (308, [4, 5]), (302, [2])]\nStep 2: [(335, [0, 1, 4]), (245, [3, 5]), (243, [2])]\nStep 3: [(360, [0, 1, 3]), (245, [4, 5]), (243, [2])]\nStep 4: [(212, [0, 1]), (198, [3, 4]), (192, [2, 5])]\nStep 5: [(183, [0, 1]), (182, [3, 4]), (174, [2, 5])]\nStep 6: [(170, [0, 1]), (167, [3, 4]), (156, [2, 5])]\nStep 7: [(135, [0, 1]), (134, [3, 4]), (131, [2, 5])]\nStep 8: [(124, [0, 1]), (123, [3, 4]), (87, [2, 5])]\nStep 9: [(86, [0, 1]), (79, [3, 4]), (58, [2, 5]), (45, [0])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 9 steps or fewer, using the available lifters optimally."
