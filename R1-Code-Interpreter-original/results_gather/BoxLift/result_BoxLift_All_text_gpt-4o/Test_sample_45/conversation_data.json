    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Box**: The heaviest box weighs 100. This box cannot be lifted by any single lifter since the maximum capacity of any lifter is 78. Therefore, multiple lifters must combine to lift this box.\n\n2. **Combine Lifters for Heavy Boxes**: \n   - For the 100-weight box, we can combine lifters with capacities 78 and 22 (indices 1 and 0) to lift it in one step.\n   - The next heaviest box is 79, which can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 58 and 22 (indices 0 and 3).\n\n3. **Assign Remaining Lifters to Other Boxes**:\n   - After assigning lifters to the heaviest boxes, we need to efficiently use the remaining lifters to lift the other boxes.\n\n4. **Plan Steps**:\n   - **Step 1**: Lift the heaviest box (100) using lifters 1 and 0. Lift the 79-weight box using lifters 0 and 3.\n   - **Step 2**: Use lifters to lift the next heaviest boxes that can be lifted individually or combined.\n   - **Step 3**: Ensure all remaining boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Ensure All Boxes are Lifted in 3 Steps**:\n   - We need to ensure that all boxes are lifted within the 3-step limit.\n\nLet's assign the lifters to the boxes:\n\n- **Step 1**:\n  - Lift the 100-weight box using lifters 1 and 0: (100, [1, 0])\n  - Lift the 79-weight box using lifters 0 and 3: (79, [0, 3])\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Lift the 67-weight box using lifter 2: (67, [2])\n  - Lift the 67-weight box using lifter 1: (67, [1])\n  - Lift the 32-weight box using lifter 3: (32, [3])\n\n- **Step 3**:\n  - Lift the 37-weight box using lifter 2: (37, [2])\n  - Lift the 31-weight box using lifter 3: (31, [3])\n  - Lift the 22-weight box using lifter 0: (22, [0])\n\nBy following this plan, all boxes are lifted in 3 steps, adhering to the rules.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(100, [1, 0]), (79, [0, 3])]\nStep 2: [(67, [2]), (67, [1]), (32, [3])]\nStep 3: [(37, [2]), (31, [3]), (22, [0])]\n>>>"
