    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 9 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and require more lifters.\n   - Use the maximum capacity of lifters efficiently by combining them to lift heavier boxes.\n   - Ensure that each step uses the available lifters optimally.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest remaining boxes using the available lifters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\nLet's assign the lifters to the boxes:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 379: Use lifters [5, 4, 3] (132 + 117 + 130 = 379)\n  - Box 367: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (63 + 51 + 130 = 244, not enough, so adjust)\n  - Adjust: Box 367: Use lifters [5, 3, 2] (132 + 130 + 110 = 372, enough)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 320: Use lifters [5, 4, 3] (132 + 117 + 110 = 359, enough)\n  - Box 318: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (63 + 51 + 130 = 244, not enough, so adjust)\n  - Adjust: Box 318: Use lifters [5, 3, 2] (132 + 130 + 110 = 372, enough)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 256: Use lifters [5, 4] (132 + 117 = 249, not enough, so adjust)\n  - Adjust: Box 256: Use lifters [5, 3, 2] (132 + 130 + 110 = 372, enough)\n  - Box 255: Use lifters [0, 1, 4] (63 + 51 + 117 = 231, not enough, so adjust)\n  - Adjust: Box 255: Use lifters [5, 4, 3] (132 + 117 + 110 = 359, enough)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 247: Use lifters [5, 4] (132 + 117 = 249, enough)\n  - Box 236: Use lifters [0, 1, 3] (63 + 51 + 110 = 224, not enough, so adjust)\n  - Adjust: Box 236: Use lifters [5, 4, 2] (132 + 117 + 110 = 359, enough)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 218: Use lifters [5, 3] (132 + 110 = 242, enough)\n  - Box 200: Use lifters [4, 2] (117 + 110 = 227, enough)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 172: Use lifters [5, 2] (132 + 110 = 242, enough)\n  - Box 144: Use lifters [4, 1] (117 + 51 = 168, enough)\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Box 136: Use lifters [5, 0] (132 + 63 = 195, enough)\n  - Box 125: Use lifters [4, 1] (117 + 51 = 168, enough)\n\n- **Step 8:**\n  - Box 111: Use lifters [5, 0] (132 + 63 = 195, enough)\n  - Box 93: Use lifters [4, 1] (117 + 51 = 168, enough)\n\n- **Step 9:**\n  - Box 88: Use lifters [5] (132 = 132, enough)\n  - Box 87: Use lifters [4] (117 = 117, enough)\n  - Box 64: Use lifters [3] (110 = 110, enough)\n  - Box 58: Use lifters [2] (110 = 110, enough)\n\nNow, let's format the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(379, [5, 4, 3]), (367, [5, 3, 2])]\nStep 2: [(320, [5, 4, 3]), (318, [5, 3, 2])]\nStep 3: [(256, [5, 3, 2]), (255, [5, 4, 3])]\nStep 4: [(247, [5, 4]), (236, [5, 4, 2])]\nStep 5: [(218, [5, 3]), (200, [4, 2])]\nStep 6: [(172, [5, 2]), (144, [4, 1])]\nStep 7: [(136, [5, 0]), (125, [4, 1])]\nStep 8: [(111, [5, 0]), (93, [4, 1])]\nStep 9: [(88, [5]), (87, [4]), (64, [3]), (58, [2])]\n>>>"
