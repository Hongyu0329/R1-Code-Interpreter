    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and resources:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with weights: [57, 112, 121, 49, 166, 143, 169, 43, 90, 66, 23, 143].\n   - We have 5 lifters with capacities: [103, 49, 95, 97, 98].\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 4 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort boxes in descending order of weight: [169, 166, 143, 143, 121, 112, 90, 66, 57, 49, 43, 23].\n   - Sort lifters in descending order of capacity: [103, 98, 97, 95, 49].\n\n3. **Plan the steps:**\n   - **Step 1:** Focus on the heaviest boxes first.\n     - Box 169: Needs multiple lifters. Use lifters 0, 1, 2, and 3 (103 + 98 + 97 + 95 = 393).\n     - Box 166: Use lifters 0, 1, and 2 (103 + 98 + 97 = 298).\n     - Box 143: Use lifters 0 and 1 (103 + 98 = 201).\n     - Box 143: Use lifters 0 and 1 (103 + 98 = 201).\n   - **Step 2:** Continue with the next heaviest boxes.\n     - Box 121: Use lifters 0 and 2 (103 + 95 = 198).\n     - Box 112: Use lifters 0 and 1 (103 + 98 = 201).\n     - Box 90: Use lifter 0 (103).\n     - Box 66: Use lifter 1 (98).\n   - **Step 3:** Lift the remaining boxes.\n     - Box 57: Use lifter 0 (103).\n     - Box 49: Use lifter 3 (95).\n     - Box 43: Use lifter 1 (98).\n     - Box 23: Use lifter 4 (49).\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted.\n   - Ensure no lifter exceeds their capacity.\n   - Ensure the number of steps is minimized and within the limit.\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(169, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (166, [0, 1, 2]), (143, [0, 1]), (143, [0, 1])]\nStep 2: [(121, [0, 2]), (112, [0, 1]), (90, [0]), (66, [1])]\nStep 3: [(57, [0]), (49, [3]), (43, [1]), (23, [4])]\n>>>"
