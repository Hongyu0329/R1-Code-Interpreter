    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps, with a maximum of 8 steps allowed.\n\n2. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the strongest available lifter(s) to it.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Repeat this process for each box, ensuring that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Steps:**\n   - For each step, assign as many boxes as possible using the available lifters.\n   - Track which lifters are used in each step and ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n5. **Check the Number of Steps:**\n   - Ensure that all boxes are lifted within the allowed 8 steps.\n\nFollowing this approach, here is the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(349, [0, 4]), (342, [1, 5]), (338, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(309, [0, 6]), (299, [1, 2]), (278, [3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(277, [0, 5]), (270, [1, 6]), (266, [2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(240, [0, 4]), (236, [1, 5]), (220, [2, 6])]\nStep 5: [(207, [0, 3]), (207, [1, 4]), (195, [2, 5])]\nStep 6: [(185, [0, 6]), (162, [1, 3]), (124, [2, 4])]\nStep 7: [(119, [0]), (112, [1]), (101, [2]), (89, [3]), (76, [4]), (47, [5])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 7 steps, which is within the allowed 8 steps, and follows all the given rules."
