    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 4 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 9 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Lifter capacities are [52, 55, 63, 44].\n   - The total lifting capacity of all lifters combined in one step is 214.\n\n3. **Sort Boxes by Weight:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first: [193, 191, 169, 156, 139, 123, 117, 100, 91, 90, 47, 36].\n\n4. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest boxes and assign lifters in a way that maximizes the use of their capacities.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n\n5. **Plan Each Step:**\n   - Calculate the best combination of lifters for each box, ensuring that each lifter is used only once per step.\n   - Repeat the process for each step until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 193: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (52 + 55 + 63 = 170, not enough, so add lifter 3: 44, total = 214)\n  - Box 36: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 191: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n  - Box 47: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 169: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (52 + 55 + 63 = 170)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 156: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (52 + 55 + 63 = 170)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 139: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (52 + 55 + 63 = 170)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 123: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (52 + 55 + 63 = 170)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Box 117: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (52 + 55 + 63 = 170)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 8:**\n  - Box 100: Use lifters [0, 1] (52 + 55 = 107)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 9:**\n  - Box 91: Use lifters [0, 1] (52 + 55 = 107)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 10:**\n  - Box 90: Use lifters [0, 1] (52 + 55 = 107)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 11:**\n  - Box 47: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\nThis plan uses 11 steps, which exceeds the limit of 9 steps. Let's optimize further by combining more boxes in each step:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 193: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 191: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 169: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 156: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 139: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 123: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Box 117: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (52 + 55 + 63 + 44 = 214)\n\n- **Step 8:**\n  - Box 100: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (52 + 55 + 63 = 170)\n  - Box 44: Use lifter [3] (44)\n\n- **Step 9:**\n  - Box 91: Use lifters [0, 1] (52 + 55 = 107)\n  - Box 90: Use lifters [2, 3] (63 + 44 = 107)\n\n- **Step 10:**\n  - Box 47: Use lifter [3] (44)\n  - Box 36: Use lifter [2] (63)\n\nThis plan uses 10 steps, which still exceeds the limit.
