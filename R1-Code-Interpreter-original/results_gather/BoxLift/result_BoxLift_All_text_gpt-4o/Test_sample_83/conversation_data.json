    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest remaining boxes using available lifters.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - Assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that the total weight lifted by a group of lifters does not exceed their combined capacity.\n   - Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n**Box Weights (sorted):** [400, 392, 383, 371, 352, 295, 283, 281, 280, 213, 204, 151, 142, 142, 135, 111, 55, 50, 46, 42]\n\n**Lifter Capacities (sorted):** [162, 159, 143, 141, 128, 62]\n\n**Steps:**\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 400: [0, 1, 2] (162 + 159 + 143 = 464)\n  - Box 392: [3, 4] (141 + 128 = 269)\n  - Box 383: [5] (62)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 371: [0, 1, 2] (162 + 159 + 143 = 464)\n  - Box 352: [3, 4] (141 + 128 = 269)\n  - Box 295: [5] (62)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 283: [0, 1] (162 + 159 = 321)\n  - Box 281: [2, 3] (143 + 141 = 284)\n  - Box 280: [4, 5] (128 + 62 = 190)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 213: [0, 1] (162 + 159 = 321)\n  - Box 204: [2, 3] (143 + 141 = 284)\n  - Box 151: [4] (128)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 142: [0] (162)\n  - Box 142: [1] (159)\n  - Box 135: [2] (143)\n  - Box 111: [3] (141)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 55: [0] (162)\n  - Box 50: [1] (159)\n  - Box 46: [2] (143)\n  - Box 42: [3] (141)\n\nThis plan ensures that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps, which is within the 7-step limit.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(400, [0, 1, 2]), (392, [3, 4]), (383, [5])]\nStep 2: [(371, [0, 1, 2]), (352, [3, 4]), (295, [5])]\nStep 3: [(283, [0, 1]), (281, [2, 3]), (280, [4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(213, [0, 1]), (204, [2, 3]), (151, [4])]\nStep 5: [(142, [0]), (142, [1]), (135, [2]), (111, [3])]\nStep 6: [(55, [0]), (50, [1]), (46, [2]), (42, [3])]\n>>>"
