    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 4 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Lifters have capacities: 71, 58, 104, 105.\n   - The total capacity of all lifters combined in one step is 338.\n\n3. **Sort Boxes by Weight:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first: [196, 187, 166, 143, 142, 129, 101, 90, 79, 77, 43, 22].\n\n4. **Plan the Lifting Steps:**\n   - We need to strategically combine lifters to lift the heaviest boxes first, while ensuring that we use the minimum number of steps.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n   **Step 1:**\n   - Box 196: Use lifters [0, 1, 2] (71 + 58 + 104 = 233)\n   - Box 90: Use lifter [3] (105)\n\n   **Step 2:**\n   - Box 187: Use lifters [0, 1, 3] (71 + 58 + 105 = 234)\n   - Box 101: Use lifter [2] (104)\n\n   **Step 3:**\n   - Box 166: Use lifters [0, 2] (71 + 104 = 175)\n   - Box 77: Use lifter [1] (58)\n   - Box 22: Use lifter [3] (105)\n\n   **Step 4:**\n   - Box 143: Use lifters [0, 3] (71 + 105 = 176)\n   - Box 79: Use lifter [2] (104)\n   - Box 43: Use lifter [1] (58)\n\n   **Step 5:**\n   - Box 142: Use lifters [0, 2] (71 + 104 = 175)\n   - Box 129: Use lifters [1, 3] (58 + 105 = 163)\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted.\n   - Ensure the number of steps is within the limit (5 steps used, which is less than or equal to 6).\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(196, [0, 1, 2]), (90, [3])]\nStep 2: [(187, [0, 1, 3]), (101, [2])]\nStep 3: [(166, [0, 2]), (77, [1]), (22, [3])]\nStep 4: [(143, [0, 3]), (79, [2]), (43, [1])]\nStep 5: [(142, [0, 2]), (129, [1, 3])]\n>>>"
