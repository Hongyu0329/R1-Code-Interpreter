    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and rules:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps and complete the task in 5 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n3. **Assign lifters to boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the strongest available lifters.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Repeat the process for the next heaviest box until all boxes are assigned.\n\n4. **Plan the steps:**\n   - Group the assignments into steps, ensuring each lifter is used only once per step.\n   - Aim to lift as many boxes as possible in each step.\n\n5. **Iterate and adjust:**\n   - If the initial plan exceeds 5 steps, re-evaluate and adjust the assignments to optimize the number of steps.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given data:\n\n**Box weights (sorted):** [168, 155, 154, 138, 127, 125, 121, 105, 58, 55, 25, 21]\n\n**Lifter capacities (sorted):** [98, 78, 75, 51, 43]\n\n**Step-by-step assignment:**\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 168: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 155: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 154: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 155: Lifters [0, 2] (98 + 75 = 173)\n  - Box 154: Lifters [1, 3] (78 + 51 = 129, need adjustment)\n  - Box 138: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 154: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 138: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 127: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 138: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 127: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 125: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 127: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 125: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 121: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Box 125: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 121: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 105: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Box 121: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 105: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 58: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 8:**\n  - Box 105: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 58: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 55: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 9:**\n  - Box 58: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 55: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 25: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 10:**\n  - Box 55: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 25: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n  - Box 21: Lifters [4] (43, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 11:**\n  - Box 25: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n  - Box 21: Lifters [2, 3] (75 + 51 = 126, need adjustment)\n\n- **Step 12:**\n  - Box 21: Lifters [0, 1] (98 + 78 = 176)\n\nAfter careful consideration and adjustments, the final solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(168, [0, 1]), (155, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(154, [0, 1]), (138, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(127, [0, 1]), (125, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 4: [(121, [0, 1]), (105, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 5: [(58, [0]), (55, [1]), (25, [2]), (21, [3])]\n>>>"
