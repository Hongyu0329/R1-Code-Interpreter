    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 24 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n   - Use the lifters with the highest capacities to lift the heaviest boxes.\n   - Combine lifters to lift boxes that exceed the capacity of any single lifter.\n   - Ensure that all lifters are utilized efficiently in each step.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - Assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest lifters.\n   - If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Repeat the process for each step until all boxes are lifted.\n\n4. **Solution:**\n   - We will list the steps and the assignments of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(388, [0, 1, 2]), (386, [3, 4, 5]), (323, [6])]\nStep 2: [(277, [0, 1]), (261, [2, 3]), (227, [4, 5]), (205, [6])]\nStep 3: [(212, [0, 1]), (178, [2, 3]), (173, [4, 5]), (152, [6])]\nStep 4: [(150, [0, 1]), (134, [2, 3]), (127, [4, 5]), (124, [6])]\nStep 5: [(123, [0, 1]), (114, [2, 3]), (106, [4]), (81, [5]), (71, [6])]\nStep 6: [(63, [0]), (47, [1]), (47, [2]), (41, [3])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps, utilizing the lifters efficiently and adhering to the rules provided."
