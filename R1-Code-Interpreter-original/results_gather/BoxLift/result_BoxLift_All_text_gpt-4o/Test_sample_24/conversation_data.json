    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps, with a maximum of 9 steps allowed.\n\n2. **Analyze the Weights and Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [119, 110, 359, 148, 237, 71, 309, 213, 117, 394, 79, 353, 230, 77, 242, 239, 66, 259, 212, 358, 194, 397, 274, 101]\n   - Lifter capacities: [60, 103, 156, 108, 179, 110]\n\n3. **Strategy for Lifting:**\n   - Start by matching the heaviest boxes with the combination of lifters that can lift them.\n   - Use the lifters with the highest capacities first to maximize the number of boxes lifted per step.\n   - Ensure that all lifters are utilized efficiently in each step.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 394: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 359: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 353: Lifters [3] (108)\n   \n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 397: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 358: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 309: Lifters [3] (108)\n   \n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 274: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 259: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 242: Lifters [3] (108)\n   \n   - **Step 4:**\n     - Box 239: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 237: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 230: Lifters [3] (108)\n   \n   - **Step 5:**\n     - Box 213: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 212: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 194: Lifters [3] (108)\n   \n   - **Step 6:**\n     - Box 148: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 119: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 117: Lifters [3] (108)\n   \n   - **Step 7:**\n     - Box 110: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 101: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 79: Lifters [3] (108)\n   \n   - **Step 8:**\n     - Box 77: Lifters [2, 4] (156 + 179 = 335)\n     - Box 71: Lifters [0, 1, 5] (60 + 103 + 110 = 273)\n     - Box 66: Lifters [3] (108)\n\n5. **Final Output:**\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(394, [2, 4]), (359, [0, 1, 5]), (353, [3])]\nStep 2: [(397, [2, 4]), (358, [0, 1, 5]), (309, [3])]\nStep 3: [(274, [2, 4]), (259, [0, 1, 5]), (242, [3])]\nStep 4: [(239, [2, 4]), (237, [0, 1, 5]), (230, [3])]\nStep 5: [(213, [2, 4]), (212, [0, 1, 5]), (194, [3])]\nStep 6: [(148, [2, 4]), (119, [0, 1, 5]), (117, [3])]\nStep 7: [(110, [2, 4]), (101, [0, 1, 5]), (79, [3])]\nStep 8: [(77, [2, 4]), (71, [0, 1, 5]), (66, [3])]\n>>>"
