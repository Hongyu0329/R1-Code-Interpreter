    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 5 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 5 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n   **Step 1:**\n   - Box 198: Use lifters 0 (97) and 3 (111) to lift this box. Total capacity = 97 + 111 = 208.\n   - Box 194: Use lifters 1 (90) and 4 (76) to lift this box. Total capacity = 90 + 76 = 166.\n   - Box 27: Use lifter 2 (80) to lift this box. Total capacity = 80.\n\n   **Step 2:**\n   - Box 184: Use lifters 0 (97) and 3 (111) to lift this box. Total capacity = 97 + 111 = 208.\n   - Box 183: Use lifters 1 (90) and 4 (76) to lift this box. Total capacity = 90 + 76 = 166.\n   - Box 27: Use lifter 2 (80) to lift this box. Total capacity = 80.\n\n   **Step 3:**\n   - Box 172: Use lifters 0 (97) and 3 (111) to lift this box. Total capacity = 97 + 111 = 208.\n   - Box 166: Use lifters 1 (90) and 4 (76) to lift this box. Total capacity = 90 + 76 = 166.\n   - Box 81: Use lifter 2 (80) to lift this box. Total capacity = 80.\n\n   **Step 4:**\n   - Box 154: Use lifters 0 (97) and 3 (111) to lift this box. Total capacity = 97 + 111 = 208.\n   - Box 144: Use lifters 1 (90) and 4 (76) to lift this box. Total capacity = 90 + 76 = 166.\n   - Box 117: Use lifter 2 (80) to lift this box. Total capacity = 80.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - All boxes are lifted in 4 steps, which is within the 5-step limit.\n   - Each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(198, [0, 3]), (194, [1, 4]), (27, [2])]\nStep 2: [(184, [0, 3]), (183, [1, 4]), (27, [2])]\nStep 3: [(172, [0, 3]), (166, [1, 4]), (81, [2])]\nStep 4: [(154, [0, 3]), (144, [1, 4]), (117, [2])]\n>>>"
