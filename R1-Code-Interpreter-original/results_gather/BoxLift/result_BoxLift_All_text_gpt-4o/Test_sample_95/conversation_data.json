    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes, as they will require more lifters or stronger lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Match Lifters to Boxes**: Try to match the heaviest boxes with the available lifters, either individually or in combination, to lift them in the fewest steps.\n\n3. **Consider Lifter Combinations**: If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n\n4. **Optimize Steps**: Aim to lift as many boxes as possible in each step by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\n5. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring it is done in 3 steps or fewer.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the given data:\n\n- **Box Weights**: [79, 48, 16, 95, 67, 41, 62, 22]\n- **Lifter Capacities**: [52, 41, 41, 67]\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 95: Needs multiple lifters. Use lifters with capacities 67 and 41 (indices 3 and 0) to lift it.\n- Box 79: Use lifters with capacities 52 and 41 (indices 0 and 2) to lift it.\n- Box 48: Use lifter with capacity 52 (index 0) to lift it.\n- Box 41: Use lifter with capacity 41 (index 1) to lift it.\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 67: Use lifter with capacity 67 (index 3) to lift it.\n- Box 62: Use lifters with capacities 41 and 41 (indices 1 and 2) to lift it.\n- Box 22: Use lifter with capacity 41 (index 1) to lift it.\n- Box 16: Use lifter with capacity 41 (index 2) to lift it.\n\n**Step 3:**\n- All boxes are already lifted in the first two steps.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(95, [3, 0]), (79, [0, 2]), (48, [0]), (41, [1])]\nStep 2: [(67, [3]), (62, [1, 2]), (22, [1]), (16, [2])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures all boxes are lifted in 2 steps, which is within the 3-step limit."
