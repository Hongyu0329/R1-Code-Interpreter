    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 5 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Boxes: [46, 58, 71, 73, 84, 85, 102, 105, 105, 123, 125, 141]\n   - Lifters: [45, 77, 109, 120]\n\n3. **Plan the steps:**\n   - Start with the heaviest boxes and assign lifters to them, as they are the most restrictive.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Assign lifters to boxes:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 141: Lifters [2, 3] (109 + 120 = 229)\n     - Box 125: Lifters [0, 1] (45 + 77 = 122, but we need to adjust this to fit the constraints, so use [1, 3] instead)\n     - Box 105: Lifter [2]\n     - Box 46: Lifter [0]\n\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 123: Lifters [2, 3] (109 + 120 = 229)\n     - Box 105: Lifters [1, 0] (77 + 45 = 122)\n     - Box 85: Lifter [3]\n     - Box 58: Lifter [0]\n\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 102: Lifters [2, 0] (109 + 45 = 154)\n     - Box 84: Lifter [1]\n     - Box 73: Lifter [3]\n     - Box 71: Lifter [2]\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted.\n   - Ensure no lifter is used more than once per step.\n   - Ensure the total number of steps is 5 or fewer.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the solution is:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(141, [2, 3]), (125, [1, 3]), (105, [2]), (46, [0])]\nStep 2: [(123, [2, 3]), (105, [1, 0]), (85, [3]), (58, [0])]\nStep 3: [(102, [2, 0]), (84, [1]), (73, [3]), (71, [2])]\n>>>"
