    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n   - Use the maximum capacity of lifters efficiently by combining them to lift heavier boxes.\n   - Ensure that each step uses the available lifters optimally.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest remaining boxes using the available lifters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 362: Use lifters [2, 4] (172 + 130 = 302) and [5, 6] (59 + 130 = 189) to lift it.\n- Box 353: Use lifters [0, 1] (139 + 55 = 194) and [3] (82) to lift it.\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 339: Use lifters [2, 4] (172 + 130 = 302) and [5, 6] (59 + 130 = 189) to lift it.\n- Box 322: Use lifters [0, 1] (139 + 55 = 194) and [3] (82) to lift it.\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 280: Use lifters [2, 4] (172 + 130 = 302) to lift it.\n- Box 282: Use lifters [0, 1] (139 + 55 = 194) and [3] (82) to lift it.\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 243: Use lifters [2, 4] (172 + 130 = 302) to lift it.\n- Box 182: Use lifters [0, 1] (139 + 55 = 194) to lift it.\n- Box 167: Use lifter [3] (82) and [5] (59) to lift it.\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 164: Use lifters [2, 4] (172 + 130 = 302) to lift it.\n- Box 158: Use lifters [0, 1] (139 + 55 = 194) to lift it.\n- Box 150: Use lifter [3] (82) and [5] (59) to lift it.\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 142: Use lifters [2, 4] (172 + 130 = 302) to lift it.\n- Box 75: Use lifter [0] (139) to lift it.\n- Box 71: Use lifter [1] (55) and [3] (82) to lift it.\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 72: Use lifter [2] (172) to lift it.\n- Box 64: Use lifter [0] (139) to lift it.\n- Box 53: Use lifter [1] (55) to lift it.\n- Box 52: Use lifter [3] (82) to lift it.\n- Box 45: Use lifter [4] (130) to lift it.\n\nBy following this plan, we can lift all the boxes in 7 steps. Here is the final assignment:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(362, [2, 4, 5, 6]), (353, [0, 1, 3])]\nStep 2: [(339, [2, 4, 5, 6]), (322, [0, 1, 3])]\nStep 3: [(280, [2, 4]), (282, [0, 1, 3])]\nStep 4: [(243, [2, 4]), (182, [0, 1]), (167, [3, 5])]\nStep 5: [(164, [2, 4]), (158, [0, 1]), (150, [3, 5])]\nStep 6: [(142, [2, 4]), (75, [0]), (71, [1, 3])]\nStep 7: [(72, [2]), (64, [0]), (53, [1]), (52, [3]), (45, [4])]\n>>>"
