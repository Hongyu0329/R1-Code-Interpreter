    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Weights and Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [99, 159, 55, 86, 215, 56, 271, 167, 212, 87, 78, 211, 246, 153, 227, 287]\n   - Lifter capacities: [143, 50, 70, 79, 136]\n\n3. **Strategy for Lifting:**\n   - Start by matching boxes that can be lifted by a single lifter.\n   - For heavier boxes, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box weight.\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first to ensure they are lifted within the step limit.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 99: Lifter 0 (capacity 143)\n- Box 55: Lifter 2 (capacity 70)\n- Box 86: Lifter 4 (capacity 136)\n- Box 56: Lifter 3 (capacity 79)\n- Box 78: Lifter 1 (capacity 50) + Lifter 2 (capacity 70)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 159: Lifter 0 (capacity 143) + Lifter 1 (capacity 50)\n- Box 87: Lifter 3 (capacity 79) + Lifter 4 (capacity 136)\n- Box 153: Lifter 2 (capacity 70) + Lifter 4 (capacity 136)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 215: Lifter 0 (capacity 143) + Lifter 4 (capacity 136)\n- Box 167: Lifter 1 (capacity 50) + Lifter 3 (capacity 79)\n- Box 211: Lifter 2 (capacity 70) + Lifter 3 (capacity 79) + Lifter 4 (capacity 136)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 271: Lifter 0 (capacity 143) + Lifter 1 (capacity 50) + Lifter 2 (capacity 70)\n- Box 212: Lifter 3 (capacity 79) + Lifter 4 (capacity 136)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 246: Lifter 0 (capacity 143) + Lifter 1 (capacity 50) + Lifter 2 (capacity 70)\n- Box 227: Lifter 3 (capacity 79) + Lifter 4 (capacity 136)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 287: Lifter 0 (capacity 143) + Lifter 1 (capacity 50) + Lifter 2 (capacity 70) + Lifter 3 (capacity 79)\n\nThis solution uses 6 steps, which is within the 7-step limit.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(99, [0]), (55, [2]), (86, [4]), (56, [3]), (78, [1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(159, [0, 1]), (87, [3, 4]), (153, [2, 4])]\nStep 3: [(215, [0, 4]), (167, [1, 3]), (211, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 4: [(271, [0, 1, 2]), (212, [3, 4])]\nStep 5: [(246, [0, 1, 2]), (227, [3, 4])]\nStep 6: [(287, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\n>>>"
