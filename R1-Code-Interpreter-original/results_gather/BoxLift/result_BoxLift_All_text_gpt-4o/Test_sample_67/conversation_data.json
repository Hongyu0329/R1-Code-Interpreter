    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and resources:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to complete the task in 6 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n\n3. **Plan the lifting strategy:**\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first by combining lifters if necessary.\n   - Use the lifters with the highest capacities first to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Execute the plan:**\n   - Assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that the total weight lifted does not exceed the combined capacity of the assigned lifters.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 281: Lifters [2, 5] (143 + 132 = 275, not enough, so use all lifters [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = 566)\n- Box 268: Lifters [0, 1, 2] (97 + 53 + 143 = 293)\n- Box 278: Lifters [4, 5] (94 + 132 = 226, not enough, so use [0, 1, 2, 4, 5] = 519)\n- Box 272: Lifters [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (566)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 217: Lifters [2, 5] (143 + 132 = 275)\n- Box 183: Lifters [0, 2] (97 + 143 = 240)\n- Box 145: Lifters [2, 4] (143 + 94 = 237)\n- Box 93: Lifters [0] (97)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 93: Lifters [0] (97)\n- Box 86: Lifters [0] (97)\n- Box 81: Lifters [0] (97)\n- Box 74: Lifters [0] (97)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 50: Lifters [1] (53)\n- Box 43: Lifters [1] (53)\n- Box 34: Lifters [1] (53)\n- Box 31: Lifters [1] (53)\n\nBy following this strategy, we can lift all boxes in 4 steps. Here is the detailed solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(281, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (268, [0, 1, 2]), (278, [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]), (272, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(217, [2, 5]), (183, [0, 2]), (145, [2, 4]), (93, [0])]\nStep 3: [(93, [0]), (86, [0]), (81, [0]), (74, [0])]\nStep 4: [(50, [1]), (43, [1]), (34, [1]), (31, [1])]\n>>>"
