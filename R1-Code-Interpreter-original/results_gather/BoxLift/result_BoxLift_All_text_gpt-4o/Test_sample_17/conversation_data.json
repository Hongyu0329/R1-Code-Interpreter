    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy for Solution:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n   - Calculate the total lifting capacity available in each step.\n   - Assign lifters to boxes starting from the heaviest box, using combinations if needed.\n   - Repeat the process for each step until all boxes are lifted.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - We will go through each step, assigning lifters to boxes, ensuring that the total weight lifted does not exceed the combined capacity of the lifters used.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 265: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 526)\n- Box 245: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (Total capacity: 446)\n- Box 220: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3] (Total capacity: 372)\n- Box 216: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3] (Total capacity: 372)\n- Box 202: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3] (Total capacity: 372)\n- Box 182: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (Total capacity: 296)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 165: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (Total capacity: 296)\n- Box 160: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (Total capacity: 296)\n- Box 148: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (Total capacity: 296)\n- Box 143: [Lifters 0, 1, 2] (Total capacity: 296)\n- Box 133: [Lifters 0, 1] (Total capacity: 174)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 130: [Lifters 0, 1] (Total capacity: 174)\n- Box 104: [Lifters 0, 1] (Total capacity: 174)\n- Box 96: [Lifter 2] (Capacity: 96)\n- Box 93: [Lifter 2] (Capacity: 96)\n- Box 60: [Lifter 3] (Capacity: 122)\n- Box 34: [Lifter 4] (Capacity: 74)\n\nBy following this strategy, we can lift all boxes in 3 steps, which is within the 7-step limit.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(265, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (245, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), (220, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (216, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (202, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (182, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(165, [0, 1, 2]), (160, [0, 1, 2]), (148, [0, 1, 2]), (143, [0, 1, 2]), (133, [0, 1])]\nStep 3: [(130, [0, 1]), (104, [0, 1]), (96, [2]), (93, [2]), (60, [3]), (34, [4])]\n>>>"
