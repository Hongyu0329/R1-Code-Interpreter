    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n\n3. **Plan the Lifting Strategy:**\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n   - Combine lifters to lift boxes that are too heavy for a single lifter.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Execute the Plan:**\n   - Assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that the total weight lifted by the combined lifters does not exceed their combined capacities.\n   - Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Optimize the Steps:**\n   - Aim to lift as many boxes as possible in each step to minimize the total number of steps.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 287: Use lifters [4, 5] (143 + 131 = 274, not enough, so use all lifters [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = 61 + 62 + 122 + 75 + 143 + 131 = 594)\n- Box 256: Use lifters [4, 5] (143 + 131 = 274)\n- Box 253: Use lifters [4, 5] (143 + 131 = 274)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 236: Use lifters [4, 5] (143 + 131 = 274)\n- Box 196: Use lifters [4, 5] (143 + 131 = 274)\n- Box 171: Use lifters [2, 4] (122 + 143 = 265)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 162: Use lifters [2, 4] (122 + 143 = 265)\n- Box 153: Use lifters [2, 4] (122 + 143 = 265)\n- Box 142: Use lifter [4] (143)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 111: Use lifter [5] (131)\n- Box 94: Use lifter [5] (131)\n- Box 83: Use lifter [5] (131)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 79: Use lifter [5] (131)\n- Box 68: Use lifter [5] (131)\n- Box 57: Use lifter [5] (131)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 42: Use lifter [5] (131)\n\nThis plan ensures that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps or fewer, using the available lifters efficiently.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(287, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (256, [4, 5]), (253, [4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(236, [4, 5]), (196, [4, 5]), (171, [2, 4])]\nStep 3: [(162, [2, 4]), (153, [2, 4]), (142, [4])]\nStep 4: [(111, [5]), (94, [5]), (83, [5])]\nStep 5: [(79, [5]), (68, [5]), (57, [5])]\nStep 6: [(42, [5])]\n>>>"
