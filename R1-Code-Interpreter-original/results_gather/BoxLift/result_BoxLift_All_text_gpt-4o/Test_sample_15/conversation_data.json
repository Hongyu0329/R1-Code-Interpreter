    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: The heaviest boxes are 83, 70, and 53. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**: The lifters have capacities of 42, 53, 74, and 78. The strongest lifter can lift up to 78, which means the heaviest box (83) will require at least two lifters.\n\n3. **Plan for Step 1**:\n   - The heaviest box is 83. The two strongest lifters (74 and 78) can combine to lift this box.\n   - The next heaviest box is 70. The lifter with a capacity of 74 can lift this box alone.\n   - The next heaviest box is 53. The lifter with a capacity of 53 can lift this box alone.\n   - The remaining lifter with a capacity of 42 can lift the box weighing 31.\n\n   Step 1: [(83, [2, 3]), (70, [2]), (53, [1]), (31, [0])]\n\n4. **Plan for Step 2**:\n   - The remaining boxes are 50, 27, 21, and 17.\n   - The lifter with a capacity of 78 can lift the box weighing 50.\n   - The lifter with a capacity of 74 can lift the box weighing 27.\n   - The lifter with a capacity of 53 can lift the box weighing 21.\n   - The lifter with a capacity of 42 can lift the box weighing 17.\n\n   Step 2: [(50, [3]), (27, [2]), (21, [1]), (17, [0])]\n\n5. **Check for Additional Steps**: All boxes have been lifted in two steps, which is within the limit of three steps.\n\nBy following this plan, we ensure that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible, adhering to the rules provided.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(83, [2, 3]), (70, [2]), (53, [1]), (31, [0])]\nStep 2: [(50, [3]), (27, [2]), (21, [1]), (17, [0])]>>>"
