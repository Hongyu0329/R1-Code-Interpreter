    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and rules:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 3 or fewer steps.\n   - We aim to minimize the number of steps.\n\n2. **List the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Box weights: [38, 74, 55, 11, 82, 43, 34, 20]\n   - Lifter capacities: [76, 78, 46, 63]\n\n3. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sorted boxes: [11, 20, 34, 38, 43, 55, 74, 82]\n   - Sorted lifters: [46, 63, 76, 78]\n\n4. **Plan the steps:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Lifter 3 (78) can lift box 74.\n     - Lifter 2 (76) can lift box 55.\n     - Lifter 1 (63) can lift box 43.\n     - Lifter 0 (46) can lift box 38.\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Lifter 3 (78) can lift box 82 with the help of lifter 0 (46) to make a combined capacity of 124.\n     - Lifter 2 (76) can lift box 34.\n     - Lifter 1 (63) can lift box 20.\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Lifter 0 (46) can lift box 11.\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - All boxes are lifted within 3 steps.\n   - Each lifter is used only once per step.\n   - The solution adheres to all rules.\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(74, [3]), (55, [2]), (43, [1]), (38, [0])]\nStep 2: [(82, [3, 0]), (34, [2]), (20, [1])]\nStep 3: [(11, [0])]\n>>>"
