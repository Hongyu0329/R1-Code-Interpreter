    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, while adhering to the rules provided. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes, as they will require more lifters or stronger lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Match Lifters to Boxes**: Try to match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or a combination of lifters whose combined capacity can lift the box.\n\n3. **Optimize Each Step**: In each step, aim to lift as many boxes as possible by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed three.\n\nGiven the box weights: [70, 51, 67, 51, 34, 82, 20, 93] and lifter capacities: [64, 51, 79, 80], let's proceed with the solution:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 93: Needs lifters 2 (79) and 3 (80) combined (total 159).\n- Box 82: Needs lifters 0 (64) and 1 (51) combined (total 115).\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 70: Needs lifters 2 (79) alone.\n- Box 67: Needs lifters 3 (80) alone.\n- Box 51: Needs lifter 1 (51) alone.\n- Box 34: Needs lifter 0 (64) alone.\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 51: Needs lifter 1 (51) alone.\n- Box 20: Needs lifter 0 (64) alone.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, using the available lifters efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(93, [2, 3]), (82, [0, 1])]\nStep 2: [(70, [2]), (67, [3]), (51, [1]), (34, [0])]\nStep 3: [(51, [1]), (20, [0])]\n>>>"
