    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps and complete the task in 13 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Analyze the Weights and Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [254, 205, 272, 360, 320, 328, 267, 223, 337, 238, 134, 235, 388, 160, 244, 378, 349, 262, 104, 396]\n   - Lifter capacities: [132, 86, 81, 199, 93, 92]\n\n3. **Strategy for Lifting:**\n   - Start by matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest possible combinations of lifters.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that exceed the capacity of any single lifter.\n   - Prioritize lifting heavier boxes first to ensure that we can lift all boxes within the step limit.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n   - Calculate possible combinations of lifters for each box.\n   - Assign lifters to boxes in a way that maximizes the number of boxes lifted per step.\n\n5. **Execution:**\n   - We will iterate through the boxes, starting with the heaviest, and assign lifters accordingly.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(396, [0, 3]), (388, [1, 4, 5]), (378, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(360, [0, 1, 5]), (349, [2, 3, 4]), (328, [0, 3])]\nStep 3: [(320, [1, 4, 5]), (337, [2, 3, 4]), (272, [0, 3])]\nStep 4: [(267, [1, 4, 5]), (262, [2, 3, 4]), (254, [0, 3])]\nStep 5: [(244, [1, 4, 5]), (238, [2, 3, 4]), (235, [0, 3])]\nStep 6: [(223, [1, 4, 5]), (205, [2, 3, 4]), (160, [0, 3])]\nStep 7: [(134, [1, 4]), (104, [2])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 7 steps, which is well within the 13-step limit. Each step uses the available lifters efficiently, combining their capacities to lift the heaviest possible boxes first."
