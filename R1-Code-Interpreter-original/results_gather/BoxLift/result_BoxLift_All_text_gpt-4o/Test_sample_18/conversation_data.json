    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each step utilizes the maximum number of lifters to minimize the total number of steps.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - For each step, try to lift the heaviest remaining boxes using available lifters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 400: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 392: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 387: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 306: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 305: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 288: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 284: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 275: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 274: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 259: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 233: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 214: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 198: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 183: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 179: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 177: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 161: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 132: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 95: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n- Box 67: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n- Box 40: [Lifters 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total capacity: 827)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 51: [Lifters 2] (Total capacity: 51)\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 4 steps, which is within the 7-step limit.\n\n<<<Step 1: [(400, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (392, [2]), (387, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (306, [2]), (305, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (288, [2]), (284, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6])]\nStep 2: [(275, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (274, [2]), (259, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (233, [2]), (214, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (198, [2]), (183, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6])]\nStep 3: [(179, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (177, [2]), (161, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (132, [2]), (95, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]), (67, [2]), (40, [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6])]\nStep 4: [(51, [2])]>>>"
