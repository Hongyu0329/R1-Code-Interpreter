    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints and rules provided, and ensure that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps or fewer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: \n   - The heaviest boxes are 200, 172, 162, 151, 147, and 142. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify the Strongest Lifters**:\n   - The strongest lifters have capacities of 97, 76, 54, 53, and 48.\n\n3. **Pair Lifters for Heaviest Boxes**:\n   - For the heaviest boxes, we need to combine lifters to meet or exceed the box weight.\n\n4. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**:\n   - Start with the heaviest boxes and assign the strongest available lifters, combining their capacities as needed.\n\n5. **Ensure All Boxes are Lifted in 6 Steps**:\n   - Distribute the remaining boxes among the lifters in a way that uses the fewest steps.\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Step 1**:\n- Box 200: [Lifter 0 (97), Lifter 2 (76), Lifter 4 (48)] = 221\n- Box 172: [Lifter 1 (54), Lifter 3 (53)] = 107\n\n**Step 2**:\n- Box 162: [Lifter 0 (97), Lifter 1 (54), Lifter 3 (53)] = 204\n- Box 151: [Lifter 2 (76), Lifter 4 (48)] = 124\n\n**Step 3**:\n- Box 147: [Lifter 0 (97), Lifter 1 (54)] = 151\n- Box 142: [Lifter 2 (76), Lifter 3 (53)] = 129\n\n**Step 4**:\n- Box 96: [Lifter 0 (97)]\n- Box 85: [Lifter 1 (54), Lifter 3 (53)] = 107\n\n**Step 5**:\n- Box 83: [Lifter 0 (97)]\n- Box 77: [Lifter 1 (54), Lifter 2 (76)] = 130\n\n**Step 6**:\n- Box 59: [Lifter 0 (97)]\n- Box 39: [Lifter 1 (54)]\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps or fewer, using the available lifters efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(200, [0, 2, 4]), (172, [1, 3])]\nStep 2: [(162, [0, 1, 3]), (151, [2, 4])]\nStep 3: [(147, [0, 1]), (142, [2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(96, [0]), (85, [1, 3])]\nStep 5: [(83, [0]), (77, [1, 2])]\nStep 6: [(59, [0]), (39, [1])]\n>>>"
