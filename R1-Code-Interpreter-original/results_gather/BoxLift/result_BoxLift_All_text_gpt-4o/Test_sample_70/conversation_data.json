    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: The heaviest boxes are 91, 82, and 79. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**: The lifters have capacities of 49, 80, and 79. The lifter with a capacity of 80 can lift most boxes alone except for the heaviest ones.\n\n3. **Plan for Heaviest Boxes**:\n   - The box weighing 91 will need at least two lifters. The best combination is the lifters with capacities 80 and 49, as they can lift a total of 129.\n   - The box weighing 82 can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 80 and another lifter with a capacity of 49 or 79.\n   - The box weighing 79 can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 79 alone.\n\n4. **Plan for Remaining Boxes**: After dealing with the heaviest boxes, we can assign the remaining boxes to the lifters based on their capacities.\n\n5. **Minimize Steps**: We need to ensure that all boxes are lifted in 4 steps or fewer.\n\nLet's assign the boxes to the lifters:\n\n- **Step 1**:\n  - Lift the box weighing 91 using lifters with capacities 80 and 49.\n  - Lift the box weighing 79 using the lifter with capacity 79.\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Lift the box weighing 82 using lifters with capacities 80 and 49.\n  - Lift the box weighing 61 using the lifter with capacity 79.\n\n- **Step 3**:\n  - Lift the box weighing 57 using the lifter with capacity 79.\n  - Lift the box weighing 43 using the lifter with capacity 49.\n  - Lift the box weighing 29 using the lifter with capacity 80.\n\n- **Step 4**:\n  - Lift the box weighing 20 using the lifter with capacity 49.\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(91, [0, 1]), (79, [2])]\nStep 2: [(82, [0, 1]), (61, [2])]\nStep 3: [(57, [2]), (43, [1]), (29, [0])]\nStep 4: [(20, [1])]\n>>>"
