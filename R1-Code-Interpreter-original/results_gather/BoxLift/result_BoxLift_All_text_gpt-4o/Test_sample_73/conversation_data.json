    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 10 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy for Solution:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step to maximize the number of boxes lifted.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n   - Start by attempting to lift the heaviest boxes with available lifters.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that exceed the capacity of individual lifters.\n   - Continue this process, ensuring that each step uses the maximum possible number of lifters.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - We will list the steps and the assignments of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 394: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 383: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 358: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 350: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 342: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 297: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 283: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 276: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 250: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 242: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 210: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 152: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 146: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 136: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 134: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 125: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 116: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 101: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 94: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 87: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 75: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 62: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 59: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n  - Box 54: [Lifters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total capacity: 606)\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 4 steps, which is within the 10-step limit.\n\n<<<Step 1: [(394, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (383, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (358, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (350, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (342, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (297, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(283, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (276, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (250, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (242, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (210, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (152, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 3: [(146, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (136, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (134, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (125, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (116, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (101, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(94, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (87, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (75, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (62, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (59, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (54, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]>>>"
