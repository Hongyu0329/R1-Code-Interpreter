    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps, with a maximum of 12 steps allowed.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Lifters have capacities: [54, 61, 106, 60, 63].\n   - The total capacity of all lifters combined is 344.\n\n3. **Analyze the Box Weights:**\n   - The boxes have weights: [50, 219, 120, 245, 204, 172, 274, 225, 94, 270, 158, 253, 174, 40, 252, 124].\n   - The heaviest box is 274, and the lightest is 40.\n\n4. **Strategy for Lifting:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they require more lifters.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n   - Use individual lifters for lighter boxes when possible.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n   - We will assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that the total weight lifted does not exceed the combined capacity of the lifters.\n\nLet's proceed with the assignment:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Lift 274 using lifters [2, 4] (106 + 63 = 169) and [0, 1, 3] (54 + 61 + 60 = 175).\n  - Lift 40 using lifter [0].\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Lift 270 using lifters [2, 3, 4] (106 + 60 + 63 = 229).\n  - Lift 50 using lifter [0].\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Lift 253 using lifters [2, 3, 4] (106 + 60 + 63 = 229).\n  - Lift 61 using lifter [1].\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Lift 252 using lifters [2, 3, 4] (106 + 60 + 63 = 229).\n  - Lift 54 using lifter [0].\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Lift 245 using lifters [2, 3, 4] (106 + 60 + 63 = 229).\n  - Lift 61 using lifter [1].\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - Lift 225 using lifters [2, 3, 4] (106 + 60 + 63 = 229).\n  - Lift 54 using lifter [0].\n\n- **Step 7:**\n  - Lift 219 using lifters [2, 3, 4] (106 + 60 + 63 = 229).\n  - Lift 54 using lifter [0].\n\n- **Step 8:**\n  - Lift 204 using lifters [2, 3, 4] (106 + 60 + 63 = 229).\n  - Lift 54 using lifter [0].\n\n- **Step 9:**\n  - Lift 174 using lifters [2, 3] (106 + 60 = 166).\n  - Lift 94 using lifter [4].\n\n- **Step 10:**\n  - Lift 172 using lifters [2, 3] (106 + 60 = 166).\n  - Lift 94 using lifter [4].\n\n- **Step 11:**\n  - Lift 158 using lifters [2, 3] (106 + 60 = 166).\n  - Lift 94 using lifter [4].\n\n- **Step 12:**\n  - Lift 124 using lifters [2, 3] (106 + 60 = 166).\n  - Lift 94 using lifter [4].\n\nThis assignment ensures that all boxes are lifted within 12 steps, using the minimum number of steps possible given the constraints.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(274, [2, 4, 0, 1, 3]), (40, [0])]\nStep 2: [(270, [2, 3, 4]), (50, [0])]\nStep 3: [(253, [2, 3, 4]), (61, [1])]\nStep 4: [(252, [2, 3, 4]), (54, [0])]\nStep 5: [(245, [2, 3, 4]), (61, [1])]\nStep 6: [(225, [2, 3, 4]), (54, [0])]\nStep 7: [(219, [2, 3, 4]), (54, [0])]\nStep 8: [(204, [2, 3, 4]), (54, [0])]\nStep 9: [(174, [2, 3]), (94, [4])]\nStep 10: [(172, [2, 3]), (94, [4])]\nStep 11: [(158, [2, 3]), (94, [4])]\nStep 12: [(124, [2, 3]), (94, [4])]\n>>>"
