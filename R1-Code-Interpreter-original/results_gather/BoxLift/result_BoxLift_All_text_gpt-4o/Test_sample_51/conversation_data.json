    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all boxes, while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 4 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 5 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Box Weights and Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [142, 109, 62, 158, 37, 50, 180, 128, 61, 123, 44, 51]\n   - Lifter capacities: [93, 71, 82, 91]\n\n3. **Plan the Lifting Strategy:**\n   - Start by identifying the heaviest boxes and see if they can be lifted by combining lifters.\n   - Use the lifters efficiently by matching them to boxes they can lift alone or in combination.\n   - Aim to lift as many boxes as possible in each step.\n\n4. **Execute the Plan:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 180: Needs all lifters [0, 1, 2, 3] (93 + 71 + 82 + 91 = 337, sufficient to lift 180)\n     - Box 158: Needs lifters [0, 3] (93 + 91 = 184, sufficient to lift 158)\n     - Box 142: Needs lifters [0, 2] (93 + 82 = 175, sufficient to lift 142)\n     - Box 128: Needs lifters [0, 1] (93 + 71 = 164, sufficient to lift 128)\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 123: Needs lifters [0, 2] (93 + 82 = 175, sufficient to lift 123)\n     - Box 109: Needs lifters [0, 1] (93 + 71 = 164, sufficient to lift 109)\n     - Box 62: Lifter 2 (82) can lift alone\n     - Box 61: Lifter 3 (91) can lift alone\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 51: Lifter 2 (82) can lift alone\n     - Box 50: Lifter 3 (91) can lift alone\n     - Box 44: Lifter 0 (93) can lift alone\n     - Box 37: Lifter 1 (71) can lift alone\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted.\n   - Ensure the number of steps is minimized and within the limit.\n\nHere is the solution in the required format:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(180, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(158, [0, 3]), (142, [0, 2]), (128, [0, 1])]\nStep 3: [(123, [0, 2]), (109, [0, 1]), (62, [2]), (61, [3])]\nStep 4: [(51, [2]), (50, [3]), (44, [0]), (37, [1])]\n>>>"
