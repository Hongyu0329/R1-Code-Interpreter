    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We have a maximum of 7 steps to lift all boxes.\n\n2. **Analyze the Weights and Capacities:**\n   - Box weights: [289, 375, 107, 145, 257, 48, 141, 83, 136, 368, 59, 133, 186, 266, 353, 73, 66, 210, 247, 79, 342, 318, 337, 162]\n   - Lifter capacities: [75, 189, 162, 181, 118, 194, 137]\n\n3. **Strategy for Lifting:**\n   - Start by matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that exceed the capacity of any single lifter.\n   - Prioritize lifting heavier boxes first to ensure we can lift all within the step limit.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n   - **Step 1:**\n     - Box 375: [Lifter 0, 1, 2] (75 + 189 + 162 = 426)\n     - Box 289: [Lifter 3, 4] (181 + 118 = 299)\n     - Box 257: [Lifter 5, 6] (194 + 137 = 331)\n\n   - **Step 2:**\n     - Box 368: [Lifter 0, 1, 2] (75 + 189 + 162 = 426)\n     - Box 266: [Lifter 3, 4] (181 + 118 = 299)\n     - Box 247: [Lifter 5, 6] (194 + 137 = 331)\n\n   - **Step 3:**\n     - Box 353: [Lifter 0, 1, 2] (75 + 189 + 162 = 426)\n     - Box 342: [Lifter 3, 4] (181 + 118 = 299)\n     - Box 318: [Lifter 5, 6] (194 + 137 = 331)\n\n   - **Step 4:**\n     - Box 337: [Lifter 0, 1, 2] (75 + 189 + 162 = 426)\n     - Box 210: [Lifter 3, 4] (181 + 118 = 299)\n     - Box 186: [Lifter 5, 6] (194 + 137 = 331)\n\n   - **Step 5:**\n     - Box 162: [Lifter 2] (162)\n     - Box 145: [Lifter 3] (181)\n     - Box 141: [Lifter 6] (137)\n     - Box 136: [Lifter 1] (189)\n     - Box 133: [Lifter 5] (194)\n     - Box 107: [Lifter 4] (118)\n\n   - **Step 6:**\n     - Box 83: [Lifter 0] (75)\n     - Box 79: [Lifter 1] (189)\n     - Box 73: [Lifter 2] (162)\n     - Box 66: [Lifter 3] (181)\n     - Box 59: [Lifter 4] (118)\n     - Box 48: [Lifter 5] (194)\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all boxes are lifted within 6 steps.\n   - Verify that no lifter exceeds their capacity in any step.\n\nThe solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided. Here is the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(375, [0, 1, 2]), (289, [3, 4]), (257, [5, 6])]\nStep 2: [(368, [0, 1, 2]), (266, [3, 4]), (247, [5, 6])]\nStep 3: [(353, [0, 1, 2]), (342, [3, 4]), (318, [5, 6])]\nStep 4: [(337, [0, 1, 2]), (210, [3, 4]), (186, [5, 6])]\nStep 5: [(162, [2]), (145, [3]), (141, [6]), (136, [1]), (133, [5]), (107, [4])]\nStep 6: [(83, [0]), (79, [1]), (73, [2]), (66, [3]), (59, [4]), (48, [5])]\n>>>"
