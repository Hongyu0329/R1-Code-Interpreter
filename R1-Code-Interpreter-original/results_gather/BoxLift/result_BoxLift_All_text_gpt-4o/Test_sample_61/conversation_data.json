    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints and rules:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps and complete the task in 5 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Sort the boxes and lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize their utility.\n\n3. **Assign lifters to boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the fewest number of lifters needed to lift it.\n   - Move to the next heaviest box and repeat the process.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Repeat the process for subsequent steps:**\n   - After assigning lifters for the first step, repeat the process for the remaining boxes in subsequent steps.\n   - Continue until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Ensure the solution is within 5 steps:**\n   - If the solution exceeds 5 steps, re-evaluate the assignments to optimize further.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given data:\n\n**Box weights:** [128, 144, 42, 49, 132, 118, 32, 48, 21, 94, 85, 51]  \n**Lifter capacities:** [85, 90, 40, 102]\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 144: Lifters [1, 3] (90 + 102 = 192)\n  - Box 132: Lifters [0, 2] (85 + 40 = 125, but we need to adjust as 132 > 125, so use [0, 3] = 187)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 128: Lifters [1, 3] (90 + 102 = 192)\n  - Box 118: Lifters [0, 2] (85 + 40 = 125)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 94: Lifter [3] (102)\n  - Box 85: Lifter [1] (90)\n  - Box 51: Lifter [0] (85)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 49: Lifter [3] (102)\n  - Box 48: Lifter [1] (90)\n  - Box 42: Lifter [0] (85)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 32: Lifter [2] (40)\n  - Box 21: Lifter [0] (85)\n\nThis solution ensures all boxes are lifted in 5 steps or fewer, using the minimum number of steps possible.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(144, [1, 3]), (132, [0, 3])]\nStep 2: [(128, [1, 3]), (118, [0, 2])]\nStep 3: [(94, [3]), (85, [1]), (51, [0])]\nStep 4: [(49, [3]), (48, [1]), (42, [0])]\nStep 5: [(32, [2]), (21, [0])]\n>>>"
