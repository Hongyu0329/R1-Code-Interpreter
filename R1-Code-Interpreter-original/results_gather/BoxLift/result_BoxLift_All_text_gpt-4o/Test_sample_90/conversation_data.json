    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: The heaviest boxes are 91, 71, 71, and 69. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**: The lifters have capacities of 46, 54, and 47. No single lifter can lift the heaviest boxes alone.\n\n3. **Combine Lifters for Heavy Boxes**: \n   - The heaviest box is 91. The sum of all lifters' capacities is 147, which is more than enough to lift 91. We can use all three lifters to lift this box.\n   - The next heaviest boxes are 71 and 71. We can use two lifters to lift each of these boxes. For example, lifters with capacities 54 and 47 can lift one 71, and lifters with capacities 46 and 47 can lift the other 71.\n   - The box weighing 69 can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 54 and 47.\n\n4. **Lift Lighter Boxes Individually**: \n   - The remaining boxes are 55, 14, 11, and 10. These can be lifted individually by the lifters.\n\n5. **Plan Steps**: \n   - In each step, we can use each lifter only once. We need to distribute the boxes across steps to minimize the total number of steps.\n\nLet's organize the steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Lift the 91 kg box using all three lifters: (91, [0, 1, 2])\n\n- **Step 2**: \n  - Lift one 71 kg box using lifters 1 and 2: (71, [1, 2])\n  - Lift the 55 kg box using lifter 0: (55, [0])\n\n- **Step 3**: \n  - Lift the other 71 kg box using lifters 0 and 2: (71, [0, 2])\n  - Lift the 14 kg box using lifter 1: (14, [1])\n\n- **Step 4**: \n  - Lift the 69 kg box using lifters 1 and 2: (69, [1, 2])\n  - Lift the 11 kg box using lifter 0: (11, [0])\n\n- **Step 5**: \n  - Lift the 10 kg box using lifter 0: (10, [0])\n\nThis plan uses all lifters efficiently and completes the task in 5 steps, which is the maximum allowed.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(91, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(71, [1, 2]), (55, [0])]\nStep 3: [(71, [0, 2]), (14, [1])]\nStep 4: [(69, [1, 2]), (11, [0])]\nStep 5: [(10, [0])]\n>>>"
