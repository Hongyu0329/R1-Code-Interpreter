    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time.\n   - Lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps and complete the task in 9 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the strongest available lifter(s) to it.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Repeat this process for each box, moving from heaviest to lightest.\n\n4. **Plan Each Step:**\n   - In each step, assign as many boxes as possible to the available lifters.\n   - Ensure that no lifter is used more than once per step.\n   - Keep track of which lifters are used in each step and which boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Iterate Until All Boxes Are Lifted:**\n   - Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted.\n   - Ensure the total number of steps does not exceed 9.\n\nFollowing this approach, here is the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(368, [0, 2, 3]), (367, [1, 4, 5]), (350, [6])]\nStep 2: [(344, [0, 2, 3]), (342, [1, 4, 5]), (330, [6])]\nStep 3: [(323, [0, 2, 3]), (310, [1, 4, 5]), (299, [6])]\nStep 4: [(299, [0, 2, 3]), (244, [1, 4, 5]), (231, [6])]\nStep 5: [(225, [0, 2]), (216, [1, 3]), (189, [4, 5]), (179, [6])]\nStep 6: [(165, [0, 2]), (144, [1, 3]), (127, [4, 5]), (124, [6])]\nStep 7: [(107, [0, 1]), (100, [2, 3]), (95, [4]), (93, [5]), (85, [6])]\nStep 8: [(68, [0]), (64, [1]), (49, [2])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution efficiently assigns lifters to boxes, ensuring all boxes are lifted in 8 steps, which is within the 9-step limit."
