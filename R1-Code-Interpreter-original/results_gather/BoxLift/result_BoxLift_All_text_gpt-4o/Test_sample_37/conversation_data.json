    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first using available lifters.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift boxes that are too heavy for a single lifter.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - We will iterate through the sorted list of boxes and assign lifters to each box, ensuring that the total weight lifted by the lifters does not exceed their combined capacity.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 298: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (combined capacity 663)\n  - Box 261: Use lifters [0, 2] (combined capacity 275)\n  - Box 257: Use lifters [0, 3] (combined capacity 252)\n  - Box 255: Use lifters [0, 4] (combined capacity 240)\n  - Box 252: Use lifters [0, 5] (combined capacity 183)\n  - Box 240: Use lifters [1, 2] (combined capacity 250)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 257: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (combined capacity 663)\n  - Box 206: Use lifters [0, 1] (combined capacity 237)\n  - Box 202: Use lifters [0, 2] (combined capacity 275)\n  - Box 187: Use lifters [0, 3] (combined capacity 252)\n  - Box 185: Use lifters [0, 4] (combined capacity 240)\n  - Box 164: Use lifters [0, 5] (combined capacity 183)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 145: Use lifters [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (combined capacity 663)\n  - Box 121: Use lifters [0, 1] (combined capacity 237)\n  - Box 97: Use lifters [0, 2] (combined capacity 275)\n  - Box 55: Use lifters [0, 3] (combined capacity 252)\n\nThis solution uses 3 steps, which is within the 7-step limit. Each step efficiently utilizes the lifters to lift the heaviest possible boxes.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(298, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (261, [0, 2]), (257, [0, 3]), (255, [0, 4]), (252, [0, 5]), (240, [1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(257, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (206, [0, 1]), (202, [0, 2]), (187, [0, 3]), (185, [0, 4]), (164, [0, 5])]\nStep 3: [(145, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (121, [0, 1]), (97, [0, 2]), (55, [0, 3])]\n>>>"
