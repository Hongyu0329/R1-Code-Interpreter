    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Box**: The heaviest box weighs 98, which cannot be lifted by any single lifter or even by combining two lifters. Therefore, all three lifters must work together to lift this box.\n\n2. **Identify Other Heavy Boxes**: The next heaviest box is 60, which can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 63. The box weighing 52 can be lifted by combining the lifters with capacities 49 and 55.\n\n3. **Plan the Steps**:\n   - **Step 1**: Lift the heaviest box (98) using all three lifters.\n   - **Step 2**: Lift the box weighing 60 using the lifter with a capacity of 63. Lift the box weighing 52 using the lifters with capacities 49 and 55.\n   - **Step 3**: Lift the remaining boxes. The box weighing 41 can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 49. The box weighing 31 can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 55. The box weighing 26 can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 63.\n   - **Step 4**: Lift the remaining boxes. The box weighing 20 can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 49. The box weighing 11 can be lifted by the lifter with a capacity of 55.\n\n4. **Ensure All Boxes Are Lifted**: Verify that all boxes are accounted for in the steps.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Format the solution as required.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(98, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(60, [2]), (52, [0, 1])]\nStep 3: [(41, [0]), (31, [1]), (26, [2])]\nStep 4: [(20, [0]), (11, [1])]\n>>>"
