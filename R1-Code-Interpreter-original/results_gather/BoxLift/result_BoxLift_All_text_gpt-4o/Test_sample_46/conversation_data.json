    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes, as they will require more lifters or specific combinations of lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Match Lifters to Boxes**: Try to match the heaviest boxes with the available lifters, either individually or in combination, to lift as many boxes as possible in each step.\n\n3. **Prioritize Single Lifter Assignments**: If a box can be lifted by a single lifter, prioritize that assignment to free up other lifters for heavier boxes.\n\n4. **Combine Lifters for Heavy Boxes**: For boxes that cannot be lifted by a single lifter, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n\n5. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 5.\n\nNow, let's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n- **Box Weights**: [45, 32, 84, 101, 161, 118, 30, 152, 159, 20, 110, 103]\n- **Lifter Capacities**: [39, 32, 112, 102, 75]\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Step 1**:\n- Box 161: Lifters [2, 3] (112 + 102 = 214)\n- Box 32: Lifter [1] (32)\n- Box 30: Lifter [4] (75)\n\n**Step 2**:\n- Box 159: Lifters [2, 3] (112 + 102 = 214)\n- Box 45: Lifters [0, 1] (39 + 32 = 71)\n- Box 20: Lifter [4] (75)\n\n**Step 3**:\n- Box 152: Lifters [2, 3] (112 + 102 = 214)\n- Box 84: Lifters [0, 4] (39 + 75 = 114)\n\n**Step 4**:\n- Box 118: Lifters [2, 4] (112 + 75 = 187)\n- Box 103: Lifter [3] (102)\n- Box 32: Lifter [1] (32)\n\n**Step 5**:\n- Box 110: Lifters [2, 3] (112 + 102 = 214)\n- Box 101: Lifter [3] (102)\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 5 steps or fewer, using the available lifters efficiently.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(161, [2, 3]), (32, [1]), (30, [4])]\nStep 2: [(159, [2, 3]), (45, [0, 1]), (20, [4])]\nStep 3: [(152, [2, 3]), (84, [0, 4])]\nStep 4: [(118, [2, 4]), (103, [3]), (32, [1])]\nStep 5: [(110, [2, 3]), (101, [3])]\n>>>"
