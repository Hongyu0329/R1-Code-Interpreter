    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, ensuring that all rules are followed. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 24 boxes with varying weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to complete the task in 9 steps or fewer.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n   - Keep track of which boxes have been lifted and which lifters are available for each step.\n\n3. **Implementation:**\n   - For each step, attempt to lift as many boxes as possible by matching them with available lifters.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - We will iteratively assign lifters to boxes, ensuring that the total weight lifted in each step is maximized.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n```\nStep 1: [(400, [0, 1, 2]), (369, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(373, [0, 1, 2]), (366, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 3: [(351, [0, 1, 2]), (330, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(318, [0, 1, 2]), (281, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(245, [0, 1]), (243, [2, 3]), (239, [4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(225, [0, 1]), (219, [2, 3]), (192, [4, 5])]\nStep 7: [(186, [0, 1]), (172, [2, 3]), (167, [4, 5])]\nStep 8: [(159, [0, 1]), (131, [2, 3]), (74, [4]), (66, [5])]\nStep 9: [(62, [0]), (61, [1]), (44, [2])]\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 9 steps, adhering to the constraints and rules provided.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(400, [0, 1, 2]), (369, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(373, [0, 1, 2]), (366, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 3: [(351, [0, 1, 2]), (330, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(318, [0, 1, 2]), (281, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(245, [0, 1]), (243, [2, 3]), (239, [4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(225, [0, 1]), (219, [2, 3]), (192, [4, 5])]\nStep 7: [(186, [0, 1]), (172, [2, 3]), (167, [4, 5])]\nStep 8: [(159, [0, 1]), (131, [2, 3]), (74, [4]), (66, [5])]\nStep 9: [(62, [0]), (61, [1]), (44, [2])]\n>>>"
