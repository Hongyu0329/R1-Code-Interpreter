    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: The heaviest boxes are 94, 90, and 67. These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Identify Lifter Capacities**: The lifters have capacities of 56, 77, and 72. No single lifter can lift the heaviest boxes alone.\n\n3. **Combine Lifters for Heaviest Boxes**:\n   - The box weighing 94 can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 56 and 77 (56 + 77 = 133).\n   - The box weighing 90 can be lifted by combining lifters with capacities 77 and 72 (77 + 72 = 149).\n   - The box weighing 67 can be lifted by a single lifter with a capacity of 72.\n\n4. **Assign Remaining Boxes**: After lifting the heaviest boxes, assign the remaining boxes to the lifters in a way that maximizes the use of their capacities.\n\n5. **Plan Steps**:\n   - **Step 1**: Focus on lifting the heaviest boxes.\n   - **Step 2**: Lift the next set of boxes.\n   - **Step 3**: Lift any remaining boxes.\n\nLet's assign the boxes to the lifters:\n\n- **Step 1**:\n  - Lift the 94 kg box using lifters 0 and 1 (56 + 77 = 133).\n  - Lift the 90 kg box using lifters 1 and 2 (77 + 72 = 149).\n  - Lift the 67 kg box using lifter 2 (72).\n\n- **Step 2**:\n  - Lift the 60 kg box using lifter 1 (77).\n  - Lift the 46 kg box using lifter 2 (72).\n  - Lift the 12 kg box using lifter 0 (56).\n\n- **Step 3**:\n  - Lift the 10 kg box using lifter 0 (56).\n  - Lift the other 10 kg box using lifter 1 (77).\n\nThis plan ensures all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the rules.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(94, [0, 1]), (90, [1, 2]), (67, [2])]\nStep 2: [(60, [1]), (46, [2]), (12, [0])]\nStep 3: [(10, [0]), (10, [1])]\n>>>"
