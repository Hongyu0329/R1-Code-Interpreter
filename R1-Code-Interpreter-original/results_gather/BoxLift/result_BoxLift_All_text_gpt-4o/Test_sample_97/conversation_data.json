    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 16 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 6 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - Attempt to match the heaviest available box with the strongest available lifter or combination of lifters.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - Start with the heaviest box and find the best combination of lifters to lift it.\n   - Continue this process, moving to the next heaviest box and available lifters.\n   - Repeat until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given data:\n\n**Box Weights (sorted):** [275, 252, 230, 216, 205, 193, 184, 181, 138, 137, 108, 93, 81, 79, 56, 31]\n\n**Lifter Capacities (sorted):** [157, 156, 151, 51, 47, 45]\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n- **Step 1:**\n  - Box 275: [Lifter 0 (157), Lifter 1 (156)] (Total: 313)\n  - Box 252: [Lifter 2 (151), Lifter 3 (51), Lifter 4 (47)] (Total: 249)\n  - Box 31: [Lifter 5 (45)] (Total: 45)\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - Box 230: [Lifter 0 (157), Lifter 1 (156)] (Total: 313)\n  - Box 216: [Lifter 2 (151), Lifter 3 (51), Lifter 4 (47)] (Total: 249)\n  - Box 56: [Lifter 5 (45)] (Total: 45)\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - Box 205: [Lifter 0 (157), Lifter 1 (156)] (Total: 313)\n  - Box 193: [Lifter 2 (151), Lifter 3 (51)] (Total: 202)\n  - Box 81: [Lifter 4 (47), Lifter 5 (45)] (Total: 92)\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - Box 184: [Lifter 0 (157), Lifter 1 (156)] (Total: 313)\n  - Box 181: [Lifter 2 (151), Lifter 3 (51)] (Total: 202)\n  - Box 79: [Lifter 4 (47), Lifter 5 (45)] (Total: 92)\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - Box 138: [Lifter 0 (157)] (Total: 157)\n  - Box 137: [Lifter 1 (156)] (Total: 156)\n  - Box 108: [Lifter 2 (151)] (Total: 151)\n  - Box 93: [Lifter 3 (51), Lifter 4 (47)] (Total: 98)\n\nThis solution uses 5 steps, which is within the limit of 6 steps.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(275, [0, 1]), (252, [2, 3, 4]), (31, [5])]\nStep 2: [(230, [0, 1]), (216, [2, 3, 4]), (56, [5])]\nStep 3: [(205, [0, 1]), (193, [2, 3]), (81, [4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(184, [0, 1]), (181, [2, 3]), (79, [4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(138, [0]), (137, [1]), (108, [2]), (93, [3, 4])]\n>>>"
