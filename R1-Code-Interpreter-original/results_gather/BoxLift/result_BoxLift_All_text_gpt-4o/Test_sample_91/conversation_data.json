    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Constraints:**\n   - We have 12 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 4 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lifter Capacities:**\n   - Lifter 0 can lift up to 81.\n   - Lifter 1 can lift up to 98.\n   - Lifter 2 can lift up to 62.\n   - Lifter 3 can lift up to 46.\n\n3. **Sort Boxes by Weight:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n\n4. **Plan the Lifting Steps:**\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n   - Combine lifters if necessary to lift heavier boxes.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n5. **Execute the Plan:**\n   - Assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 184: Lifter 1 (98) + Lifter 0 (81) = 179 (not enough, need another lifter)\n- Box 180: Lifter 1 (98) + Lifter 0 (81) = 179 (not enough, need another lifter)\n- Box 159: Lifter 1 (98) + Lifter 0 (81) = 179 (sufficient)\n- Box 138: Lifter 1 (98) + Lifter 2 (62) = 160 (sufficient)\n- Box 128: Lifter 1 (98) + Lifter 3 (46) = 144 (sufficient)\n- Box 110: Lifter 0 (81) + Lifter 2 (62) = 143 (sufficient)\n- Box 97: Lifter 1 (98) = 97 (sufficient)\n- Box 64: Lifter 0 (81) = 64 (sufficient)\n- Box 62: Lifter 2 (62) = 62 (sufficient)\n- Box 47: Lifter 3 (46) = 47 (sufficient)\n- Box 47: Lifter 3 (46) = 47 (sufficient)\n- Box 43: Lifter 3 (46) = 43 (sufficient)\n\n**Step 1:**\n- (159, [0, 1])\n- (138, [1, 2])\n- (128, [1, 3])\n- (110, [0, 2])\n\n**Step 2:**\n- (97, [1])\n- (64, [0])\n- (62, [2])\n- (47, [3])\n\n**Step 3:**\n- (47, [3])\n- (43, [3])\n\nThis solution uses 3 steps, which is within the 7-step limit. Each step efficiently utilizes the lifters to lift the maximum number of boxes possible.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(159, [0, 1]), (138, [1, 2]), (128, [1, 3]), (110, [0, 2])]\nStep 2: [(97, [1]), (64, [0]), (62, [2]), (47, [3])]\nStep 3: [(47, [3]), (43, [3])]>>>"
