    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 24 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 6 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 8 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes possible using available lifters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 394: Lifters [1, 3] (185 + 195)\n- Box 358: Lifters [0, 4] (88 + 147 + 145)\n- Box 352: Lifters [2, 5] (145 + 145 + 62)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 311: Lifters [1, 3] (185 + 195)\n- Box 294: Lifters [0, 4] (88 + 147 + 145)\n- Box 294: Lifters [2, 5] (145 + 145 + 4)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 292: Lifters [1, 3] (185 + 195)\n- Box 213: Lifters [0, 4] (88 + 147)\n- Box 197: Lifters [2, 5] (145 + 145)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 188: Lifters [1, 3] (185 + 195)\n- Box 179: Lifters [0, 4] (88 + 147)\n- Box 177: Lifters [2, 5] (145 + 145)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 172: Lifters [1, 3] (185 + 195)\n- Box 166: Lifters [0, 4] (88 + 147)\n- Box 156: Lifters [2, 5] (145 + 145)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 145: Lifter [1] (185)\n- Box 144: Lifter [3] (195)\n- Box 134: Lifter [0] (88 + 47)\n- Box 123: Lifter [2] (145)\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 97: Lifter [1] (185)\n- Box 91: Lifter [3] (195)\n- Box 88: Lifter [0] (88)\n- Box 53: Lifter [2] (145)\n- Box 51: Lifter [4] (147)\n\nThis solution uses 7 steps, which is within the 8-step limit.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(394, [1, 3]), (358, [0, 4]), (352, [2, 5])]\nStep 2: [(311, [1, 3]), (294, [0, 4]), (294, [2, 5])]\nStep 3: [(292, [1, 3]), (213, [0, 4]), (197, [2, 5])]\nStep 4: [(188, [1, 3]), (179, [0, 4]), (177, [2, 5])]\nStep 5: [(172, [1, 3]), (166, [0, 4]), (156, [2, 5])]\nStep 6: [(145, [1]), (144, [3]), (134, [0]), (123, [2])]\nStep 7: [(97, [1]), (91, [3]), (88, [0]), (53, [2]), (51, [4])]\n>>>"
