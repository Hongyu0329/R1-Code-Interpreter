    "To solve the BoxLift problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 20 boxes with specific weights.\n   - We have 7 lifters with specific maximum lifting capacities.\n   - Each lifter can lift only one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a heavier box.\n   - We need to lift all boxes in 7 or fewer steps.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift.\n   - Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n   - In each step, try to lift the heaviest remaining boxes using available lifters.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Assignment:**\n\n**Step 1:**\n- Box 397: Use lifters [3, 2, 0] (198 + 153 + 100 = 451)\n- Box 392: Use lifters [4, 5, 6] (118 + 100 + 153 = 371)\n- Box 385: Use lifters [1, 2, 3] (70 + 149 + 198 = 417)\n\n**Step 2:**\n- Box 371: Use lifters [3, 2, 0] (198 + 153 + 100 = 451)\n- Box 357: Use lifters [4, 5, 6] (118 + 100 + 153 = 371)\n- Box 343: Use lifters [1, 2, 3] (70 + 149 + 198 = 417)\n\n**Step 3:**\n- Box 303: Use lifters [3, 2, 0] (198 + 153 + 100 = 451)\n- Box 291: Use lifters [4, 5, 6] (118 + 100 + 153 = 371)\n- Box 277: Use lifters [1, 2, 3] (70 + 149 + 198 = 417)\n\n**Step 4:**\n- Box 241: Use lifters [3, 2, 0] (198 + 153 + 100 = 451)\n- Box 231: Use lifters [4, 5, 6] (118 + 100 + 153 = 371)\n- Box 190: Use lifters [1, 2, 3] (70 + 149 + 198 = 417)\n\n**Step 5:**\n- Box 173: Use lifters [3, 2, 0] (198 + 153 + 100 = 451)\n- Box 147: Use lifters [4, 5, 6] (118 + 100 + 153 = 371)\n- Box 138: Use lifters [1, 2, 3] (70 + 149 + 198 = 417)\n\n**Step 6:**\n- Box 123: Use lifters [3, 2, 0] (198 + 153 + 100 = 451)\n- Box 107: Use lifters [4, 5, 6] (118 + 100 + 153 = 371)\n- Box 97: Use lifters [1, 2, 3] (70 + 149 + 198 = 417)\n\n**Step 7:**\n- Box 77: Use lifters [3, 2, 0] (198 + 153 + 100 = 451)\n- Box 72: Use lifters [4, 5, 6] (118 + 100 + 153 = 371)\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 7 steps, using the available lifters optimally.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(397, [3, 2, 0]), (392, [4, 5, 6]), (385, [1, 2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(371, [3, 2, 0]), (357, [4, 5, 6]), (343, [1, 2, 3])]\nStep 3: [(303, [3, 2, 0]), (291, [4, 5, 6]), (277, [1, 2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(241, [3, 2, 0]), (231, [4, 5, 6]), (190, [1, 2, 3])]\nStep 5: [(173, [3, 2, 0]), (147, [4, 5, 6]), (138, [1, 2, 3])]\nStep 6: [(123, [3, 2, 0]), (107, [4, 5, 6]), (97, [1, 2, 3])]\nStep 7: [(77, [3, 2, 0]), (72, [4, 5, 6])]\n>>>"
