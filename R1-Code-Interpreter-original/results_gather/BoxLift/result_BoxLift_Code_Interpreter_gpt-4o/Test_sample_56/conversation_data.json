    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints. Let's work through the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available boxes to the available lifters, combining lifters if necessary to lift a single box.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 5.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [21, 25, 138, 168, 105, 127, 154, 55, 155, 125, 121, 58]\nlifters = [78, 98, 51, 75, 43]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 5:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters.copy()\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        combo = find_lifter_combination(box, available_lifters)\n        if combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in combo]))\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the given constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(168, [0, 1]), (155, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(154, [0, 1]), (138, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(127, [0, 1]), (125, [2, 3]), (25, [4])]\nStep 4: [(121, [0, 1]), (105, [2, 3]), (21, [4])]\nStep 5: [(58, [0]), (55, [1])]\n>>>\n\nIn each step, the lifters are assigned to lift the boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in 5 steps or fewer, with each lifter used only once per step."
