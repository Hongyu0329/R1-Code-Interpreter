    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes that require multiple lifters to lift.\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: Assign lifters to boxes, ensuring that the total lifting capacity of the assigned lifters meets or exceeds the weight of the box.\n3. **Optimize Steps**: Try to lift as many boxes as possible in each step, using the available lifters efficiently.\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy to find the optimal solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [14, 13, 59, 47, 73, 64, 58, 75]\nlifters = [74, 57, 51]\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, lifters):\n    # Check all combinations of lifters to find a valid one\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return []\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes in steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    remaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n    \n    while remaining_boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = set()\n        \n        for box_weight in sorted(remaining_boxes, reverse=True):\n            available_lifters = [(i, cap) for i, cap in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n            lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n            \n            if lifter_indices:\n                step.append((box_weight, lifter_indices))\n                used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n        \n        # Remove lifted boxes from the list\n        for box_weight, _ in step:\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box_weight)\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n    \n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps for lifting all boxes\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\nsteps\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the code due to incorrect handling of the lifter capacities.
