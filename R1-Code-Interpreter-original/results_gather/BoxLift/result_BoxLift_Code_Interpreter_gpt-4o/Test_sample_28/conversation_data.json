    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We will use a greedy approach to achieve this, where we try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n3. Use the lifters with the highest capacities first to lift the heaviest boxes.\n4.
