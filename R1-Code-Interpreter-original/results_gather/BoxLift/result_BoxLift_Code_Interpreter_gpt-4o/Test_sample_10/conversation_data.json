    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints of lifter capacities and the ability to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the heaviest boxes**: Start by assigning lifters to the heaviest boxes first, as they are the most challenging to lift.\n\n2. **Combine lifters if necessary**: If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Use lifters efficiently**: Try to use the lifters in such a way that maximizes the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n\n4. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy to find the optimal solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nbox_weights = [41, 31, 60, 20, 11, 26, 52, 98]\nlifter_capacities = [49, 55, 63]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nsorted_boxes = sorted(enumerate(box_weights), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nsorted_lifters = sorted(enumerate(lifter_capacities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Try to find a single lifter\n    for i, (lifter_index, capacity) in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if capacity >= box_weight:\n            return [lifter_index], available_lifters[:i] + available_lifters[i+1:]\n    \n    # Try to find a combination of lifters\n    for i, (lifter_index1, capacity1) in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        for j, (lifter_index2, capacity2) in enumerate(available_lifters[i+1:], start=i+1):\n            if capacity1 + capacity2 >= box_weight:\n                return [lifter_index1, lifter_index2], available_lifters[:i] + available_lifters[i+1:j] + available_lifters[j+1:]\n    \n    return None, available_lifters\n\n# Lift boxes in steps\nwhile sorted_boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = sorted_lifters.copy()\n    \n    for box_index, box_weight in sorted_boxes[:]:\n        lifters, available_lifters = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n        if lifters is not None:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifters))\n            sorted_boxes.remove((box_index, box_weight))\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > The boxes can be lifted in the following steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(98, [2, 1]), (41, [0])]\nStep 2: [(60, [2]), (52, [1]), (31, [0])]\nStep 3: [(26, [2]), (20, [1]), (11, [0])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution uses 3 steps, which is within the limit of 4 steps, and efficiently utilizes the lifters to lift all the boxes."
