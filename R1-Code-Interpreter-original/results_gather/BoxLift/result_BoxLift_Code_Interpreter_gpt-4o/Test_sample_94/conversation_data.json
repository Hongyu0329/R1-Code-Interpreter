    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by strategically combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and using individual lifters for lighter boxes when possible.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by:\n   - Assigning individual lifters to boxes they can lift alone.\n   - Combining lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n4.
