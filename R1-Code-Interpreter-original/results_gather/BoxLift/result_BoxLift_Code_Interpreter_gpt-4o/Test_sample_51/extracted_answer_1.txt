It seems there was an issue with the implementation, as no boxes were assigned to any steps. Let's debug and correct the approach to ensure that the boxes are being assigned correctly to the lifters. 

I'll revise the logic to ensure that lifters are correctly assigned to boxes, and that the steps are being populated as expected. Let's try this again.

# Re-implement the logic to assign lifters to boxes
# Initialize the steps
steps = []

# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box
def find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):
    used_lifters = []
    remaining_weight = box_weight
    for i, capacity in enumerate(available_lifters):
        if capacity <= remaining_weight:
            used_lifters.append(i)
            remaining_weight -= capacity
        if remaining_weight <= 0:
            break
    if remaining_weight > 0:
        return None  # Not possible to lift this box with available lifters
    return used_lifters

# Try to lift all boxes in 5 or fewer steps
for _ in range(5):
    step = []
    available_lifters = lifters.copy()
    for box in boxes[:]:
        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)
        if lifter_indices is not None:
            step.append((box, lifter_indices))
            # Remove used lifters from available lifters
            for index in sorted(lifter_indices, reverse=True):
                available_lifters.pop(index)
            # Remove the box from the list
            boxes.remove(box)
    steps.append(step)
    if not boxes:
        break
