    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints. Let's work through the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters or combinations of lifters to each box. Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [94, 177, 88, 131, 87, 113, 148, 86, 141, 83, 86, 73]\nlifters = [55, 92, 35, 48, 96]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        available_lifters = [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifter_combo = find_lifter_combination(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            used_lifters.update(lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the given constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(177, [0, 1]), (131, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(148, [0, 1]), (113, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(141, [0, 1]), (94, [2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(88, [0]), (87, [1]), (86, [2, 3])]\nStep 5: [(86, [0]), (83, [1]), (73, [2, 3])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution lifts all the boxes in 5 steps, which is within the allowed 6 steps.
