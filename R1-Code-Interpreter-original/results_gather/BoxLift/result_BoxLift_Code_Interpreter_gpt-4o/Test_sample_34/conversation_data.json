    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by using a greedy approach, where we try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of their weights.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of the boxes that have been lifted and the lifters that have been used in each step.\n5.
