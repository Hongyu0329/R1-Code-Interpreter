    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the constraints. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [196, 90, 142, 22, 143, 101, 43, 166, 79, 129, 77, 187]\nlifters = [71, 58, 104, 105]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return list(combo)\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 6:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters.copy()\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n            for lifter in lifter_indices:\n                available_lifters.remove(lifter)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here's the solution to lift all the boxes in 6 steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(196, [105, 104]), (129, [71, 58])]\nStep 2: [(187, [105, 104]), (101, [71, 58])]\nStep 3: [(166, [105, 104]), (90, [71, 58])]\nStep 4: [(143, [105, 104]), (79, [71, 58])]\nStep 5: [(142, [105, 104]), (77, [71, 58])]\nStep 6: [(43, [105]), (22, [104])]\n>>>\n\nIn each step, the lifters are combined as needed to lift the heaviest boxes first, ensuring that all boxes are lifted within the 6-step limit."
