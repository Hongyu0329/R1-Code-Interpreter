    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes and see if they can be lifted by a single lifter or if they require multiple lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: Assign lifters to boxes in a way that maximizes the number of boxes lifted in each step. Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in subsequent steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this strategy to find the optimal solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nbox_weights = [14, 51, 14, 69, 77, 20, 52, 96]\nlifter_capacities = [69, 66, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nsorted_boxes = sorted(enumerate(box_weights), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nsorted_lifters = sorted(enumerate(lifter_capacities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    used_lifters = []\n    remaining_weight = box_weight\n    for lifter_index, lifter_capacity in available_lifters:\n        if lifter_capacity >= remaining_weight:\n            used_lifters.append(lifter_index)\n            return used_lifters\n        elif lifter_capacity > 0:\n            used_lifters.append(lifter_index)\n            remaining_weight -= lifter_capacity\n    return used_lifters if remaining_weight <= 0 else None\n\n# Lift boxes in steps\nwhile sorted_boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = sorted_lifters.copy()\n    for box_index, box_weight in sorted_boxes[:]:\n        lifters_for_box = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n        if lifters_for_box:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifters_for_box))\n            sorted_boxes.remove((box_index, box_weight))\n            # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n            available_lifters = [lifter for lifter in available_lifters if lifter[0] not in lifters_for_box]\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the optimal solution to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(96, [2, 0]), (52, [1])]\nStep 2: [(77, [2, 0]), (51, [1])]\nStep 3: [(69, [2]), (20, [0]), (14, [1])]\nStep 4: [(14, [2])]\n>>>\n\nIn this solution:\n- In Step 1, lifters 2 and 0 combine to lift the 96 kg box, and lifter 1 lifts the 52 kg box.\n- In Step 2, lifters 2 and 0 combine to lift the 77 kg box, and lifter 1 lifts the 51 kg box.\n- In Step 3, lifter 2 lifts the 69 kg box, lifter 0 lifts the 20 kg box, and lifter 1 lifts the 14 kg box.\n- In Step 4, lifter 2 lifts the remaining 14 kg box.\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 4 steps or fewer, adhering to the constraints provided."
