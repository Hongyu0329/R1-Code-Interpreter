    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by attempting to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are the most challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters**: For each step, assign lifters to boxes based on their lifting capacities. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nbox_weights = [82, 61, 91, 29, 20, 43, 57, 79]\nlifter_capacities = [49, 80, 79]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nsorted_boxes = sorted(enumerate(box_weights), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nsorted_lifters = sorted(enumerate(lifter_capacities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    used_lifters = []\n    remaining_weight = box_weight\n    for index, capacity in available_lifters:\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            break\n        if capacity <= remaining_weight:\n            used_lifters.append(index)\n            remaining_weight -= capacity\n    return used_lifters if remaining_weight <= 0 else None\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in 4 steps or less\nfor _ in range(4):\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = sorted_lifters.copy()\n    for box_index, box_weight in sorted_boxes:\n        lifters = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n        if lifters is not None:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifters))\n            # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n            available_lifters = [l for l in available_lifters if l[0] not in lifters]\n    if step:\n        steps.append(step)\n        # Remove lifted boxes from the list\n        sorted_boxes = [b for b in sorted_boxes if b[0] not in [x[0] for x in step]]\n    if not sorted_boxes:\n        break\n\nsteps\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the logic, as the solution did not correctly assign lifters to boxes.
