    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by attempting to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are the most challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, assign lifters to boxes such that the total weight lifted by the lifters does not exceed their combined capacities. Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this strategy to find the optimal solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nbox_weights = [92, 26, 84, 55, 72, 48, 33, 19]\nlifter_capacities = [64, 48, 63]\n\n# Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nsorted_boxes = sorted(enumerate(box_weights), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Sort the lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nsorted_lifters = sorted(enumerate(lifter_capacities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Try to find a single lifter who can lift the box\n    for i, (lifter_index, capacity) in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if capacity >= box_weight:\n            return [lifter_index], available_lifters[:i] + available_lifters[i+1:]\n    \n    # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n    for i, (lifter_index1, capacity1) in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        for j, (lifter_index2, capacity2) in enumerate(available_lifters[i+1:], start=i+1):\n            if capacity1 + capacity2 >= box_weight:\n                return [lifter_index1, lifter_index2], available_lifters[:i] + available_lifters[i+1:j] + available_lifters[j+1:]\n    \n    return None, available_lifters\n\n# Lift the boxes in steps\nwhile sorted_boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = sorted_lifters.copy()\n    \n    for box_index, box_weight in sorted_boxes[:]:\n        lifters, available_lifters = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n        if lifters is not None:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifters))\n            sorted_boxes.remove((box_index, box_weight))\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > The boxes can be lifted in the following steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(92, [0, 2]), (48, [1])]\nStep 2: [(84, [0, 2]), (33, [1])]\nStep 3: [(72, [0, 2]), (26, [1])]\nStep 4: [(55, [0]), (19, [2])]\n>>>\n\nIn each step, the lifters are assigned to lift the boxes such that all constraints are satisfied, and all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps."
