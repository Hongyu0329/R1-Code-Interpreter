    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by strategically combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and using individual lifters for lighter boxes when possible.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this strategy:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# List of box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [289, 375, 107, 145, 257, 48, 141, 83, 136, 368, 59, 133, 186, 266, 353, 73, 66, 210, 247, 79, 342, 318, 337, 162]\nlifters = [75, 189, 162, 181, 118, 194, 137]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        combo = find_lifter_combination(box, available_lifters)\n        if combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in combo]))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(375, [0, 1]), (368, [2, 3, 4]), (186, [5, 6])]\nStep 2: [(353, [0, 1]), (342, [2, 3]), (318, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 3: [(337, [0, 1]), (289, [2, 3]), (266, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 4: [(257, [0, 1]), (247, [2, 3]), (210, [4, 5]), (73, [6])]\nStep 5: [(162, [0]), (145, [1]), (141, [2]), (136, [3]), (133, [4]), (107, [5]), (66, [6])]\nStep 6: [(83, [0]), (79, [1]), (59, [2]), (48, [3])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution lifts all the boxes in 6 steps, which is within the limit of 7 steps."
