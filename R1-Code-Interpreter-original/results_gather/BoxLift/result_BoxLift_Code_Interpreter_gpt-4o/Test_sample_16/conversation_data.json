    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by strategically combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensuring that each lifter is used optimally in each step.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try and lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 5.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [166, 194, 27, 144, 198, 172, 81, 117, 154, 183, 27, 184]\nlifters = [97, 90, 80, 111, 76]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 5:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        available_lifters = [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            used_lifters.update(lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, following the given rules:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(198, [0, 1]), (194, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(184, [0, 1]), (183, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(172, [0, 1]), (166, [2, 3]), (27, [4])]\nStep 4: [(154, [0, 1]), (144, [2, 3]), (27, [4])]\nStep 5: [(117, [0, 1]), (81, [2])]\n>>>\n\nIn each step, the lifters are combined optimally to lift the heaviest boxes possible, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 5 steps or fewer."
