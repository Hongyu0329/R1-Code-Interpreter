    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by strategically combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and using individual lifters for lighter boxes when possible.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help us prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this strategy:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [86, 183, 78, 85, 112, 170, 130, 121, 208, 226, 39, 176, 68, 256, 56, 34]\nlifters = [116, 81, 149, 77, 138]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifters[:]\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n            for i, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n                if lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [i]))\n                    available_lifters.pop(i)\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # If no single lifter can lift the box, try to combine lifters\n                combined_lifters = []\n                total_capacity = 0\n                for i, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n                    combined_lifters.append(i)\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        step.append((box, combined_lifters))\n                        for index in sorted(combined_lifters, reverse=True):\n                            available_lifters.pop(index)\n                        boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n        steps.append(step)\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps to lift all boxes\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(256, [0, 1]), (226, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(208, [0, 1]), (183, [0, 1]), (68, [0])]\nStep 3: [(176, [0, 1]), (170, [0, 1]), (56, [0])]\nStep 4: [(130, [0]), (121, [0]), (112, [0]), (86, [0, 1])]\nStep 5: [(85, [0]), (78, [0]), (39, [0]), (34, [0])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution uses a total of 5 steps, which is within the limit of 6 steps.
