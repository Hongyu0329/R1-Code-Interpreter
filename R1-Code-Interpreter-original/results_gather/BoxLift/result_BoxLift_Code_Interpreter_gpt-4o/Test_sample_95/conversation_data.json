    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We will consider the constraints and rules provided, and attempt to find an optimal solution.\n\nLet's break down the problem and find a solution step by step:\n\n1. **Step 1**: We will try to lift the heaviest boxes first, using the available lifters. We can combine lifters to lift a single box if necessary.\n\n2. **Step 2**: After lifting the heaviest boxes, we will proceed to lift the remaining boxes using the available lifters.\n\n3. **Step 3**: If there are any boxes left, we will lift them in this step.\n\nLet's calculate the solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [79, 48, 16, 95, 67, 41, 62, 22]\nlifters = [52, 41, 41, 67]\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return None\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes in steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    remaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n    \n    while remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 3:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = set()\n        \n        for box_weight in sorted(remaining_boxes, reverse=True):\n            available_lifters = [(i, cap) for i, cap in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n            lifter_indices = find_lifter_combination(box_weight, available_lifters)\n            \n            if lifter_indices is not None:\n                step.append((box_weight, lifter_indices))\n                used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n        \n        # Remove lifted boxes from remaining_boxes\n        for box_weight, _ in step:\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box_weight)\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n    \n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps for lifting all boxes\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\nsteps\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the code due to incorrect handling of the available lifters' data structure.
