    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by strategically combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and using individual lifters for lighter boxes. Let's work through the solution step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters:**\n   - Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n   - Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes:**\n   - For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes.\n   - If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n   - Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes are Lifted:**\n   - Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [299, 338, 270, 207, 76, 195, 101, 89, 277, 236, 240, 342, 47, 207, 220, 349, 185, 124, 309, 112, 266, 278, 162, 119]\nlifters = [198, 55, 76, 137, 163, 117, 146]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        available_lifters = [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifter_combo = find_lifter_combination(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            used_lifters.update(lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(349, [0, 1]), (342, [2, 3, 4]), (124, [5, 6])]\nStep 2: [(338, [0, 1]), (309, [2, 3, 4]), (119, [5, 6])]\nStep 3: [(299, [0, 1]), (278, [2, 3]), (240, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 4: [(277, [0, 1]), (270, [2, 3]), (236, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 5: [(266, [0, 1]), (220, [2, 3]), (207, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 6: [(207, [0, 1]), (195, [2, 3]), (185, [4, 5]), (47, [6])]\nStep 7: [(162, [0]), (112, [1]), (101, [2]), (89, [3]), (76, [4])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution lifts all the boxes in 7 steps, which is within the limit of 8 steps. Each step efficiently utilizes the available lifters to lift the heaviest possible boxes."
