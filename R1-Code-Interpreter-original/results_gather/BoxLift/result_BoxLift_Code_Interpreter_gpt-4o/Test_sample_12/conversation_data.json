    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to efficiently assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first by combining lifters if necessary. Use a greedy approach to assign the available lifters to the heaviest boxes they can lift.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 12.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [50, 219, 120, 245, 204, 172, 274, 225, 94, 270, 158, 253, 174, 40, 252, 124]\nlifters = [54, 61, 106, 60, 63]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in lifter_combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution for lifting all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible, while adhering to the constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(274, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (50, [4])]\nStep 2: [(270, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (40, [4])]\nStep 3: [(253, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(252, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 5: [(245, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 6: [(225, [0, 1, 2]), (94, [3, 4])]\nStep 7: [(219, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 8: [(204, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 9: [(174, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 10: [(172, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 11: [(158, [0, 1]), (124, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 12: [(120, [0, 1])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 12 steps or fewer, using the available lifters efficiently."
