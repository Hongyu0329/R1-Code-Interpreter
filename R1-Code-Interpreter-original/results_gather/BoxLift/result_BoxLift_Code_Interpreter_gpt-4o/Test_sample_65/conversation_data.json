    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We will consider the constraints and try to optimize the solution.\n\nLet's break down the problem and find a solution:\n\n1. **Step 1**: Start by lifting the heaviest boxes that can be lifted by combining the available lifters.\n2. **Step 2**: Continue lifting the remaining boxes, again prioritizing the heaviest boxes.\n3. **Step 3**: Lift any remaining boxes.\n\nWe'll use a greedy approach to assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest boxes and using the strongest available lifters.
