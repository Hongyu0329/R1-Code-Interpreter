  "question": "Task: BoxLift\n\nYou are given a list of boxes with the following weights: [55, 244, 173, 293, 90, 126, 340, 250, 66, 143, 103, 244, 76, 166, 130, 216, 54, 196, 245, 307]\nAnd a list of lifters with the following maximum lifting capacities: [142, 178, 196, 52, 101, 144, 50]\n\nYour task is to assign the lifters to lift all the boxes in multiple steps, following these rules:\n1. Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step.\n2. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n3. Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step.\n4. Multiple lifters can combine together to lift one box if the box is too heavy for a single lifter.\n5. Try to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible.\n6. You need to lift all the boxes in less than or equal to 6 steps.\n\nPlease provide your solution in the following format:\nStep 1: [(Box weight, [Lifter indices]), (Box weight, [Lifter indices]), ...]\nStep 2: [(Box weight, [Lifter indices]), (Box weight, [Lifter indices]), ...]\n...\n\nFor example:\nStep 1: [(50, [0, 2]), (30, [1]), (20, [3])]\nThis means in Step 1, lifters 0 and 2 are lifting a box weighing 50, lifter 1 is lifting a box weighing 30, and lifter 3 is lifting a box weighing 20.\n\nSurround the answer with <<<content>>>.\n\nFor example, <<<Step 1: [(50, [0, 2]), (30, [1]), (20, [3])]\nStep 2: [(40, [0, 1]), (20, [2]), (20, [3])]\nStep 3:...>>>\n\nEnsure all boxes are lifted and provide the most efficient solution possible.\n\nYour answer:\n\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints of the lifters' capacities and the possibility of combining lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nLet's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination.\n4.

    "Task: BoxLift\n\nYou are given a list of boxes with the following weights: [55, 244, 173, 293, 90, 126, 340, 250, 66, 143, 103, 244, 76, 166, 130, 216, 54, 196, 245, 307]\nAnd a list of lifters with the following maximum lifting capacities: [142, 178, 196, 52, 101, 144, 50]\n\nYour task is to assign the lifters to lift all the boxes in multiple steps, following these rules:\n1. Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step.\n2. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n3. Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step.\n4. Multiple lifters can combine together to lift one box if the box is too heavy for a single lifter.\n5. Try to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible.\n6. You need to lift all the boxes in less than or equal to 6 steps.\n\nPlease provide your solution in the following format:\nStep 1: [(Box weight, [Lifter indices]), (Box weight, [Lifter indices]), ...]\nStep 2: [(Box weight, [Lifter indices]), (Box weight, [Lifter indices]), ...]\n...\n\nFor example:\nStep 1: [(50, [0, 2]), (30, [1]), (20, [3])]\nThis means in Step 1, lifters 0 and 2 are lifting a box weighing 50, lifter 1 is lifting a box weighing 30, and lifter 3 is lifting a box weighing 20.\n\nSurround the answer with <<<content>>>.\n\nFor example, <<<Step 1: [(50, [0, 2]), (30, [1]), (20, [3])]\nStep 2: [(40, [0, 1]), (20, [2]), (20, [3])]\nStep 3:...>>>\n\nEnsure all boxes are lifted and provide the most efficient solution possible.\n\nYour answer:\n\n"
