    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes that need multiple lifters to be lifted.\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: Assign lifters to boxes, ensuring that the total lifting capacity of the assigned lifters meets or exceeds the weight of the box.\n3. **Optimize Steps**: Try to lift as many boxes as possible in each step by efficiently utilizing the available lifters.\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy to find the optimal solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [17, 69, 16, 83, 95, 91, 68, 25]\nlifters = [42, 68, 50, 48]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box weight\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Check all combinations of available lifters\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes in steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifters[:]\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n            if lifter_combo:\n                step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n                boxes.remove(box)\n                for l in lifter_combo:\n                    available_lifters.remove(l)\n        steps.append(step)\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps for lifting all boxes\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\nsteps\nassistant > The solution to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps is as follows:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(95, [0, 1]), (91, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(83, [0, 1]), (69, [2, 3])]\nStep 3: [(68, [1]), (25, [0]), (17, [2]), (16, [3])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 3 steps, which is within the allowed 4 steps, and each step utilizes the available lifters efficiently."
