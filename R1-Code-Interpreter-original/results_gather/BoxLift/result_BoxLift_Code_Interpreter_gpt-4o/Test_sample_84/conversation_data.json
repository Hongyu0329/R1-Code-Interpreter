    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by strategically combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensuring that we use the maximum capacity of the lifters in each step.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution by implementing a strategy to assign lifters to boxes. We'll aim to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are more challenging to lift and require more lifters. We'll also ensure that the total weight lifted in each step is maximized by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\nLet's calculate the solution step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# List of box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [281, 159, 239, 61, 219, 44, 225, 192, 74, 369, 318, 366, 62, 186, 373, 243, 131, 172, 66, 167, 400, 330, 351, 245]\nlifters = [164, 182, 169, 127, 118, 60]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a given box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, weights = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(weights) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return None\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifter_combination(box, [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters])\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the logic, as the solution is not optimal and doesn't fit within the 9-step constraint.
