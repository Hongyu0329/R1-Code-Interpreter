    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. Let's work through the solution step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by identifying the heaviest boxes that require multiple lifters to lift.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: Assign lifters to boxes, ensuring that the total lifting capacity of the assigned lifters meets or exceeds the weight of the box.\n\n3. **Optimize Steps**: Try to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nbox_weights = [18, 27, 65, 31, 60, 73, 30, 67]\nlifter_capacities = [66, 72, 43]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nsorted_boxes = sorted(enumerate(box_weights), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nsorted_lifters = sorted(enumerate(lifter_capacities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    used_lifters = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n    for lifter_index, capacity in available_lifters:\n        if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n            break\n        used_lifters.append(lifter_index)\n        total_capacity += capacity\n    if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n        return used_lifters\n    return None\n\n# Lift boxes in steps\nwhile sorted_boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = sorted_lifters.copy()\n    remaining_boxes = []\n    \n    for box_index, box_weight in sorted_boxes:\n        lifters = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n        if lifters is not None:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifters))\n            # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n            available_lifters = [l for l in available_lifters if l[0] not in lifters]\n        else:\n            remaining_boxes.append((box_index, box_weight))\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n    sorted_boxes = remaining_boxes\n\nsteps\nassistant > The boxes can be lifted in the following steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(73, [1, 0]), (31, [2])]\nStep 2: [(67, [1]), (65, [0]), (30, [2])]\nStep 3: [(60, [1]), (27, [0]), (18, [2])]\n>>>\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Box weighing 73 is lifted by lifters 1 and 0.\n  - Box weighing 31 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 2**: \n  - Box weighing 67 is lifted by lifter 1.\n  - Box weighing 65 is lifted by lifter 0.\n  - Box weighing 30 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 3**: \n  - Box weighing 60 is lifted by lifter 1.\n  - Box weighing 27 is lifted by lifter 0.\n  - Box weighing 18 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\nThis solution lifts all the boxes in 3 steps, which is within the allowed 4 steps."
