    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints of each lifter's maximum capacity and the possibility of combining lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nLet's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Given data\nboxes = [161, 400, 306, 233, 179, 305, 284, 214, 288, 132, 387, 198, 274, 40, 392, 183, 275, 259, 67, 177]\nlifters = [122, 116, 51, 165, 95, 150, 179]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 7:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifter_combination(box, [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters])\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > The solution involves lifting the boxes in the following steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(400, [0, 1, 2]), (306, [0, 1, 2]), (305, [0, 1, 2]), (288, [0, 1, 2]), (284, [0, 1, 2]), (275, [0, 1, 2]), (274, [0, 1, 2]), (259, [0, 1, 2]), (233, [0, 1]), (214, [0, 1]), (198, [0, 1]), (183, [0, 1]), (179, [0, 1]), (177, [0, 1]), (161, [0, 1]), (132, [0, 1]), (67, [0]), (40, [0])]\nStep 2: [(392, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 3: [(387, [0, 1, 2])]\n>>>\n\nIn this solution, the lifters are combined to lift the heaviest boxes first, and the process is repeated until all boxes are lifted.
