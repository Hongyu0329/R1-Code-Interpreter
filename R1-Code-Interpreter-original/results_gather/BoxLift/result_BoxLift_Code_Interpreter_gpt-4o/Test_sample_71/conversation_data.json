    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We will use a greedy approach to achieve this, where we try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of their weights.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [156, 123, 139, 191, 91, 193, 100, 47, 36, 169, 90, 117]\nlifters = [52, 55, 63, 44]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in lifter_combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(193, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(191, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 3: [(169, [0, 1, 2]), (36, [3])]\nStep 4: [(156, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 5: [(139, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 6: [(123, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 7: [(117, [0, 1]), (91, [2, 3])]\nStep 8: [(100, [0, 1]), (90, [2, 3])]\nStep 9: [(47, [0])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 9 steps or fewer, using the available lifters efficiently."
