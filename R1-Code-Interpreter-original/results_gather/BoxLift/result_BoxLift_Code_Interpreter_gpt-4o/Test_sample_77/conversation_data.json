    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We can achieve this by strategically combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensuring that all lifters are utilized efficiently in each step.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n1.
