    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to efficiently assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, while adhering to the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first by combining the strongest available lifters. If a single lifter can lift a box, assign it directly. Otherwise, combine lifters to match or exceed the box's weight.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 11.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given data\nboxes = [215, 113, 62, 255, 246, 148, 283, 149, 295, 250, 114, 48, 245, 145, 153, 50]\nlifters = [82, 55, 159, 56, 88]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order with their indices\nlifters_with_indices = sorted([(capacity, index) for index, capacity in enumerate(lifters)], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    used_lifters = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n    for capacity, index in available_lifters:\n        if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n            break\n        used_lifters.append(index)\n        total_capacity += capacity\n    if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n        return used_lifters\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters_with_indices.copy()\n    for box_weight in boxes[:]:\n        lifters_for_box = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n        if lifters_for_box:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifters_for_box))\n            boxes.remove(box_weight)\n            # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n            available_lifters = [lifter for lifter in available_lifters if lifter[1] not in lifters_for_box]\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(295, [2, 4, 0]), (62, [3, 1])]\nStep 2: [(283, [2, 4, 0]), (50, [3]), (48, [1])]\nStep 3: [(255, [2, 4, 0])]\nStep 4: [(250, [2, 4, 0])]\nStep 5: [(246, [2, 4]), (153, [0, 3, 1])]\nStep 6: [(245, [2, 4]), (149, [0, 3, 1])]\nStep 7: [(215, [2, 4]), (148, [0, 3, 1])]\nStep 8: [(145, [2]), (114, [4, 0])]\nStep 9: [(113, [2])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 9 steps, which is within the limit of 11 steps. Each step efficiently utilizes the available lifters to lift the heaviest possible boxes."
