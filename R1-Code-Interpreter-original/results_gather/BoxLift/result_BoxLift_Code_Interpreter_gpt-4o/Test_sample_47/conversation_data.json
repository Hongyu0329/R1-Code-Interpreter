  "question": "Task: BoxLift\n\nYou are given a list of boxes with the following weights: [280, 32, 168, 120, 112, 285, 46, 33, 148, 74, 295, 279, 207, 138, 153, 63]\nAnd a list of lifters with the following maximum lifting capacities: [53, 92, 104, 86, 106, 68]\n\nYour task is to assign the lifters to lift all the boxes in multiple steps, following these rules:\n1. Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step.\n2. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n3. Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step.\n4. Multiple lifters can combine together to lift one box if the box is too heavy for a single lifter.\n5. Try to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible.\n6. You need to lift all the boxes in less than or equal to 6 steps.\n\nPlease provide your solution in the following format:\nStep 1: [(Box weight, [Lifter indices]), (Box weight, [Lifter indices]), ...]\nStep 2: [(Box weight, [Lifter indices]), (Box weight, [Lifter indices]), ...]\n...\n\nFor example:\nStep 1: [(50, [0, 2]), (30, [1]), (20, [3])]\nThis means in Step 1, lifters 0 and 2 are lifting a box weighing 50, lifter 1 is lifting a box weighing 30, and lifter 3 is lifting a box weighing 20.\n\nSurround the answer with <<<content>>>.\n\nFor example, <<<Step 1: [(50, [0, 2]), (30, [1]), (20, [3])]\nStep 2: [(40, [0, 1]), (20, [2]), (20, [3])]\nStep 3:...>>>\n\nEnsure all boxes are lifted and provide the most efficient solution possible.\n\nYour answer:\n\n",
