    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their lifting capacities.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination, ensuring that the total weight lifted by the lifters matches or exceeds the box weight.\n4.
