    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We will follow the rules provided and try to optimize the solution.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combination of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest boxes to the available lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Given data\nboxes = [21, 96, 83, 73, 100, 73, 55, 25]\nlifters = [62, 79, 54]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, lifters):\n    # Check all combinations of lifters\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifter_combination(box, [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters])\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(100, [0, 1]), (25, [0]), (21, [0])]\nStep 2: [(96, [0, 1])]\nStep 3: [(83, [0, 1])]\nStep 4: [(73, [0]), (73, [0, 1])]\nStep 5: [(55, [0])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution uses a total of 5 steps, which is within the allowed 6 steps.
