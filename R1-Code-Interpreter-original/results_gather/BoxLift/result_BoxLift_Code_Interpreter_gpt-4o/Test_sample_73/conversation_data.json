    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We will use a greedy approach to achieve this, where we try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of their weights.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities.\n3.
