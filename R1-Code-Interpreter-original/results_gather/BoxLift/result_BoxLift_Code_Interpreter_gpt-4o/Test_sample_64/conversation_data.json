Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step.\n2. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n3. Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step.\n4. Multiple lifters can combine together to lift one box if the box is too heavy for a single lifter.\n5. Try to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible.\n6.
