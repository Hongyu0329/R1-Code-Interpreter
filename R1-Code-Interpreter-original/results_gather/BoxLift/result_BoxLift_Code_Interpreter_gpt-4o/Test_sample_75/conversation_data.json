    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We will consider the constraints and try to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the heaviest boxes**: We need to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first, as they require more lifters or stronger lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: We will assign lifters to boxes based on their lifting capacities, ensuring that the total capacity of the assigned lifters meets or exceeds the weight of the box.\n\n3. **Optimize the number of steps**: We will try to lift as many boxes as possible in each step, using the available lifters efficiently.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Given data\nbox_weights = [76, 97, 14, 30, 36, 83, 45, 46]\nlifter_capacities = [69, 59, 68, 50]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order of weight\nsorted_boxes = sorted(enumerate(box_weights), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order of capacity\nsorted_lifters = sorted(enumerate(lifter_capacities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters that can lift a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(lifter_capacities[i] for i in combo) >= box_weight:\n                return list(combo)\n    return []\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = sorted_boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 3:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box_index, box_weight in remaining_boxes:\n        available_lifters = [i for i, _ in sorted_lifters if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifters = find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters)\n        if lifters:\n            step.append((box_weight, lifters))\n            used_lifters.update(lifters)\n    \n    # Remove lifted boxes from the list\n    remaining_boxes = [box for box in remaining_boxes if box[1] not in [b[0] for b in step]]\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > The boxes can be lifted in the following steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(97, [0, 2]), (83, [1, 3])]\nStep 2: [(76, [0, 2]), (46, [1]), (45, [3])]\nStep 3: [(36, [0]), (30, [2]), (14, [1])]\n>>>\n\nIn this solution:\n- In Step 1, lifters 0 and 2 combine to lift the 97 kg box, and lifters 1 and 3 combine to lift the 83 kg box.\n- In Step 2, lifters 0 and 2 combine to lift the 76 kg box, lifter 1 lifts the 46 kg box, and lifter 3 lifts the 45 kg box.\n- In Step 3, lifter 0 lifts the 36 kg box, lifter 2 lifts the 30 kg box, and lifter 1 lifts the 14 kg box.\n\nThis ensures all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible, adhering to the constraints."
