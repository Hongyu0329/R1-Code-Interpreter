    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\n4. **Ensure the number of steps is within the limit**: Make sure the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nboxes = [166, 144, 53, 213, 51, 156, 197, 311, 177, 358, 172, 134, 179, 145, 91, 188, 352, 294, 292, 88, 97, 394, 123, 294]\nlifters = [88, 185, 145, 195, 147, 145]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order with their indices\nlifters_with_indices = sorted([(capacity, index) for index, capacity in enumerate(lifters)], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    used_lifters = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n    for capacity, index in available_lifters:\n        if total_capacity < box_weight:\n            used_lifters.append(index)\n            total_capacity += capacity\n        if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n            break\n    if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n        return used_lifters\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters_with_indices.copy()\n    remaining_boxes = []\n    \n    for box in boxes:\n        lifters_for_box = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifters_for_box is not None:\n            step.append((box, lifters_for_box))\n            # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n            available_lifters = [lifter for lifter in available_lifters if lifter[1] not in lifters_for_box]\n        else:\n            remaining_boxes.append(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n    boxes = remaining_boxes\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the given constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(394, [3, 1, 4]), (358, [5, 2, 0])]\nStep 2: [(352, [3, 1]), (311, [4, 5, 2]), (88, [0])]\nStep 3: [(294, [3, 1]), (294, [4, 5, 2]), (53, [0])]\nStep 4: [(292, [3, 1]), (213, [4, 5]), (197, [2, 0])]\nStep 5: [(188, [3]), (179, [1]), (177, [4, 5]), (172, [2, 0])]\nStep 6: [(166, [3]), (156, [1]), (145, [4]), (144, [5]), (134, [2]), (51, [0])]\nStep 7: [(123, [3]), (97, [1]), (91, [4])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution lifts all the boxes in 7 steps, which is within the limit of 8 steps.
