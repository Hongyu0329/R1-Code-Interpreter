    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints of the lifters' capacities and the possibility of combining lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes in descending order**: This allows us to tackle the heaviest boxes first, which are more challenging to lift.\n2. **Sort the lifters in descending order**: This helps in efficiently using the strongest lifters first.\n3. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. **Combine lifters if necessary**: If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n5. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nboxes = [130, 182, 34, 60, 202, 148, 160, 265, 216, 93, 133, 245, 165, 104, 143, 220]\nlifters = [76, 78, 96, 122, 74, 80]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifters[:]\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n            for i, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n                if lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [i]))\n                    available_lifters.pop(i)\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try to combine lifters to lift the box\n                total_capacity = 0\n                lifter_indices = []\n                for i, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(i)\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        for index in sorted(lifter_indices, reverse=True):\n                            available_lifters.pop(index)\n                        boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n        steps.append(step)\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps to lift all boxes\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible, while adhering to the constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(265, [0, 1, 2]), (220, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 2: [(245, [0, 1, 2]), (216, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 3: [(202, [0, 1]), (182, [0, 1, 2]), (60, [0])]\nStep 4: [(165, [0, 1]), (160, [0, 1, 2]), (34, [0])]\nStep 5: [(148, [0, 1]), (143, [0, 1]), (133, [0, 1])]\nStep 6: [(130, [0, 1]), (104, [0, 1]), (93, [0, 1])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps, which is within the 7-step limit.
