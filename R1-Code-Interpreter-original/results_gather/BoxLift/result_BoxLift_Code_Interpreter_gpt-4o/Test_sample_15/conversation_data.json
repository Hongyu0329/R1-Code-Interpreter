    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps allowed. We will consider the constraints and try to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the problem and then proceed to find a solution. We'll use a greedy approach to assign the heaviest boxes first, utilizing the available lifters' capacities efficiently.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n3. Try to assign the heaviest available box to the available lifters, combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes and lifters until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Given data\nboxes = [50, 70, 83, 17, 21, 27, 53, 31]\nlifters = [42, 53, 74, 78]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Check all combinations of lifters to find a valid one\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes in steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    remaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n    \n    while remaining_boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifters[:]\n        \n        for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n            lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n            if lifter_combo:\n                step.append((box, lifter_combo))\n                remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n                for lifter in lifter_combo:\n                    available_lifters.remove(lifter)\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 3:\n            break\n    \n    return steps\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, using the given lifters:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(83, [3, 2]), (70, [1, 0])]\nStep 2: [(53, [3]), (50, [2]), (31, [1]), (27, [0])]\nStep 3: [(21, [3]), (17, [2])]\n>>>\n\nExplanation:\n- **Step 1**: The heaviest box (83) is lifted by lifters 3 and 2, and the next heaviest box (70) is lifted by lifters 1 and 0.\n- **Step 2**: The box weighing 53 is lifted by lifter 3, the box weighing 50 is lifted by lifter 2, the box weighing 31 is lifted by lifter 1, and the box weighing 27 is lifted by lifter 0.\n- **Step 3**: The box weighing 21 is lifted by lifter 3, and the box weighing 17 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 3 steps, adhering to the constraints provided."
