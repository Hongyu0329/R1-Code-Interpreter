    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We will consider the constraints and try to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's break down the problem and find a solution:\n\n1. **Step 1:**\n   - We will start by assigning the heaviest boxes to the available lifters, combining lifters if necessary.\n   - The heaviest box is 82, which requires multiple lifters to lift. We can combine lifters with capacities 76 and 78 to lift this box.\n   - Next, we can assign the lifter with a capacity of 63 to lift the box weighing 55.\n   - Finally, the lifter with a capacity of 46 can lift the box weighing 38.\n\n2. **Step 2:**\n   - After Step 1, the remaining boxes are 74, 43, 34, 20, and 11.\n   - We can assign the lifter with a capacity of 78 to lift the box weighing 74.\n   - The lifter with a capacity of 76 can lift the box weighing 43.\n   - The lifter with a capacity of 63 can lift the box weighing 34.\n   - The lifter with a capacity of 46 can lift the box weighing 20.\n\n3. **Step 3:**\n   - The only remaining box is 11, which can be lifted by any lifter. We can assign the lifter with a capacity of 46 to lift this box.\n\nLet's formalize this solution:\nassistant > <<<\nStep 1: [(82, [0, 1]), (55, [3]), (38, [2])]\nStep 2: [(74, [1]), (43, [0]), (34, [3]), (20, [2])]\nStep 3: [(11, [2])]\n>>>"
