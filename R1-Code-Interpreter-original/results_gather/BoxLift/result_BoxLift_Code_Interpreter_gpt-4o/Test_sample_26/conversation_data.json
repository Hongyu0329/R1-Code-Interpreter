    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [58, 45, 94, 26, 49, 153, 61, 23, 170, 143, 75, 166]\nlifters = [57, 61, 104, 98, 70]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 4:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters.copy()\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in lifter_combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the given constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(170, [0, 1]), (166, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(153, [0, 1]), (143, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(94, [0]), (75, [1]), (61, [2]), (58, [3]), (49, [4])]\nStep 4: [(45, [0]), (26, [1]), (23, [2])]\n>>>\n\nIn this solution:\n- In Step 1, lifters 0 and 1 combine to lift the box weighing 170, and lifters 2, 3, and 4 combine to lift the box weighing 166.\n- In Step 2, lifters 0 and 1 combine to lift the box weighing 153, and lifters 2, 3, and 4 combine to lift the box weighing 143.\n- In Step 3, each lifter lifts one box individually.\n- In Step 4, lifters 0, 1, and 2 lift the remaining boxes individually. \n\nThis ensures all boxes are lifted in 4 steps or less."
