    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the lifters to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, minimizing the number of steps. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first by assigning the available lifters. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nboxes = [12, 90, 67, 10, 10, 94, 60, 46]\nlifters = [56, 77, 72]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Try to find a single lifter who can lift the box\n    for i, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if lifter >= box_weight:\n            return [i], [lifter]\n    \n    # If no single lifter can lift the box, try combinations\n    for i in range(len(available_lifters)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(available_lifters)):\n            if available_lifters[i] + available_lifters[j] >= box_weight:\n                return [i, j], [available_lifters[i], available_lifters[j]]\n    \n    # If no combination can lift the box, return empty\n    return [], []\n\n# Lift boxes in steps\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    lifter_indices = list(range(len(lifters)))\n    \n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices_for_box, lifters_used = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        \n        if lifter_indices_for_box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices_for_box))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for index in sorted(lifter_indices_for_box, reverse=True):\n                del available_lifters[index]\n                del lifter_indices[index]\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, following the given rules:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(94, [0, 1]), (46, [0])]\nStep 2: [(90, [0, 1]), (12, [0])]\nStep 3: [(67, [0]), (60, [0]), (10, [0])]\nStep 4: [(10, [0])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 4 steps or less, using the available lifters efficiently."
