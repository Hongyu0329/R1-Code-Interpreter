    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We will consider the constraints and try to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help us efficiently assign the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\nWe'll then attempt to assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that the total capacity of the lifters assigned to a box is at least equal to the weight of the box. We'll repeat this process until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [24, 78, 95, 23, 57, 36, 40, 26]\nlifters = [56, 51, 66, 65]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters that can lift a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes in steps\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 3:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters.copy()\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in lifter_combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here's the solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(95, [0, 1]), (78, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(57, [0]), (40, [1]), (36, [2]), (26, [3])]\nStep 3: [(24, [0]), (23, [1])]\n>>>\n\nIn this solution:\n- In Step 1, lifters 0 and 1 combine to lift the 95 kg box, and lifters 2 and 3 combine to lift the 78 kg box.\n- In Step 2, each lifter lifts one box individually.\n- In Step 3, lifters 0 and 1 lift the remaining boxes individually. \n\nThis ensures all boxes are lifted in 3 steps, which is the maximum allowed."
