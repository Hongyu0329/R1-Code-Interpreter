    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination, ensuring that the total capacity of the assigned lifters meets or exceeds the box weight.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Given data\nboxes = [34, 92, 289, 35, 140, 174, 244, 136, 80, 252, 136, 181, 92, 235, 61, 286]\nlifters = [61, 60, 150, 96, 58, 91]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign lifters to boxes\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 6:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        available_lifters = [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            used_lifters.update(lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 6 steps or less:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(289, [0, 1, 2]), (174, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(286, [0, 1, 2]), (140, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 3: [(252, [0, 1, 2]), (136, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 4: [(244, [0, 1]), (235, [2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(181, [0, 1]), (136, [2, 3]), (92, [4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(92, [0]), (80, [1]), (61, [2]), (35, [3]), (34, [4])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted using the minimum number of steps, with each step utilizing the available lifters efficiently."
