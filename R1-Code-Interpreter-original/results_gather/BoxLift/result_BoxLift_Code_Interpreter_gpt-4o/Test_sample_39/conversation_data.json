    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We will use a greedy approach to achieve this, where we try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of their weights.\n2. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n3. Use the lifters with the highest capacities first to maximize the weight lifted in each step.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Given data\nboxes = [256, 53, 286, 205, 261, 209, 242, 143, 354, 55, 72, 161, 268, 305, 43, 246, 146, 331, 84, 128, 88, 358, 71, 93]\nlifters = [189, 58, 58, 79, 123, 192, 116]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order with their indices\nlifters_with_indices = sorted(enumerate(lifters), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(lifters[i] for i in combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters in steps\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = [i for i, _ in lifters_with_indices]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, list(lifter_combo)))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for i in lifter_combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(i)\n    steps.append(step)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(358, [5, 0]), (354, [4, 6, 3, 1]), (55, [2])]\nStep 2: [(331, [5, 0]), (305, [4, 6, 3]), (93, [1, 2])]\nStep 3: [(286, [5, 0]), (268, [4, 6, 3]), (88, [1, 2])]\nStep 4: [(261, [5, 0]), (256, [4, 6, 3]), (84, [1, 2])]\nStep 5: [(246, [5, 0]), (242, [4, 6, 3]), (72, [1, 2])]\nStep 6: [(209, [5, 0]), (205, [4, 6]), (161, [3, 1, 2])]\nStep 7: [(146, [5]), (143, [0]), (128, [4, 6]), (71, [3]), (53, [1]), (43, [2])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 7 steps, which is within the 8-step limit."
