    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the approach:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try and match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign lifters to boxes starting from the heaviest box. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this approach to find the solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Given data\nboxes = [57, 112, 121, 49, 166, 143, 169, 43, 90, 66, 23, 143]\nlifters = [103, 49, 95, 97, 98]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of steps to lift all boxes\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    remaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n    \n    while remaining_boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        \n        for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n            # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n            for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n                for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n                    indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n                    if sum(capacities) >= box and all(not used_lifters[i] for i in indices):\n                        step.append((box, list(indices)))\n                        for i in indices:\n                            used_lifters[i] = True\n                        remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 4:\n            break\n    \n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\nsteps\nassistant > Here is the solution to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the given constraints:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(169, [0, 1]), (166, [2, 3]), (49, [4])]\nStep 2: [(143, [0, 1]), (143, [2, 3]), (43, [4])]\nStep 3: [(121, [0, 1]), (112, [2, 3]), (23, [4])]\nStep 4: [(90, [0]), (66, [1]), (57, [2])]\n>>>\n\nIn each step, the lifters are assigned to lift the boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while ensuring all constraints are met."
