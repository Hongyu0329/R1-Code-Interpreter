    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step using the available lifters optimally. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by attempting to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are the most challenging to lift and may require multiple lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters**: For each box, check if a single lifter can lift it. If not, combine lifters to lift the box. Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy to find the optimal solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [41, 69, 80, 19, 54, 85, 64, 35]\nlifters = [45, 45, 62, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Check if a single lifter can lift the box\n    for i, capacity in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if capacity >= box_weight:\n            return [i]\n    \n    # Check combinations of lifters\n    for r in range(2, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(available_lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    \n    return None\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes in steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifters[:]\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n            if lifter_indices is not None:\n                step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                boxes.remove(box)\n                for index in lifter_indices:\n                    available_lifters[index] = 0  # Mark lifter as used in this step\n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 4:\n            break\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\nsteps\nassistant > The boxes can be lifted in the following steps:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(85, [0, 1]), (80, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(69, [3]), (64, [0, 1]), (54, [2])]\nStep 3: [(41, [0]), (35, [1]), (19, [2])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution lifts all the boxes in 3 steps, which is within the 4-step limit.
