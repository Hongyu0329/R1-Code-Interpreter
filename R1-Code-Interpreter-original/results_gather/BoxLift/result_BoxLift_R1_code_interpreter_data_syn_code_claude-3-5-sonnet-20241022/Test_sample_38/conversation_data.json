    "Let me solve this optimization problem step by step.\n\n1. First, let's analyze the problem:\n- We have 20 boxes and 7 lifters\n- We need to complete in â‰¤ 7 steps\n- Some boxes require multiple lifters\n- We need to optimize for minimum steps\n\n2.

    "I see that the code execution provided an even better solution than my previous analysis! Let's verify this solution:\n\n1. Step count: 6 steps (better than the previous 7 steps)\n2. All boxes are accounted for:\n   - Heavy boxes (300+): 397, 356, 328, 315, 292\n   - Medium boxes (200-299): 254, 240, 236, 231, 223, 216, 203, 200\n   - Light boxes (<200): 178, 175, 155, 142, 131, 80, 44\n\n3. Each step respects:\n   - Lifter capacity limits\n   - One box per lifter\n   - One use per lifter per step\n   - Combined lifting when needed\n\nThis is indeed a valid and more efficient solution, so let's use this as our final answer:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(397, [0, 1, 5]), (356, [3, 4, 6]), (44, [2])]\nStep 2: [(328, [0, 1, 3]), (315, [5, 6]), (142, [2, 4])]\nStep 3: [(292, [0, 5]), (254, [1, 6]), (240, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 4: [(236, [0, 1]), (231, [3, 5]), (223, [4, 6])]\nStep 5: [(216, [0, 1]), (203, [2, 5]), (200, [3, 6]), (80, [4])]\nStep 6: [(178, [0, 1]), (175, [2, 5]), (155, [6]), (131, [3, 4])]>>>"
