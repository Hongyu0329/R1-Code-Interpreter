    "Let me solve this optimization problem step by step.\n\n1. First, let's analyze the problem:\n- We have 20 boxes and 7 lifters\n- We need to complete in ≤ 7 steps\n- Some boxes require multiple lifters\n- We need to optimize for minimum steps\n\n2.

Each step only uses each lifter once\n2. Combined lifting is used for heavy boxes\n3. Solution is completed within 7 steps\n4. All boxes are assigned\n5.

    "I see the actual output from the code execution. Let me verify this solution:\n\n1. Checking each step:\n   - Step 1: 397 (lifters 0,2,3 = 447 capacity) & 392 (lifters 1,4,5,6 = 441 capacity) ✓\n   - Step 2: 385 (lifters 0,2,3 = 447 capacity) & 371 (lifters 4,5,6 = 371 capacity) ✓\n   - Step 3: 357 (lifters 0,1,3 = 368 capacity) & 343 (lifters 2,4,5 = 367 capacity) & 147 (lifter 6 = 153 capacity) ✓\n   - Step 4: 303 (lifters 2,3 = 347 capacity) & 291 (lifters 0,1,6 = 323 capacity) & 190 (lifters 4,5 = 218 capacity) ✓\n   - Step 5: 277 (lifters 0,3 = 298 capacity) & 241 (lifters 2,4 = 267 capacity) & 231 (lifters 5,6 = 253 capacity) ✓\n   - Step 6: Multiple lighter boxes assigned individually ✓\n   - Step 7: Final light box ✓\n\n2. Verification:\n   - All 20 boxes are lifted\n   - No lifter is used more than once per step\n   - All weight combinations are valid\n   - Solution completed in 7 steps\n   - Each box is lifted by appropriate lifter combinations\n\nThis is actually a better solution than my previous answer because it:\n1. Uses more efficient lifter combinations\n2. Better distributes the work across steps\n3. Groups heavier boxes in earlier steps\n4. Handles lighter boxes efficiently in later steps\n\nLet me provide the verified solution:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(397, [0, 2, 3]), (392, [1, 4, 5, 6])]\nStep 2: [(385, [0, 2, 3]), (371, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 3: [(357, [0, 1, 3]), (343, [2, 4, 5]), (147, [6])]\nStep 4: [(303, [2, 3]), (291, [0, 1, 6]), (190, [4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(277, [0, 3]), (241, [2, 4]), (231, [5, 6])]\nStep 6: [(173, [3]), (138, [2]), (123, [6]), (107, [4]), (97, [0]), (77, [5])]\nStep 7: [(72, [0])]>>>"
