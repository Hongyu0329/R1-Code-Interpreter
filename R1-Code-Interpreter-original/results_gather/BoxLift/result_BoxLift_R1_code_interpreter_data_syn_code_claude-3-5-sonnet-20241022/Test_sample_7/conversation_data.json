    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the problem:\n   - We have 16 boxes and 6 lifters\n   - The heaviest box is 299 and the strongest lifter can lift 160\n   - We'll need to combine lifters for heavy boxes\n   - We need to optimize for minimum steps (≤ 5)\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using a greedy approach with some optimization:\n   - Sort boxes from heaviest to lightest\n   - For each box, try to find the best combination of available lifters\n   - Maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step\n\nHere's the code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef can_lift(lifters, weight):\n    return sum(lifters) >= weight\n\ndef find_lifters_for_weight(available_lifters, weight, lifter_indices):\n    # Try combinations of lifters from smallest to largest groups\n    for i in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(range(len(available_lifters)), i):\n            lifter_weights = [available_lifters[j] for j in combo]\n            if can_lift(lifter_weights, weight):\n                return [lifter_indices[j] for j in combo]\n    return None\n\ndef solve_box_lifting():\n    boxes = [202, 297, 200, 241, 156, 177, 70, 78, 133, 176, 75, 70, 167, 240, 299, 91]\n    lifter_capacities = [56, 160, 118, 138, 160, 150]\n    \n    # Sort boxes from heaviest to lightest\n    boxes = sorted(boxes, reverse=True)\n    steps = []\n    \n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifter_capacities.copy()\n        lifter_indices = list(range(len(lifter_capacities)))\n        \n        # Try to assign as many boxes as possible in this step\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(boxes):\n            box = boxes[i]\n            lifters = find_lifters_for_weight(available_lifters, box, lifter_indices)\n            \n            if lifters:\n                # Remove used lifters\n                for lifter_idx in lifters:\n                    idx = lifter_indices.index(lifter_idx)\n                    available_lifters.pop(idx)\n                    lifter_indices.pop(idx)\n                \n                step.append((box, lifters))\n                boxes.pop(i)\n            else:\n                i += 1\n                \n        if step:\n            steps.append(step)\n            \n    # Format output\n    result = \"\"\n    for i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):\n        result += f\"Step {i}: {step}\\n\"\n    \n    print(result.strip())\n\nsolve_box_lifting()\n```\n\nLet me analyze the output and verify it meets all requirements:\n1.
