    "Let me solve this optimization problem step by step.\n\n1. First, let's analyze the problem:\n   - We have 24 boxes and 7 lifters\n   - Some boxes are too heavy for single lifters\n   - We need to minimize steps while keeping it â‰¤ 8\n   - We need to efficiently combine lifters for heavy boxes\n\n2. Let's write a program to solve this using a greedy approach with some optimization:\n   - Sort boxes in descending order (heaviest first)\n   - For each box, try to find optimal lifter combinations\n   - Keep track of used lifters in each step\n   - Try to maximize parallel lifting in each step\n\nHere's the code to solve this:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_lifter_combinations(box_weight, lifters, used_lifters):\n    available_lifters = [i for i in range(len(lifters)) if i not in used_lifters]\n    \n    # Try combinations of different sizes\n    for size in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in itertools.combinations(available_lifters, size):\n            if sum(lifters[i] for i in combo) >= box_weight:\n                return list(combo)\n    return None\n\ndef solve_box_lifting():\n    boxes = [256, 53, 286, 205, 261, 209, 242, 143, 354, 55, 72, 161, 268, 305, 43, 246, 146, 331, 84, 128, 88, 358, 71, 93]\n    lifters = [189, 58, 58, 79, 123, 192, 116]\n    \n    # Sort boxes in descending order\n    boxes = sorted(enumerate(boxes), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    remaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n    steps = []\n    \n    while remaining_boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = set()\n        \n        # Try to assign as many boxes as possible in current step\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(remaining_boxes):\n            box_idx, box_weight = remaining_boxes[i]\n            lifter_combo = find_lifter_combinations(box_weight, lifters, used_lifters)\n            \n            if lifter_combo:\n                step.append((box_weight, lifter_combo))\n                used_lifters.update(lifter_combo)\n                remaining_boxes.pop(i)\n            else:\n                i += 1\n                \n        if step:\n            steps.append(step)\n        \n        if len(steps) > 8:\n            return \"No solution found within 8 steps\"\n    \n    # Format the output\n    result = \"\"\n    for i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):\n        result += f\"Step {i}: {step}\\n\"\n    \n    return result.strip()\n\nprint(solve_box_lifting())\n```\n\nLet me analyze the output and verify it meets all requirements:\n1.
