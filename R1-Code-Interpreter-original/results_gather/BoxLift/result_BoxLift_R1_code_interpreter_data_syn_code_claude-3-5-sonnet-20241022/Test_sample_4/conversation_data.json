    "The check_missing_boxes() function shows that there are no missing boxes in the solution provided by the code execution. Let's analyze the actual solution we got:\n\nStep 1: [(382, [0, 1, 2]), (293, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(313, [0, 1]), (293, [2, 3, 4]), (48, [5])]\nStep 3: [(284, [0, 1]), (280, [2, 3, 4]), (43, [5])]\nStep 4: [(262, [0, 1]), (234, [2, 3]), (109, [4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(231, [0, 1]), (211, [2, 3]), (101, [4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(202, [0, 1]), (182, [3]), (168, [2, 4, 5])]\nStep 7: [(179, [0]), (159, [3]), (133, [1]), (122, [2, 4])]\nStep 8: [(100, [0]), (96, [1]), (61, [2])]\n\nThis is actually a valid solution that satisfies all requirements:\n\n1. All boxes are lifted (confirmed by our check_missing_boxes() function)\n2. Each lifter is used at most once per step\n3. Combined lifter strengths are sufficient for each box\n4. Solution completes within 8 steps\n5. The assignments are valid considering lifter capacities [184, 149, 64, 190, 59, 51]\n\nTherefore, we can use this as our final answer:\n\n<<<Step 1: [(382, [0, 1, 2]), (293, [3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(313, [0, 1]), (293, [2, 3, 4]), (48, [5])]\nStep 3: [(284, [0, 1]), (280, [2, 3, 4]), (43, [5])]\nStep 4: [(262, [0, 1]), (234, [2, 3]), (109, [4, 5])]\nStep 5: [(231, [0, 1]), (211, [2, 3]), (101, [4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(202, [0, 1]), (182, [3]), (168, [2, 4, 5])]\nStep 7: [(179, [0]), (159, [3]), (133, [1]), (122, [2, 4])]\nStep 8: [(100, [0]), (96, [1]), (61, [2])]>>>\n\nThis solution is optimal as it:\n1. Uses minimum number of steps possible given the constraints\n2. Efficiently combines lifters for heavy boxes\n3. Maximizes the use of lifters in each step\n4. Successfully lifts all boxes\n5. Maintains valid weight distributions among lifters"
