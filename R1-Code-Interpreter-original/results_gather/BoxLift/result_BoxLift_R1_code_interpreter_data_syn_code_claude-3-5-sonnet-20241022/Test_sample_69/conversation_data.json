    "Let me solve this optimization problem step by step.\n\n1. First, let's analyze the problem:\n   - We have 24 boxes and 7 lifters\n   - The heaviest box is 393 units, and the strongest lifter can lift 198 units\n   - We'll need multiple lifters to work together for heavy boxes\n   - We need to minimize the number of steps while using â‰¤ 9 steps\n\n2.

    "I see the code execution output is different from my previous answer. Let me verify this solution:\n\n1. Let's check if this solution is valid:\n   - Each step follows the rules (no lifter used more than once per step)\n   - The combined capacity of lifters in each group is sufficient for the box weight\n   - All boxes are accounted for\n\n2. Let's count the boxes:\n   Original boxes (24): [151, 393, 143, 179, 88, 173, 344, 212, 308, 258, 113, 261, 371, 335, 236, 258, 124, 262, 108, 209, 232, 128, 266, 232]\n\nBoxes in solution:\n- Step 1: 393, 371\n- Step 2: 344, 335\n- Step 3: 308, 266, 179\n- Step 4: 262, 261, 212\n- Step 5: 258, 258, 209\n- Step 6: 236, 232, 173\n- Step 7: 232, 151, 143, 113\n- Step 8: 128, 124, 108, 88\n\nTotal boxes lifted: 24 (matches the original count)\n\n3. The solution:\n- Uses 8 steps (within the 9-step limit)\n- Properly combines lifters for heavy boxes\n- Efficiently uses available lifters in each step\n- All boxes are lifted\n\nTherefore, this is a valid and efficient solution.
