    "Let me solve this optimization problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the problem:\n   - We have 20 boxes and 6 lifters\n   - The lifters' combined capacity is 683 (sum of all lifters)\n   - Some boxes are too heavy for single lifters\n   - We need to optimize for minimum steps (≤ 13)\n\n2) Let's write a Python program to solve this using a greedy approach with some optimization:\n   - Sort boxes in descending order\n   - For each step, try to:\n     a) Assign heaviest boxes first\n     b) Use minimum required lifters for each box\n     c) Maximize the number of boxes lifted per step\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef can_lift(lifters, weight):\n    # Try all possible combinations of lifters to find if they can lift the weight\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in itertools.combinations(range(len(lifters)), r):\n            if sum(lifters[i] for i in combo) >= weight:\n                return list(combo)\n    return None\n\ndef solve_box_lifting():\n    boxes = [254, 205, 272, 360, 320, 328, 267, 223, 337, 238, 134, 235, 388, 160, 244, 378, 349, 262, 104, 396]\n    lifters = [132, 86, 81, 199, 93, 92]\n    \n    # Sort boxes in descending order\n    boxes = sorted([(w, i) for i, w in enumerate(boxes)], reverse=True)\n    remaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n    steps = []\n    \n    while remaining_boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = set(range(len(lifters)))\n        \n        # Try to assign as many boxes as possible in current step\n        for box_weight, box_idx in remaining_boxes[:]:\n            if not available_lifters:\n                break\n                \n            # Find minimum combination of available lifters that can lift this box\n            possible_lifters = [i for i in available_lifters]\n            lifter_combo = can_lift([lifters[i] for i in possible_lifters], box_weight)\n            \n            if lifter_combo:\n                # Convert local lifter indices to global indices\n                global_lifter_combo = [possible_lifters[i] for i in lifter_combo]\n                step.append((box_weight, global_lifter_combo))\n                remaining_boxes.remove((box_weight, box_idx))\n                available_lifters -= set(global_lifter_combo)\n        \n        if step:\n            steps.append(step)\n    \n    # Format and print the solution\n    result = \"\"\n    for i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):\n        result += f\"Step {i}: {step}\\n\"\n    print(result.strip())\n\nsolve_box_lifting()\n```\n\nLet me analyze the output and verify if it meets all requirements:\n1. Each step assigns boxes to lifters without exceeding their capacities\n2. No lifter is used more than once per step\n3. Multiple lifters can combine to lift heavy boxes\n4.
