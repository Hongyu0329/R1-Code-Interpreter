    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the problem:\n   - We have 16 boxes and 6 lifters\n   - Many boxes are too heavy for single lifters\n   - We need to optimize for minimum steps\n   - We need to consider combinations of lifters for heavy boxes\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using a heuristic approach:\n   - Sort boxes by weight (descending)\n   - For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible\n   - For heavy boxes, combine lifters optimally\n   - Keep track of used lifters in each step\n\nHere's the code to solve this:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef can_lift(box_weight, lifters_combination, lifter_capacities):\n    return sum(lifter_capacities[i] for i in lifters_combination) >= box_weight\n\ndef find_solution():\n    boxes = [169, 198, 165, 154, 71, 159, 55, 205, 299, 170, 122, 160, 43, 259, 246, 172]\n    lifter_capacities = [80, 51, 45, 141, 83, 152]\n    \n    # Sort boxes in descending order\n    boxes_with_index = list(enumerate(boxes))\n    boxes_with_index.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    solution = []\n    remaining_boxes = boxes_with_index.copy()\n    \n    while remaining_boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = set(range(len(lifter_capacities)))\n        \n        # Try to assign boxes in current step\n        for box_idx, box_weight in remaining_boxes[:]:\n            if not available_lifters:\n                break\n                \n            # Try different combinations of available lifters\n            assigned = False\n            for size in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n                if assigned:\n                    break\n                for lifters in itertools.combinations(available_lifters, size):\n                    if can_lift(box_weight, lifters, lifter_capacities):\n                        step.append((box_weight, list(lifters)))\n                        available_lifters -= set(lifters)\n                        remaining_boxes.remove((box_idx, box_weight))\n                        assigned = True\n                        break\n        \n        if step:\n            solution.append(step)\n        \n        if len(solution) > 7:\n            return None\n    \n    return solution\n\n# Find and format solution\nsolution = find_solution()\nif solution:\n    formatted_solution = []\n    for i, step in enumerate(solution, 1):\n        formatted_solution.append(f\"Step {i}: {step}\")\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(formatted_solution) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"<<<No solution found within 7 steps>>>\")\n```\n\nThe code uses a greedy approach with the following strategy:\n1.
