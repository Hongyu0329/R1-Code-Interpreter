Successfully lifts all boxes within 6 steps\n2. Efficiently combines lifters for heavy boxes\n3. Maximizes the use of available lifters in each step\n4. Prioritizes heavier boxes first\n5. Ensures no lifter is used more than once per step\n6. All boxes are properly assigned and lifted",
    "Great! The code executed successfully and found a valid solution in 5 steps, which is even better than our previous attempts.

It completes all lifting in just 5 steps (better than the required 6 steps)\n2. All 20 boxes are lifted\n3. Heavy boxes are efficiently handled by combining lifters\n4. Each lifter is used at most once per step\n5. The solution maximizes the number of boxes lifted in later steps when boxes are lighter\n6. All lifting capacity constraints are respected"
