    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [49, 239, 263, 284, 45, 159, 306, 398, 279, 137, 218, 387, 161, 287, 171, 345, 373, 271, 60, 396]\nlifters = [151, 91, 70, 108, 182, 200]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n            if lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            # Box can be lifted, add to step\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Remove used lifters\n            for i in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                del remaining_lifters[i]\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find the optimal way to lift all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, considering the constraints provided. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The timeout error suggests that the code is taking too long to execute, likely due to inefficient handling of the problem constraints. Let's optimize the approach to ensure it runs within the time limits.\n\nTo improve efficiency, we can:\n1. Use a greedy approach to assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n2. Use a more efficient method to find combinations of lifters that can lift a box.\n\nLet's revise the code to address these points:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [49, 239, 263, 284, 45, 159, 306, 398, 279, 137, 218, 387, 161, 287, 171, 345, 373, 271, 60, 396]\nlifters = [151, 91, 70, 108, 182, 200]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    used_lifters_indices = set()\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for r in range(1, len(remaining_lifters) + 1):\n            for combo in combinations(enumerate(remaining_lifters), r):\n                indices, lifter_combo = zip(*combo)\n                if sum(lifter_combo) >= box and not used_lifters_indices.intersection(indices):\n                    step.append((box, list(indices)))\n                    used_lifters_indices.update(indices)\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                continue\n            break\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code uses combinations to find the right set of lifters for each box, ensuring that we don't reuse lifters within the same step. Let's execute this revised code.",
