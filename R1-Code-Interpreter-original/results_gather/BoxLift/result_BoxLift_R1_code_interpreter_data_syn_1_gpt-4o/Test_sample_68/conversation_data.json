Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step.\n2. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n3. Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step.\n4. Multiple lifters can combine together to lift one box if the box is too heavy for a single lifter.\n5. Try to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible.\n6.

    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [190, 107, 357, 385, 343, 392, 97, 277, 231, 77, 147, 138, 371, 303, 173, 397, 123, 72, 241, 291]\nlifters = [100, 70, 149, 198, 118, 100, 153]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box, _ in step if box not in [b for b, _ in step]]\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, using the minimum number of steps.

Let's refine the approach to ensure that boxes are correctly lifted and removed from the list after each step.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n1.
