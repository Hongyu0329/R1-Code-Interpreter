    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 11.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [215, 113, 62, 255, 246, 148, 283, 149, 295, 250, 114, 48, 245, 145, 153, 50]\nlifters = [82, 55, 159, 56, 88]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if total_capacity < box:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                total_capacity += lifter\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Remove used lifters\n            for i in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                del remaining_lifters[i]\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code output shows the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters. However, there seems to be an issue with the solution as it does not efficiently utilize the lifters, and the number of steps exceeds the maximum allowed (11 steps). Additionally, the output indicates that some lifters are being used multiple times in a single step, which violates the constraint that each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n\nLet's refine the approach to ensure that we efficiently use the lifters and adhere to all constraints:\n\n1. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by using the available lifters.\n2. Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n3. Combine lifters to lift heavier boxes only when necessary.\n4. Keep track of the lifters used in each step to avoid reusing them.\n\nLet's implement this refined approach in Python.\n\n```python\nboxes = [215, 113, 62, 255, 246, 148, 283, 149, 295, 250, 114, 48, 245, 145, 153, 50]\nlifters = [82, 55, 159, 56, 88]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and total_capacity < box:\n                lifter_indices.append(i)\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code to see if it provides a more efficient solution.",
