    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 5 steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of the boxes lifted in each step and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 5 steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [128, 144, 42, 49, 132, 118, 32, 48, 21, 94, 85, 51]\nlifters = [85, 90, 40, 102]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes.copy()\n\nfor step in range(5):\n    step_lift = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        # Try to lift the box with available lifters\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and remaining_weight > 0:\n                if capacity >= remaining_weight:\n                    lifter_indices.append(i)\n                    used_lifters[i] = True\n                    remaining_weight = 0\n                    break\n                else:\n                    lifter_indices.append(i)\n                    used_lifters[i] = True\n                    remaining_weight -= capacity\n        \n        if remaining_weight == 0:\n            step_lift.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step_lift)\n    \n    if not remaining_boxes:\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, adhering to the constraints and minimizing the number of steps. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
