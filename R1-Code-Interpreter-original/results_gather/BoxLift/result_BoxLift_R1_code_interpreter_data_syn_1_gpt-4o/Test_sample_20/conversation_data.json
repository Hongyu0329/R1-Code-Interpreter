    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 4 steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [18, 27, 65, 31, 60, 73, 30, 67]\nlifters = [66, 72, 43]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(4):\n    step_lifting = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step_lifting.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters to lift the box\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        step_lifting.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the optimal steps for lifting all the boxes.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps.
