    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift a single box if necessary. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight, as heavier boxes are more challenging to lift and may require more lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity, as stronger lifters can handle heavier boxes more efficiently.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [88, 313, 344, 387, 392, 370, 99, 389, 340, 391, 131, 147, 334, 251, 157, 144, 290, 167, 141, 79]\nlifters = [148, 193, 54, 146, 106, 53, 88]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if not boxes:\n            break\n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if used_lifters[j]:\n                continue\n            if lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                boxes[i] = None\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters\n            total_capacity = 0\n            lifter_indices = []\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                if total_capacity + lifter >= box:\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                    for idx in lifter_indices:\n                        used_lifters[idx] = True\n                    boxes[i] = None\n                    break\n                else:\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n    \n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box in boxes if box is not None]\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 7. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the solution requires 8 steps, which exceeds the maximum allowed 7 steps. We need to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes to fit within the 7-step constraint.\n\nTo achieve this, we can try to optimize the combination of lifters more effectively, ensuring that we maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.
