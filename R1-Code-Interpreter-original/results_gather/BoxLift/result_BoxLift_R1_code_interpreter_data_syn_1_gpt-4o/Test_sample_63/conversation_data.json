    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes, and each lifter can only lift one box per step. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight, as heavier boxes are more challenging to lift and may require more lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity, as stronger lifters can handle heavier boxes or contribute more to lifting a heavy box.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible, starting with the heaviest box that can be lifted by the available lifters.\n4. Use a greedy approach to assign lifters to boxes, ensuring that the sum of the lifters' capacities meets or exceeds the box's weight.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, keeping track of the steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [49, 186, 267, 243, 352, 74, 160, 115, 138, 301, 250, 145, 294, 232, 144, 293, 287, 358, 267, 266]\nlifters = [60, 92, 94, 68, 72, 79]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        remaining_capacity = box\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n            if remaining_capacity <= 0:\n                break\n            if lifter <= remaining_capacity:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                remaining_capacity -= lifter\n        if remaining_capacity <= 0:\n            # Box can be lifted\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n            for index in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                del available_lifters[index]\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the available lifters.

    "The timeout error suggests that the code took too long to execute, likely due to inefficient handling of the problem constraints. Let's optimize the approach to ensure it runs within the time limits.\n\nTo improve efficiency, we can:\n1. Use a more efficient method to find combinations of lifters that can lift a box.\n2. Avoid modifying lists while iterating over them, which can be computationally expensive.\n\nLet's revise the code to address these issues:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [49, 186, 267, 243, 352, 74, 160, 115, 138, 301, 250, 145, 294, 232, 144, 293, 287, 358, 267, 266]\nlifters = [60, 92, 94, 68, 72, 79]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = list(enumerate(lifters))\n    remaining_boxes = []\n\n    for box in boxes:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        found = False\n        for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n            for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n                if sum(lifter[1] for lifter in combo) >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [lifter[0] for lifter in combo]))\n                    # Remove used lifters from available lifters\n                    for lifter in combo:\n                        available_lifters.remove(lifter)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            remaining_boxes.append(box)\n\n    boxes = remaining_boxes\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis revised code uses combinations to find suitable lifter groups for each box, which should be more efficient.
