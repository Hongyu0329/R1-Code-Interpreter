    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step using the available lifters optimally. The constraints are that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight, as heavier boxes are more challenging to lift and may require more lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity, as stronger lifters should be used first to maximize efficiency.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [71, 72, 167, 64, 339, 45, 243, 53, 52, 280, 164, 322, 362, 75, 158, 142, 150, 353, 182, 282]\nlifters = [139, 55, 172, 82, 129, 59, 130]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark this box as lifted\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box in boxes if box is not None]\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, given the constraints. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The timeout error suggests that the code took too long to execute, possibly due to an inefficient approach in finding combinations of lifters for each box. Let's optimize the code by using a more efficient method to find combinations of lifters that can lift each box.\n\nWe can use a recursive approach with memoization to find the best combination of lifters for each box. This will help reduce the computation time significantly.\n\nLet's rewrite the code with this optimization:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [71, 72, 167, 64, 339, 45, 243, 53, 52, 280, 164, 322, 362, 75, 158, 142, 150, 353, 182, 282]\nlifters = [139, 55, 172, 82, 129, 59, 130]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n            for combo in combinations(range(len(lifters)), r):\n                if not any(used_lifters[j] for j in combo):\n                    if sum(lifters[j] for j in combo) >= box:\n                        lifter_indices = list(combo)\n                        break\n            if lifter_indices:\n                break\n        if lifter_indices:\n            for j in lifter_indices:\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark this box as lifted\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box in boxes if box is not None]\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code uses combinations to find the best set of lifters for each box, ensuring that the solution is found more efficiently. Let's execute this optimized code.",
