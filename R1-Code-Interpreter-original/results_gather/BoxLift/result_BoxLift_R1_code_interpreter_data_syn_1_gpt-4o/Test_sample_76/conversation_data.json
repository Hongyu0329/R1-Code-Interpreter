    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 6 steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of the boxes lifted in each step and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 6 steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [94, 177, 88, 131, 87, 113, 148, 86, 141, 83, 86, 73]\nlifters = [55, 92, 35, 48, 96]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n\nfor step in range(6):\n    step_lift = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        \n        for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and total_capacity < box:\n                lifter_indices.append(i)\n                total_capacity += capacity\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n            \n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        \n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step_lift.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step_lift)\n    \n    if not remaining_boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, adhering to the constraints and aiming to complete the task in 6 steps or fewer. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution that lifts all the boxes in 6 steps, adhering to the constraints. Each step lists the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used. Here's the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(177, [0, 1])]\nStep 2: [(148, [0, 1])]\nStep 3: [(141, [0, 1]), (131, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 4: [(113, [0, 1]), (94, [2, 3])]\nStep 5: [(88, [0]), (87, [1]), (86, [2, 3])]\nStep 6: [(86, [0]), (83, [1]), (73, [2, 3])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution efficiently uses the lifters to lift all the boxes within the allowed 6 steps."
