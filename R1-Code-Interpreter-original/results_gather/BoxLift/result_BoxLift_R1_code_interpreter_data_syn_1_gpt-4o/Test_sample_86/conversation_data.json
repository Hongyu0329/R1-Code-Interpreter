    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 4 steps.\n\n### Reasoning and Approach:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try and match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Greedy Assignment**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by:\n   - Assigning the heaviest available box to the strongest available lifter or combination of lifters.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to meet or exceed the box's weight.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Steps**: Repeat the process for each step until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\n4. **Optimization**: Aim to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nboxes = [57, 112, 121, 49, 166, 143, 169, 43, 90, 66, 23, 143]\nlifters = [103, 49, 95, 97, 98]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    from itertools import combinations\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return list(combo)\n    return []\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in 4 steps\nfor step in range(4):\n    step_lifting = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    \n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        available_lifters = [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        \n        if lifter_combo:\n            step_lifting.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in lifter_combo:\n                used_lifters.add(lifters.index(l))\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n    \n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift all boxes in the minimum number of steps, ensuring that the constraints are met. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution that lifts all the boxes in 4 steps, adhering to the constraints. Here's the breakdown of the solution:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Box weighing 169 is lifted by lifters with indices [0, 1].\n  - Box weighing 166 is lifted by lifters with indices [2, 3].\n  - Box weighing 49 is lifted by lifter with index [4].\n\n- **Step 2**: \n  - Box weighing 143 is lifted by lifters with indices [0, 1].\n  - Another box weighing 143 is lifted by lifters with indices [2, 3].\n  - Box weighing 43 is lifted by lifter with index [4].\n\n- **Step 3**: \n  - Box weighing 121 is lifted by lifters with indices [0, 1].\n  - Box weighing 112 is lifted by lifters with indices [2, 3].\n  - Box weighing 23 is lifted by lifter with index [4].\n\n- **Step 4**: \n  - Box weighing 90 is lifted by lifter with index [0].\n  - Box weighing 66 is lifted by lifter with index [1].\n  - Box weighing 57 is lifted by lifter with index [2].\n\nThis solution efficiently uses the available lifters to lift all boxes in the minimum number of steps, which is 4, as required.\n\n<<<Step 1: [(169, [0, 1]), (166, [2, 3]), (49, [4])]\nStep 2: [(143, [0, 1]), (143, [2, 3]), (43, [4])]\nStep 3: [(121, [0, 1]), (112, [2, 3]), (23, [4])]\nStep 4: [(90, [0]), (66, [1]), (57, [2])]>>>"
