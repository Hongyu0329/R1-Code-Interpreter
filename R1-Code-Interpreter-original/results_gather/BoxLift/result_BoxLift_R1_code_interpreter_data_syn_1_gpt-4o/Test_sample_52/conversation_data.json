    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 7 steps.\n\n### Reasoning and Approach:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to tackle the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Greedy Assignment**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available box to the strongest available lifter or combination of lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\n5. **Optimization**: Aim to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step by efficiently using the available lifters.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [75, 298, 70, 200, 278, 35, 278, 56, 270, 212, 161, 98, 244, 292, 177, 145]\nlifters = [105, 102, 125, 93, 123]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters for a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    from itertools import combinations\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return list(combo)\n    return []\n\n# Assign boxes to lifters in steps\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_combo = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            step.append((box, [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for l in lifter_combo:\n                available_lifters.remove(l)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the solution is as efficient as possible.
