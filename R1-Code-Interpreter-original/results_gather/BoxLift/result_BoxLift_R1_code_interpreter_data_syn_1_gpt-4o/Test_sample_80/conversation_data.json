    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within the maximum allowed steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of the boxes lifted in each step and ensure all boxes are lifted within 4 steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [14, 13, 59, 47, 73, 64, 58, 75]\nlifters = [74, 57, 51]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor _ in range(4):  # Maximum 4 steps\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters to lift the box\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the optimal steps for lifting all the boxes.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps. Let's format the output according to the required format:\n\n- Step 1: Lift the heaviest boxes first, using combinations of lifters if necessary.\n- Step 2: Continue lifting the remaining boxes, again using combinations if needed.\n- Step 3: Proceed with the next set of boxes.\n- Step 4: Lift the lightest boxes last.\n\nHere's the formatted solution:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(75, [0, 1]), (47, [2])]\nStep 2: [(73, [0]), (64, [1, 2])]\nStep 3: [(59, [0]), (58, [1, 2])]\nStep 4: [(14, [0]), (13, [1])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in 4 steps, adhering to the rules provided."
