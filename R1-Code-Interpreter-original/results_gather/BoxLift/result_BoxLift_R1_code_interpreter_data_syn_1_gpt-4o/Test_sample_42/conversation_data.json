    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes while ensuring that all boxes are lifted within the maximum allowed steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [86, 183, 78, 85, 112, 170, 130, 121, 208, 226, 39, 176, 68, 256, 56, 34]\nlifters = [116, 81, 149, 77, 138]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 6:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [i]))\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n                remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            for i in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[i]:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(i + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[i] + lifters[j] >= box:\n                        step.append((box, [i, j]))\n                        used_lifters[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n                if box not in remaining_boxes:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, adhering to the constraints and minimizing the number of steps. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps. Let's format the output according to the required format:\n\n1. The solution consists of 5 steps, which is within the allowed maximum of 6 steps.\n2.
