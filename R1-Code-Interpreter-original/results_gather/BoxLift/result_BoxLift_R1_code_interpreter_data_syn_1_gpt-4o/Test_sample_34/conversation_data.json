    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes, and we need to ensure that all boxes are lifted in 19 steps or fewer.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of the boxes lifted in each step and ensure that all boxes are lifted within the allowed number of steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [399, 277, 278, 282, 209, 309, 281, 53, 325, 239, 363, 363, 308, 244, 392, 323, 255, 79, 280, 336, 395, 318, 203, 364]\nlifters = [125, 145, 57, 73, 81, 70]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if total_capacity < box:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                total_capacity += lifter\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            # Assign this box to the current step\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Remove used lifters\n            for i in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                del remaining_lifters[i]\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters.

Let's adjust the strategy to better utilize the lifters' capacities and reduce the number of steps.\n\n```python\nboxes = [399, 277, 278, 282, 209, 309, 281, 53, 325, 239, 363, 363, 308, 244, 392, 323, 255, 79, 280, 336, 395, 318, 203, 364]\nlifters = [125, 145, 57, 73, 81, 70]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    used_indices = set()\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if total_capacity < box and i not in used_indices:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                total_capacity += lifter\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            # Assign this box to the current step\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Mark used lifters\n            used_indices.update(used_lifters)\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this revised code to see if it fits within the 19-step constraint.",
