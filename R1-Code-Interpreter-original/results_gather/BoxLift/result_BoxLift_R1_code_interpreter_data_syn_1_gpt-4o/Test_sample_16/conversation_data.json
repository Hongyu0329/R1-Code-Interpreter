    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 5 steps.\n\n### Reasoning and Approach:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Greedy Assignment**: In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by:\n   - Assigning the heaviest available box to the strongest available lifter or combination of lifters.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 5.\n\n5. **Optimization**: Aim to minimize the number of steps by efficiently utilizing the lifters' capacities.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [166, 194, 27, 144, 198, 172, 81, 117, 154, 183, 27, 184]\nlifters = [97, 90, 80, 111, 76]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n            # Try to find a single lifter or combination of lifters to lift the box\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [j]))\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try combinations of lifters\n                for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        continue\n                    for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                        if used_lifters[k]:\n                            continue\n                        if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                            step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                            used_lifters[j] = True\n                            used_lifters[k] = True\n                            boxes.remove(box)\n                            break\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        break\n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 5:\n            return \"Not possible to lift all boxes in 5 steps\"\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the steps\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to assign lifters to boxes in the most efficient way possible, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 5 or fewer steps. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
