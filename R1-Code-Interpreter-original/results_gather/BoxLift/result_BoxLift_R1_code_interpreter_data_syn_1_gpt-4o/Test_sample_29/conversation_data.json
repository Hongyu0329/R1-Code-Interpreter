    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the rules provided. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes while ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 9 or fewer steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of the boxes lifted in each step and ensure that all boxes are lifted within the allowed number of steps.\n\nLet's implement this plan using Python code to determine the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\n```python\nboxes = [100, 225, 68, 49, 127, 244, 299, 344, 330, 310, 299, 189, 124, 216, 350, 367, 85, 231, 165, 144, 323, 342, 368, 179]\nlifters = [64, 93, 158, 137, 107, 95, 173]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                    break\n        \n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n    \n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    for box, _ in step:\n        boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, adhering to the rules provided.
