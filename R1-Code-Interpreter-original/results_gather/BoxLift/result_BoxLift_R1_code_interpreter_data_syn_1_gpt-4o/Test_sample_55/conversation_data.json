    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps allowed. We need to consider the constraints of lifter capacities and the ability to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the heaviest boxes**: These will likely require multiple lifters to lift.\n2. **Match lifters to boxes**: Start with the heaviest boxes and assign lifters, combining their capacities if necessary.\n3. **Repeat the process**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that each step uses the lifters efficiently.\n\nWe'll use a greedy approach to assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest boxes and using the strongest available lifters. Let's implement this in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [24, 78, 95, 23, 57, 36, 40, 26]\nlifters = [56, 51, 66, 65]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of steps to lift all boxes\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n            for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n                if lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [i]))\n                    remaining_lifters.pop(i)\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try to combine lifters to lift the box\n                for i in range(len(remaining_lifters)):\n                    for j in range(i + 1, len(remaining_lifters)):\n                        if remaining_lifters[i] + remaining_lifters[j] >= box:\n                            step.append((box, [i, j]))\n                            remaining_lifters.pop(j)\n                            remaining_lifters.pop(i)\n                            boxes.remove(box)\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        continue\n                    break\n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 3:\n            return \"Not possible to lift all boxes in 3 steps\"\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the steps\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the steps required to lift all the boxes.",
    "The code output indicates that the boxes can be lifted in three steps, but there is an issue with the assignment of lifters. The same lifter is being used multiple times in a single step, which violates the rule that each lifter can only be used once per step. Let's correct this by ensuring that each lifter is only used once per step.\n\nWe'll adjust the logic to ensure that lifters are not reused within the same step. Let's refine the code to address this issue.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [24, 78, 95, 23, 57, 36, 40, 26]\nlifters = [56, 51, 66, 65]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of steps to lift all boxes\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n            for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[i] and lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [i]))\n                    used_lifters[i] = True\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try to combine lifters to lift the box\n                for i in range(len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[i]:\n                        continue\n                    for j in range(i + 1, len(lifters)):\n                        if used_lifters[j]:\n                            continue\n                        if lifters[i] + lifters[j] >= box:\n                            step.append((box, [i, j]))\n                            used_lifters[i] = True\n                            used_lifters[j] = True\n                            boxes.remove(box)\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        continue\n                    break\n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 3:\n            return \"Not possible to lift all boxes in 3 steps\"\n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the steps\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code to ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.",
