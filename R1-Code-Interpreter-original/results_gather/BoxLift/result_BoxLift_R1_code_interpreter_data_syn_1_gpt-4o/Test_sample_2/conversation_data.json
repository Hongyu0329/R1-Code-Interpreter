    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [66, 299, 90, 133, 52, 245, 57, 62, 71, 217, 117, 193, 204, 84, 224, 51]\nlifters = [123, 155, 65, 92, 92]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                total_capacity = lifters[j]\n                lifter_indices = [j]\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if total_capacity + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        lifter_indices.append(k)\n                        step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        for idx in lifter_indices:\n                            used_lifters[idx] = True\n                        break\n                    total_capacity += lifters[k]\n                    lifter_indices.append(k)\n                if len(step) > len(boxes) - i:\n                    break\n        if len(step) > len(boxes) - i:\n            break\n\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    for lifted_box, _ in step:\n        boxes.remove(lifted_box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 6. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The error occurs because the code attempts to remove a box from the list that has already been removed in a previous iteration. This happens because the same box weight can appear multiple times in the list, and the `remove` method removes the first occurrence of the specified value.
