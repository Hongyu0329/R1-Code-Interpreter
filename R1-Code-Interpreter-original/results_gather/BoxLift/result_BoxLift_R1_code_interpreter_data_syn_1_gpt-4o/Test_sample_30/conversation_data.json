    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 4 steps.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Sorting will help us efficiently match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: Start with the heaviest box and try to assign the strongest available lifter or a combination of lifters that can lift it. Continue this process for all boxes.\n\n3. **Repeat for each step**: After assigning lifters for one step, move to the next step and repeat the process for the remaining boxes.\n\n4. **Ensure all boxes are lifted in 4 steps or less**: If the solution exceeds 4 steps, we need to re-evaluate the assignments to optimize the number of steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nboxes = [14, 51, 14, 69, 77, 20, 52, 96]\nlifters = [69, 66, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters that can lift a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters that can lift the box\n    for i in range(len(available_lifters)):\n        if available_lifters[i] >= box_weight:\n            return [i], available_lifters[i]\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(available_lifters)):\n            if available_lifters[i] + available_lifters[j] >= box_weight:\n                return [i, j], available_lifters[i] + available_lifters[j]\n    return [], 0\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in 4 steps or less\nfor step in range(4):\n    step_assignments = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in boxes:\n        lifter_indices, total_capacity = find_lifters_for_box(box, [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters])\n        if lifter_indices:\n            step_assignments.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n    steps.append(step_assignments)\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box, _ in step_assignments if box not in boxes]\n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps, while adhering to the constraints.

Let's refine the approach to ensure that each lifter is used only once per step and that we distribute the lifting tasks across multiple steps.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. **Track used lifters**: Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n2. **Distribute tasks across steps**: If a box cannot be lifted in the current step due to lifter constraints, defer it to the next step.\n3. **Optimize lifter combinations**: Use combinations of lifters to lift heavier boxes when necessary.\n\nLet's implement this refined approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the weights of the boxes and the capacities of the lifters\nboxes = [14, 51, 14, 69, 77, 20, 52, 96]\nlifters = [69, 66, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize steps\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters that can lift a given box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    # Check single lifters first\n    for i, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if lifter >= box_weight:\n            return [i]\n    # Check combinations of two lifters\n    for i, j in combinations(range(len(available_lifters)), 2):\n        if available_lifters[i] + available_lifters[j] >= box_weight:\n            return [i, j]\n    return []\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in 4 steps or less\nfor step in range(4):\n    step_assignments = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    remaining_boxes = []\n    for box in boxes:\n        available_lifters = [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices:\n            step_assignments.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n        else:\n            remaining_boxes.append(box)\n    steps.append(step_assignments)\n    boxes = remaining_boxes\n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code should correctly distribute the lifting tasks across multiple steps, ensuring that each lifter is used only once per step.
