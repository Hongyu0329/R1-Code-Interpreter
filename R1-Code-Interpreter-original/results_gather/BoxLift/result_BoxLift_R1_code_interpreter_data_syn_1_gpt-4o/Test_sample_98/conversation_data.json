    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given constraints. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n2. Multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n3. We need to minimize the number of steps, ideally not exceeding 6 steps.\n\nThe approach involves:\n- Sorting the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n- Sorting the lifters in descending order to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n- Iteratively assigning lifters to boxes, combining lifters if a single lifter cannot lift a box alone.\n- Keeping track of which lifters are used in each step and ensuring they are not reused within the same step.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [55, 244, 173, 293, 90, 126, 340, 250, 66, 143, 103, 244, 76, 166, 130, 216, 54, 196, 245, 307]\nlifters = [142, 178, 196, 52, 101, 144, 50]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity < box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will execute and provide the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution that lifts all the boxes in 6 steps, adhering to the constraints given. Each step lists the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used to lift each box. The solution ensures that:\n\n1. Each lifter is used only once per step.\n2. Multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n3. The total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(340, [0, 1]), (307, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 2: [(293, [0, 1]), (250, [2, 3])]\nStep 3: [(245, [0, 1]), (244, [2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(244, [0, 1]), (216, [2, 3]), (196, [4, 5, 6])]\nStep 5: [(173, [0]), (166, [1]), (143, [2]), (130, [3]), (126, [4, 5])]\nStep 6: [(103, [0]), (90, [1]), (76, [2]), (66, [3]), (55, [4]), (54, [5, 6])]\n>>>"
