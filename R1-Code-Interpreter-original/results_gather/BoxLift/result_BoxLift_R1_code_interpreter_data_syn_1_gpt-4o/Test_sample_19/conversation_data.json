    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step using the available lifters optimally. The constraints are that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to use the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, either individually or in combination.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [55, 77, 274, 297, 70, 312, 108, 84, 340, 273, 157, 386, 95, 223, 311, 306, 287, 91, 220, 296, 320, 237, 97, 73]\nlifters = [167, 138, 133, 87, 142, 167, 140]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark this box as lifted\n    boxes = [b for b in boxes if b is not None]  # Remove lifted boxes\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, using the minimum number of steps. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The timeout error suggests that the code is taking too long to execute, possibly due to inefficient handling of the problem constraints. Let's refine the approach to ensure it runs efficiently within the time limits.\n\nTo optimize, we can:\n1. Use a greedy approach to assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n2. Ensure that we only attempt feasible combinations of lifters for each box, avoiding unnecessary computations.\n\nLet's rewrite the code with these optimizations:\n\n```python\nboxes = [55, 77, 274, 297, 70, 312, 108, 84, 340, 273, 157, 386, 95, 223, 311, 306, 287, 91, 220, 296, 320, 237, 97, 73]\nlifters = [167, 138, 133, 87, 142, 167, 140]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    remaining_boxes = []\n    \n    for box in boxes:\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        \n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n        else:\n            remaining_boxes.append(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n    boxes = remaining_boxes\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code should be more efficient by reducing unnecessary checks and focusing on feasible lifter combinations. Let's execute this optimized code.",
    "It seems the approach is still not efficient enough to execute within the time constraints. Let's try a different strategy to optimize the solution further. We can use a more structured approach to ensure that we are efficiently combining lifters to lift the heaviest boxes first, while also ensuring that we do not exceed the maximum number of steps.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n1. Use a greedy algorithm to attempt to lift the heaviest boxes first.\n2. For each box, try to find the minimum number of lifters needed to lift it.\n3. If a box cannot be lifted in the current step, move to the next step.\n4. Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [55, 77, 274, 297, 70, 312, 108, 84, 340, 273, 157, 386, 95, 223, 311, 306, 287, 91, 220, 296, 320, 237, 97, 73]\nlifters = [167, 138, 133, 87, 142, 167, 140]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes and len(steps) < 7:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    remaining_boxes = []\n    \n    for box in boxes:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        found = False\n        for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n            for combo in combinations(range(len(lifters)), r):\n                if not any(used_lifters[i] for i in combo):\n                    if sum(lifters[i] for i in combo) >= box:\n                        step.append((box, list(combo)))\n                        for i in combo:\n                            used_lifters[i] = True\n                        found = True\n                        break\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            remaining_boxes.append(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n    boxes = remaining_boxes\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code uses combinations to find the minimum set of lifters needed to lift each box, ensuring that we efficiently use the available lifters. Let's execute this code to see if it resolves the timeout issue.",
