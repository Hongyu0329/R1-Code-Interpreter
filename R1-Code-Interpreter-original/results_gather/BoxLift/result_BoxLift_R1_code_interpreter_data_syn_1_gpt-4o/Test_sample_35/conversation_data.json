    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps allowed. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes and lifters to facilitate the assignment process. We will try to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are more restrictive in terms of lifter combinations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n3. Try to assign the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n4. Repeat the process for the remaining boxes and lifters until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [16, 56, 15, 82, 85, 12, 12, 32]\nlifters = [63, 48, 72, 68]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_assignments = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if used_lifters[j]:\n                continue\n            if lifter >= box:\n                # Single lifter can lift the box\n                step_assignments.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        # Combination of two lifters can lift the box\n                        step_assignments.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step_assignments)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the output and determine the optimal steps for lifting all the boxes.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a solution for lifting all the boxes in the minimum number of steps, adhering to the constraints given. Let's interpret the output:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Box weighing 85 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1.\n  - Box weighing 82 is lifted by lifters 2 and 3.\n\n- **Step 2**: \n  - Box weighing 56 is lifted by lifter 0.\n  - Box weighing 32 is lifted by lifter 1.\n  - Box weighing 16 is lifted by lifter 2.\n  - Box weighing 15 is lifted by lifter 3.\n\n- **Step 3**: \n  - Box weighing 12 is lifted by lifter 0.\n  - Box weighing 12 is lifted by lifter 1.\n\nThis solution uses exactly 3 steps, which is the maximum allowed, and all boxes are lifted according to the rules provided.\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(85, [0, 1]), (82, [2, 3])]\nStep 2: [(56, [0]), (32, [1]), (16, [2]), (15, [3])]\nStep 3: [(12, [0]), (12, [1])]\n>>>"
