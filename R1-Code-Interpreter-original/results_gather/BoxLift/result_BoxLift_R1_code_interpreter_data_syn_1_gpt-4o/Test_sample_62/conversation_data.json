    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [91, 207, 152, 47, 209, 54, 251, 176, 194, 221, 152, 141, 128, 159, 57, 184]\nlifters = [149, 131, 113, 109, 124]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                boxes.remove(box)\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no single lifter can lift the box, try to combine lifters\n            total_capacity = 0\n            lifter_indices = []\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j]:\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n            else:\n                # If we can't lift the box even with all lifters, we need to stop\n                break\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the steps required to lift all the boxes.",
    "The code output indicates that the solution requires 7 steps, which exceeds the maximum allowed 6 steps.
