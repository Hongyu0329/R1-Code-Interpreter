    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step using the available lifters optimally. We have to ensure that the total weight lifted in each step does not exceed the combined capacity of the lifters used in that step.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have boxes with weights: [12, 90, 67, 10, 10, 94, 60, 46]\n2. We have lifters with capacities: [56, 77, 72]\n\nThe strategy is to:\n- Sort the boxes in descending order to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n- Try to lift the heaviest boxes using the available lifters, combining their capacities if necessary.\n- Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [12, 90, 67, 10, 10, 94, 60, 46]\nlifters = [56, 77, 72]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(4):\n    step_lift = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step_lift.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters to lift the box\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        step_lift.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lift)\n    \n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, using the minimum number of steps. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution for lifting all the boxes in 4 steps. Let's interpret the output:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Box weighing 94 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1 (combined capacity of 56 + 77 = 133).\n  - Box weighing 46 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 2**: \n  - Box weighing 90 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1 (combined capacity of 56 + 77 = 133).\n  - Box weighing 12 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 3**: \n  - Box weighing 67 is lifted by lifter 0.\n  - Box weighing 60 is lifted by lifter 1.\n  - Box weighing 10 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 4**: \n  - Box weighing 10 is lifted by lifter 0.\n\nThis solution uses all available lifters efficiently and completes the task in 4 steps, which is within the allowed limit.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(94, [0, 1]), (46, [2])]\nStep 2: [(90, [0, 1]), (12, [2])]\nStep 3: [(67, [0]), (60, [1]), (10, [2])]\nStep 4: [(10, [0])]\n>>>"
