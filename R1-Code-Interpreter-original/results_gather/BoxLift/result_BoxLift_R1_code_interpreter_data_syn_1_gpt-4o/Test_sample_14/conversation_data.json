    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes, and we need to ensure that all boxes are lifted in 10 or fewer steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [364, 138, 172, 200, 44, 194, 195, 282, 189, 400, 233, 307, 71, 300, 306, 346, 61, 136, 168, 392, 97, 367, 118, 354]\nlifters = [54, 124, 186, 103, 122, 112]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                    break\n        \n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n    \n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    for box, _ in step:\n        boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n    if len(steps) > 10:\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes using the minimum number of steps, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 10 or fewer steps.
