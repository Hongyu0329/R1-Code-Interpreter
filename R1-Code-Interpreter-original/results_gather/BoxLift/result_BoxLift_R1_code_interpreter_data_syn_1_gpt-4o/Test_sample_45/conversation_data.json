    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We have to consider the constraints that lifters can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nLet's start by sorting the boxes and lifters to facilitate the assignment process. We'll try to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are more likely to require multiple lifters. We'll also try to use the strongest lifters first to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n3. In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first using the available lifters.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring it takes no more than 3 steps.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [100, 22, 67, 79, 32, 31, 67, 37]\nlifters = [58, 78, 68, 75]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_lifting = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                remaining_weight = 0\n                break\n        \n        if remaining_weight > 0:\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    remaining_weight -= lifter\n                    if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                        break\n        \n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step_lifting.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_boxes[i] = True\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n    \n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\nprint(steps)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the process is completed in the minimum number of steps possible, with a maximum of 3 steps. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code output indicates that not all boxes have been lifted, and the solution is not optimal. Let's re-evaluate the approach and ensure that all boxes are lifted within the constraints.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2.
