    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the rules provided. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes while ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 8 or fewer steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of which lifters are used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [351, 64, 363, 78, 283, 68, 211, 200, 288, 295, 319, 271, 305, 219, 310, 365, 390, 56, 396, 332, 130, 136, 221, 386]\nlifters = [134, 184, 163, 144, 109, 179, 64]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity < box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            \n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        \n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the solution is as efficient as possible within the constraints. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the solution requires 9 steps, which exceeds the maximum allowed 8 steps. We need to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes to fit within the 8-step constraint.\n\nTo achieve this, we can try to optimize the distribution of lifters more effectively, especially for the lighter boxes, to ensure that we can lift all boxes within the 8-step limit. Let's adjust the strategy to better utilize the lifters' capacities, especially in the later steps where lighter boxes are involved.\n\nHere's an updated approach:\n1. Prioritize lifting heavier boxes first, as before.\n2. For lighter boxes, try to use fewer lifters or combine smaller boxes in a single step to maximize the number of boxes lifted per step.\n3.
