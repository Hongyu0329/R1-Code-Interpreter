Multiple lifters can combine together to lift one box if the box is too heavy for a single lifter.\n5. Try to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps possible.\n6.

    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 7 steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting heavier boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of which lifters are used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [280, 392, 142, 400, 213, 135, 295, 142, 55, 371, 151, 50, 42, 281, 283, 46, 383, 352, 204, 111]\nlifters = [143, 62, 162, 128, 141, 159]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if not boxes:\n            break\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the current box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark this box as lifted\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box in boxes if box is not None]\n    steps.append(step)\n    if len(steps) > 7:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift all boxes in the minimum number of steps, ensuring that each step adheres to the rules provided.
