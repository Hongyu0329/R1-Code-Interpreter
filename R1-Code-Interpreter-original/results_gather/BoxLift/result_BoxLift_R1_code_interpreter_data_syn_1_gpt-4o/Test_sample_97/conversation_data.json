    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step using the available lifters optimally. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes, and we need to ensure that all boxes are lifted in 6 or fewer steps.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to use the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of which boxes have been lifted and which lifters have been used in each step.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [184, 93, 275, 216, 137, 181, 31, 79, 56, 138, 81, 205, 108, 193, 230, 252]\nlifters = [47, 157, 156, 45, 151, 51]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n\nwhile remaining_boxes and len(steps) < 6:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        \n        for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and total_capacity < box:\n                lifter_indices.append(i)\n                total_capacity += capacity\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n            \n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        \n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, given the constraints. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution that lifts all the boxes in 6 steps, adhering to the constraints. Each step uses the available lifters optimally to lift the heaviest boxes first, combining lifters when necessary.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(275, [0, 1]), (252, [2, 3, 4, 5])]\nStep 2: [(230, [0, 1]), (216, [2, 3, 4])]\nStep 3: [(205, [0, 1]), (193, [2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(184, [0, 1]), (181, [2, 3])]\nStep 5: [(138, [0]), (137, [1]), (108, [2]), (93, [3, 4])]\nStep 6: [(81, [0]), (79, [1]), (56, [2]), (31, [3])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution ensures that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible, given the constraints."
