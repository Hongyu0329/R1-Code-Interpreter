    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have boxes with weights: [21, 96, 83, 73, 100, 73, 55, 25]\n2. We have lifters with capacities: [62, 79, 54]\n\nThe strategy is to:\n- First, try to lift the heaviest boxes using combinations of lifters.\n- Use individual lifters for boxes they can lift alone.\n- Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [21, 96, 83, 73, 100, 73, 55, 25]\nlifters = [62, 79, 54]\n\n# Function to find the best combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return None\n\n# Function to assign lifters to boxes in steps\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    remaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n    \n    while remaining_boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = set()\n        \n        for box_weight in sorted(remaining_boxes, reverse=True):\n            lifter_indices = find_lifter_combination(box_weight, [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters])\n            if lifter_indices is not None:\n                step.append((box_weight, lifter_indices))\n                used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n        \n        # Remove lifted boxes\n        for box_weight, _ in step:\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box_weight)\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n    \n    return steps\n\n# Get the steps\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps, 1):\n    print(f\"Step {i}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis script will determine the optimal way to assign lifters to boxes in steps, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible.

Additionally, the code should ensure that each lifter is used only once per step and that the solution is optimal.\n\nLet's refine the approach:\n\n1.
