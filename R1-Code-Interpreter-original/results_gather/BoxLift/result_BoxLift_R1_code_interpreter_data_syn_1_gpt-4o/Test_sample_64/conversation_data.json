    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n4. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 14.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [45, 139, 291, 189, 171, 265, 139, 312, 289, 394, 183, 229, 321, 250, 226, 335, 59, 127, 298, 339, 256, 161, 288, 179]\nlifters = [52, 99, 86, 56, 92, 134]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark the box as lifted\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box in boxes if box is not None]\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 14.

    "It seems the code execution timed out, likely due to an inefficient approach in finding the optimal combination of lifters for each box. Let's refine the strategy to ensure it runs efficiently within the time constraints.\n\nTo improve efficiency, we can:\n1. Use a greedy approach to assign lifters to boxes, starting with the heaviest box and the strongest available lifters.\n2. Use a more efficient method to find combinations of lifters that can lift a box, such as a backtracking approach with pruning.\n\nLet's implement this refined approach:\n\n```python\nboxes = [45, 139, 291, 189, 171, 265, 139, 312, 289, 394, 183, 229, 321, 250, 226, 335, 59, 127, 298, 339, 256, 161, 288, 179]\nlifters = [52, 99, 86, 56, 92, 134]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\n\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, lifters, used):\n    # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n    lifter_indices = []\n    remaining_weight = box_weight\n    for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n            lifter_indices.append(j)\n            remaining_weight -= lifter\n            used[j] = True\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            return lifter_indices\n    return None\n\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        lifter_indices = find_lifter_combination(box, lifters, used_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark the box as lifted\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box in boxes if box is not None]\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code should be more efficient in finding the optimal solution.

    "The timeout issue suggests that the current approach is still not efficient enough. Let's try a different strategy to ensure the code runs within the time constraints. We can use a more direct approach to assign lifters to boxes by iterating through the boxes and attempting to lift them with available lifters in a greedy manner.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n3. For each box, try to lift it using the available lifters, starting with the strongest.\n4.
