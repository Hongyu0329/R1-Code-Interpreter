    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps does not exceed 11.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [187, 344, 112, 66, 384, 247, 184, 298, 131, 51, 62, 255, 120, 357, 399, 287, 231, 161, 336, 256, 328, 239, 365, 245]\nlifters = [165, 85, 52, 82, 114, 75]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if total_capacity < box:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                total_capacity += lifter\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            # Assign the lifters to this box\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Remove the used lifters\n            for i in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                del remaining_lifters[i]\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters.

Let's refine the approach:\n\n1. Prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Use the strongest lifters first and try to combine them efficiently to lift heavier boxes.\n3.
