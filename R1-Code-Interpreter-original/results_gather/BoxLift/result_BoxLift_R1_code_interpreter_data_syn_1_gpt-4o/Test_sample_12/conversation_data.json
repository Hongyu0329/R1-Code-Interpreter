    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. The constraints allow us to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes, and we need to ensure that all boxes are lifted in 12 steps or fewer.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to maximize the lifting potential in each step.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of the steps and the assignments of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [50, 219, 120, 245, 204, 172, 274, 225, 94, 270, 158, 253, 174, 40, 252, 124]\nlifters = [54, 61, 106, 60, 63]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        used_lifters = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n            if total_capacity < box:\n                used_lifters.append(i)\n                total_capacity += lifter\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            # Assign this box to the lifters\n            step.append((box, used_lifters))\n            # Remove used lifters\n            for i in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                del remaining_lifters[i]\n            # Remove the box from the list\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code output shows the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters. Each step lists the boxes being lifted and the indices of the lifters used. The solution fits within the constraint of 12 steps.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(274, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (50, [0])]\nStep 2: [(270, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (40, [0])]\nStep 3: [(253, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 4: [(252, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 5: [(245, [0, 1, 2, 3])]\nStep 6: [(225, [0, 1, 2]), (94, [0, 1])]\nStep 7: [(219, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 8: [(204, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 9: [(174, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 10: [(172, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 11: [(158, [0, 1]), (124, [0, 1, 2])]\nStep 12: [(120, [0, 1])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution efficiently assigns lifters to boxes, ensuring all boxes are lifted within the given constraints."
