    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nboxes = [196, 90, 142, 22, 143, 101, 43, 166, 79, 129, 77, 187]\nlifters = [71, 58, 104, 105]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark the box as lifted\n    boxes = [b for b in boxes if b is not None]  # Remove lifted boxes\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to lift the boxes in the most efficient way possible, given the constraints. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "It seems the code took too long to execute, likely due to an inefficient approach in finding combinations of lifters for each box. Let's optimize the approach by using a more efficient method to find combinations of lifters that can lift each box. We can use a recursive function to find valid combinations of lifters for each box.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Use a recursive function to find combinations of lifters that can lift a given box.\n2. For each box, try to find the smallest combination of lifters that can lift it.\n3. Assign lifters to boxes in each step, ensuring that each lifter is used only once per step.\n4. Repeat until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this optimized approach in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [196, 90, 142, 22, 143, 101, 43, 166, 79, 129, 77, 187]\nlifters = [71, 58, 104, 105]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\n\ndef find_lifter_combination(box_weight, lifters):\n    # Try to find the smallest combination of lifters that can lift the box\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(lifters, r):\n            if sum(combo) >= box_weight:\n                return combo\n    return None\n\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        available_lifters = [l for j, l in enumerate(lifters) if not used_lifters[j]]\n        lifter_combo = find_lifter_combination(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_combo:\n            lifter_indices = [lifters.index(l) for l in lifter_combo]\n            for idx in lifter_indices:\n                used_lifters[idx] = True\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes[i] = None  # Mark the box as lifted\n    boxes = [b for b in boxes if b is not None]  # Remove lifted boxes\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis code should be more efficient in finding the optimal solution. Let's execute it to see the result.",
