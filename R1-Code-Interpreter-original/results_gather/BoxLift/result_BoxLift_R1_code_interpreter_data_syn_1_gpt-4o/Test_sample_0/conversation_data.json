    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have boxes with weights: [18, 93, 23, 70, 72, 22, 96, 96]\n2. We have lifters with capacities: [60, 46, 61]\n\nThe strategy is to:\n- First, try to assign boxes to individual lifters if possible.\n- If a box is too heavy for any single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n- Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring the number of steps is minimized.\n\nLet's write a Python script to determine the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes:\n\n```python\nboxes = [18, 93, 23, 70, 72, 22, 96, 96]\nlifters = [60, 46, 61]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to try to lift the heaviest boxes first\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to use the strongest lifters first\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no single lifter can lift the box, try to combine lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    break\n    \n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    for box, _ in step:\n        boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    print(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to lift the heaviest boxes first, using the strongest lifters available, and will combine lifters if necessary. Let's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution that lifts all the boxes in 5 steps, which is within the required limit. The solution involves combining lifters to lift heavier boxes and using individual lifters for lighter boxes when possible.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(96, [0, 1]), (23, [2])]\nStep 2: [(96, [0, 1]), (22, [2])]\nStep 3: [(93, [0, 1]), (18, [2])]\nStep 4: [(72, [0, 1])]\nStep 5: [(70, [0, 1])]\n>>>\n\nThis solution efficiently assigns lifters to boxes, ensuring all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible given the constraints."
