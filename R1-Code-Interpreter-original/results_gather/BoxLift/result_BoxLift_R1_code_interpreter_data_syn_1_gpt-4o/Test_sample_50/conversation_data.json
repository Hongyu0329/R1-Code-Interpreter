    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with each step adhering to the given rules. The key challenge is to efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes and ensure that all boxes are lifted within 4 steps.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Heaviest Boxes**: Start by attempting to lift the heaviest boxes first, as they are the most restrictive in terms of lifter combinations.\n\n2. **Combine Lifters for Heavy Boxes**: If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Optimize Lifter Usage**: Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step and try to maximize the number of boxes lifted in each step.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Steps**: Repeat the process for subsequent steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Box weights and lifter capacities\nboxes = [92, 26, 84, 55, 72, 48, 33, 19]\nlifters = [64, 48, 63]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order to prioritize heavier boxes\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Sort lifters in descending order to prioritize stronger lifters\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to find the optimal lifting plan\ndef find_lifting_plan(boxes, lifters):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n            # Try to lift the box with available lifters\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [j]))\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try to combine lifters if a single lifter can't lift the box\n                for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        continue\n                    for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                        if used_lifters[k]:\n                            continue\n                        if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                            step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                            used_lifters[j] = True\n                            used_lifters[k] = True\n                            boxes.remove(box)\n                            break\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        break\n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 4:\n            return \"Not possible to lift all boxes in 4 steps\"\n    return steps\n\n# Find the lifting plan\nlifting_plan = find_lifting_plan(boxes, lifters)\n\n# Print the lifting plan\nprint(lifting_plan)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the optimal lifting plan.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a lifting plan that fits within the constraints of 4 steps. Let's interpret the output:\n\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Box weighing 92 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1.\n  - Box weighing 48 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 2**: \n  - Box weighing 84 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1.\n  - Box weighing 33 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 3**: \n  - Box weighing 72 is lifted by lifters 0 and 1.\n  - Box weighing 26 is lifted by lifter 2.\n\n- **Step 4**: \n  - Box weighing 55 is lifted by lifter 0.\n  - Box weighing 19 is lifted by lifter 1.\n\nThis plan ensures that all boxes are lifted within 4 steps, adhering to the rules provided.\n\n<<<\nStep 1: [(92, [0, 1]), (48, [2])]\nStep 2: [(84, [0, 1]), (33, [2])]\nStep 3: [(72, [0, 1]), (26, [2])]\nStep 4: [(55, [0]), (19, [1])]\n>>>"
