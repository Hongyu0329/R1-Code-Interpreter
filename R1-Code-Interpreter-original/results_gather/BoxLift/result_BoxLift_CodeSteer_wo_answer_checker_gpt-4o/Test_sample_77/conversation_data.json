    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combination of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available boxes to the available lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\n4. **Output the steps**: For each step, output the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [253, 162, 171, 57, 68, 142, 196, 83, 94, 287, 256, 236, 153, 79, 111, 42]\nlifters = [61, 62, 122, 75, 143, 131]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity + lifter <= box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if total_capacity >= box:\n                    break\n        \n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n    if len(steps) > 6:\n        break\n\n# Output the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 6.",
    "To address the problem more effectively, we can use a greedy approach with backtracking to ensure that we efficiently assign lifters to boxes while adhering to the constraints.

This helps in prioritizing the heaviest boxes and the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Use a greedy approach with backtracking**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available boxes to the available lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it. Use backtracking to explore different combinations of lifters if the initial assignment does not work.\n\n3. **Track used lifters**: Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\n5. **Output the steps**: For each step, output the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [253, 162, 171, 57, 68, 142, 196, 83, 94, 287, 256, 236, 153, 79, 111, 42]\nlifters = [61, 62, 122, 75, 143, 131]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\n\ndef can_lift(box, lifters, used):\n    # Try to find a combination of lifters that can lift the box\n    lifter_indices = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n    for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used[i] and total_capacity + lifter <= box:\n            total_capacity += lifter\n            lifter_indices.append(i)\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                return lifter_indices\n    return None\n\nwhile boxes and len(steps) < 6:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = can_lift(box, lifters, used_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            for index in lifter_indices:\n                used_lifters[index] = True\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Output the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code attempts to lift the heaviest boxes first using the strongest available lifters, combining them if necessary.
