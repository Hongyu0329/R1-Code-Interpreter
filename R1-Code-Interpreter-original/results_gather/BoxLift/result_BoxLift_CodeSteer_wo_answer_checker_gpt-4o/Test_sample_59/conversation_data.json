    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try and match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the available lifters to the heaviest remaining boxes.

Use a combination of lifters to match or exceed the weight of each box. If a single lifter can lift a box, assign it directly. Otherwise, combine lifters starting from the strongest available.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters are used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: For each step, output the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used.\n\nLet's implement this optimized approach in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [299, 338, 270, 207, 76, 195, 101, 89, 277, 236, 240, 342, 47, 207, 220, 349, 185, 124, 309, 112, 266, 278, 162, 119]\nlifters = [198, 55, 76, 137, 163, 117, 146]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity + lifter <= box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if total_capacity == box:\n                    break\n        \n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Output the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code attempts to lift the heaviest boxes first by combining lifters efficiently, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized.
