    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This way, we can try to lift the heaviest boxes first, which are more challenging to lift.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their lifting capacities. This allows us to use the strongest lifters first, which is efficient for lifting heavier boxes.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of which boxes have been lifted and which lifters have been used in each step.\n5. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [99, 159, 55, 86, 215, 56, 271, 167, 212, 87, 78, 211, 246, 153, 227, 287]\nlifters = [143, 50, 70, 79, 136]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity + lifter <= box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if total_capacity == box:\n                    break\n        \n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 7.",

    "To tackle this problem more effectively, we can use a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) approach. This involves defining the problem in terms of variables, domains, and constraints, and then using a solver to find a solution that satisfies all constraints. In this case, the variables are the boxes, the domains are the possible combinations of lifters, and the constraints are the lifting capacities and the maximum number of steps.\n\nHere's how we can approach this problem using a CSP-like strategy with a greedy heuristic:\n\n1. **Variables**: Each box is a variable that needs to be lifted.\n2. **Domains**: The domain for each box is the set of possible combinations of lifters that can lift it.\n3. **Constraints**: \n   - Each lifter can only be used once per step.\n   - The total weight lifted in each step should not exceed the combined capacity of the lifters used.\n   - The total number of steps should not exceed 7.\n\n4. **Heuristic**: Use a greedy approach to select the heaviest box that can be lifted in each step, using the most efficient combination of available lifters.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [99, 159, 55, 86, 215, 56, 271, 167, 212, 87, 78, 211, 246, 153, 227, 287]\nlifters = [143, 50, 70, 79, 136]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\ndef find_lifter_combinations(lifters, box_weight):\n    # Find all combinations of lifters that can lift the box\n    for r in range(1, len(lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(lifters), r):\n            indices, weights = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(weights) >= box_weight:\n                return list(indices)\n    return None\n\ndef solve_box_lift(boxes, lifters, max_steps):\n    steps = []\n    while boxes and len(steps) < max_steps:\n        step = []\n        used = [False] * len(lifters)\n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            lifter_indices = find_lifter_combinations([l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if not used[i]], box)\n            if lifter_indices is not None:\n                step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                boxes.remove(box)\n                for index in lifter_indices:\n                    used[index] = True\n        if step:\n            steps.append(step)\n        else:\n            break\n\n    if not boxes:\n        output = []\n        for i, step in enumerate(steps):\n            output.append(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n        print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found within the given steps.\")\n\nsolve_box_lift(boxes, lifters, 7)\n```\n\nThis code uses a combination of greedy and CSP-like strategies to find a solution.
