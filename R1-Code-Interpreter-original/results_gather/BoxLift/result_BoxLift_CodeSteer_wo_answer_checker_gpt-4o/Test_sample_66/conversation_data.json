    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This way, we can try to lift the heaviest boxes first, which might require more lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their lifting capacities. This will help us use the strongest lifters first, which is efficient for lifting heavier boxes.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes:\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - Once a box is lifted, mark the lifters as used for that step.\n   - Continue this process until no more boxes can be lifted in the current step.\n4. Repeat the process for the next step until all boxes are lifted.\n5. Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes = sorted(boxes, reverse=True)\n    lifters = sorted(lifters, reverse=True)\n    steps = []\n    \n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        \n        for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n            if not boxes[i]:\n                continue\n            lifter_indices = []\n            remaining_weight = box\n            \n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    remaining_weight -= lifter\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                        break\n            \n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                boxes[i] = 0\n        \n        boxes = [box for box in boxes if box > 0]\n        steps.append(step)\n        \n        if len(steps) > 8:\n            return \"Cannot lift all boxes in 8 steps or less.\"\n    \n    return steps\n\nboxes = [181, 52, 82, 130, 92, 195, 101, 106, 189, 42, 196, 46]\nlifters = [45, 30, 52, 104, 30]\n\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 8.",
    "To solve this problem efficiently within the constraint of 8 steps, we can use a backtracking approach. This approach will allow us to explore different combinations of lifters for each box and find the optimal assignment that minimizes the number of steps.\n\nHere's the plan for the backtracking approach:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2.
