    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Initialize Steps**: Create a list to store the steps, where each step is a list of tuples representing the boxes and the lifters assigned to them.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available boxes to the available lifters:\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - If a single lifter can lift a box, assign it directly.\n   - If not, try to combine lifters to match or exceed the box's weight.\n   - Mark the lifters as used for the current step once they are assigned to a box.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning boxes to lifters in steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Print the steps in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [12, 90, 67, 10, 10, 94, 60, 46]\nlifters = [56, 77, 72]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    remaining_boxes = []\n\n    for box in boxes:\n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n\n        for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and total_capacity < box:\n                lifter_indices.append(i)\n                total_capacity += capacity\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n        else:\n            remaining_boxes.append(box)\n\n    steps.append(step)\n    boxes = remaining_boxes\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that all constraints are met and the number of steps is minimized.",
    "To further optimize the solution, we can use a backtracking approach. This method will allow us to explore different combinations of lifters for each box and backtrack if a particular combination does not lead to a solution within the given constraints. The goal is to minimize the number of steps while ensuring all boxes are lifted.\n\nHere's how we can implement a backtracking approach:\n\n1. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that tries to assign lifters to boxes. The function will attempt to lift the heaviest box first and use backtracking to explore different combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Base Case**: If all boxes are lifted, record the current step configuration.\n\n3. **Recursive Case**: For each box, try to assign a combination of lifters that can lift it. If a valid combination is found, mark those lifters as used for the current step and proceed to the next box.\n\n4. **Backtrack**: If a combination does not lead to a solution, backtrack by unmarking the lifters and trying a different combination.\n\n5. **Track Minimum Steps**: Keep track of the minimum number of steps found during the exploration.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [12, 90, 67, 10, 10, 94, 60, 46]\nlifters = [56, 77, 72]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\ndef can_lift(box, lifters, used):\n    lifter_indices = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n    for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used[i] and total_capacity < box:\n            lifter_indices.append(i)\n            total_capacity += capacity\n            used[i] = True\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            return lifter_indices\n    return None\n\ndef backtrack(boxes, lifters, step, steps, used):\n    if not boxes:\n        steps.append(step.copy())\n        return True\n\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        lifter_indices = can_lift(box, lifters, used)\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            remaining_boxes = boxes[:i] + boxes[i+1:]\n            if backtrack(remaining_boxes, lifters, step, steps, used):\n                return True\n            step.pop()\n            for index in lifter_indices:\n                used[index] = False\n\n    return False\n\nsteps = []\nused = [False] * len(lifters)\nbacktrack(boxes, lifters, [], steps, used)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters for each box.
