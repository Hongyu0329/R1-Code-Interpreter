    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This helps in tackling the heaviest boxes first, which might require multiple lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities. This allows us to use the strongest lifters first, which is efficient for lifting heavier boxes.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes:\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - Once a box is assigned lifters, mark those lifters as used for that step.\n   - Move to the next heaviest box and repeat until no more boxes can be lifted in that step.\n4. Repeat the process for subsequent steps until all boxes are lifted.\n5. Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n    steps = []\n    \n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        \n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            lifter_indices = []\n            remaining_weight = box\n            \n            for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[i] and remaining_weight > 0:\n                    if capacity <= remaining_weight:\n                        lifter_indices.append(i)\n                        remaining_weight -= capacity\n                        used_lifters[i] = True\n            \n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                boxes.remove(box)\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 4:\n            return \"Not possible to lift all boxes in 4 steps or less.\"\n    \n    return steps\n\nboxes = [17, 69, 16, 83, 95, 91, 68, 25]\nlifters = [42, 68, 50, 48]\n\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4.",

Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to use the strongest lifters first.\n3. Use a backtracking approach to try different combinations of lifters for each box:\n   - For each box, try to find a combination of available lifters that can lift it.\n   - If a valid combination is found, mark those lifters as used for the current step.\n   - Move to the next box and repeat the process.\n4. If all boxes are lifted within 4 steps, return the solution. If not, backtrack and try different combinations.\n5.
