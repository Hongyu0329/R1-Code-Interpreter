    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the available lifters to the heaviest boxes they can lift. If a box is too heavy for any single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\n4. **Output the Steps**: Format the output to show which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [14, 51, 14, 69, 77, 20, 52, 96]\nlifters = [69, 66, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(4):\n    step_lift = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step_lift.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters to lift the box\n            total_capacity = 0\n            lifter_indices = []\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j]:\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        step_lift.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        for idx in lifter_indices:\n                            used_lifters[idx] = True\n                        break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lift)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\noutput = \"\\n\".join(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\" for i, step in enumerate(steps))\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4.",

    "The current solution effectively uses a systematic search approach to assign lifters to boxes while adhering to the constraints. The code successfully minimizes the number of steps and ensures all boxes are lifted within the given limit. Since the solution is correct and efficient, you can proceed with this answer."
