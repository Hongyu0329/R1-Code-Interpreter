    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This way, we can try to lift the heaviest boxes first, which might require combining multiple lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their lifting capacities. This will help us efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by:\n   - Starting with the heaviest box and finding the combination of available lifters that can lift it.\n   - Mark the lifters used in this step as unavailable for the rest of the step.\n   - Repeat until no more boxes can be lifted in the current step.\n4. Repeat the process for subsequent steps until all boxes are lifted.\n5. Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n    steps = []\n    \n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifters[:]\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        \n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            for i in range(len(available_lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[i]:\n                    continue\n                if available_lifters[i] >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [i]))\n                    used_lifters[i] = True\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try to combine lifters\n                total_capacity = 0\n                lifter_indices = []\n                for i in range(len(available_lifters)):\n                    if not used_lifters[i]:\n                        total_capacity += available_lifters[i]\n                        lifter_indices.append(i)\n                        if total_capacity >= box:\n                            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                            for idx in lifter_indices:\n                                used_lifters[idx] = True\n                            boxes.remove(box)\n                            break\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 7:\n            return \"Cannot lift all boxes in 7 steps or less.\"\n    \n    return steps\n\nboxes = [190, 107, 357, 385, 343, 392, 97, 277, 231, 77, 147, 138, 371, 303, 173, 397, 123, 72, 241, 291]\nlifters = [100, 70, 149, 198, 118, 100, 153]\n\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 7."
