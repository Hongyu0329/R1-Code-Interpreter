    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combination of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign lifters to boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available box to the available lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat until all boxes are lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\n4. **Output the steps**: Format the output as specified, showing which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef box_lift():\n    boxes = [92, 26, 84, 55, 72, 48, 33, 19]\n    lifters = [64, 48, 63]\n\n    # Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    steps = []\n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        \n        for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [j]))\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try to combine lifters if a single one can't lift the box\n                for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        continue\n                    for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                        if used_lifters[k]:\n                            continue\n                        if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                            step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                            used_lifters[j] = True\n                            used_lifters[k] = True\n                            boxes.remove(box)\n                            break\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        break\n\n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 4:\n            break\n\n    # Print the steps\n    result = \"\"\n    for i, step in enumerate(steps):\n        result += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\n    print(f\"<<<{result.strip()}>>>\")\n\nbox_lift()\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 4."
