    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try and match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Greedy Assignment**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes. Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it. Once a box is lifted, move to the next heaviest box.\n\n3. **Combination of Lifters**: If a single lifter cannot lift a box, try to combine multiple lifters to lift it. Use a greedy approach to find the smallest number of lifters that can lift the box.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, keeping track of the number of steps.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: For each step, output the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef box_lift(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n    steps = []\n    \n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        available_lifters = lifters[:]\n        i = 0\n        \n        while i < len(boxes):\n            box = boxes[i]\n            used_lifters = []\n            total_capacity = 0\n            \n            for j, lifter in enumerate(available_lifters):\n                if total_capacity < box:\n                    used_lifters.append(j)\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n            \n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                step.append((box, used_lifters))\n                for index in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                    del available_lifters[index]\n                del boxes[i]\n            else:\n                i += 1\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n    \n    return steps\n\nboxes = [215, 113, 62, 255, 246, 148, 283, 149, 295, 250, 114, 48, 245, 145, 153, 50]\nlifters = [82, 55, 159, 56, 88]\n\nsteps = box_lift(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized.",
    "To address the problem more effectively, we can use a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters and boxes. This approach will allow us to find a solution that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the constraint of lifting all boxes in 11 steps or fewer.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Recursive Backtracking**: Use a recursive function to try different combinations of lifters for each box. This function will attempt to lift each box using available lifters and backtrack if a solution is not feasible.\n\n2. **Pruning**: If the number of steps exceeds 11, stop exploring that path. This will help in reducing the search space.\n\n3. **Combination of Lifters**: For each box, try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, try to combine multiple lifters.\n\n4. **Track Best Solution**: Keep track of the best solution found (i.e., the one with the fewest steps).\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Once the best solution is found, output the steps.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_lift(box, lifters, used):\n    total_capacity = 0\n    indices = []\n    for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used[i] and total_capacity < box:\n            total_capacity += lifter\n            indices.append(i)\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            return indices\n    return None\n\ndef backtrack(boxes, lifters, used, step, steps, best_steps):\n    if step >= len(best_steps):\n        return\n    if not boxes:\n        if step < len(best_steps):\n            best_steps.clear()\n            best_steps.extend(steps)\n        return\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        indices = can_lift(box, lifters, used)\n        if indices is not None:\n            for index in indices:\n                used[index] = True\n            steps.append((box, indices))\n            backtrack(boxes[:i] + boxes[i+1:], lifters, used, step + 1, steps, best_steps)\n            steps.pop()\n            for index in indices:\n                used[index] = False\n\ndef box_lift(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n    used = [False] * len(lifters)\n    best_steps = [None] * 12  # More than the max allowed steps\n    backtrack(boxes, lifters, used, 0, [], best_steps)\n    return best_steps\n\nboxes = [215, 113, 62, 255, 246, 148, 283, 149, 295, 250, 114, 48, 245, 145, 153, 50]\nlifters = [82, 55, 159, 56, 88]\n\nsteps = box_lift(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    if step is not None:\n        output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters and boxes, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the number of steps while ensuring all boxes are lifted in 11 steps or fewer.",
