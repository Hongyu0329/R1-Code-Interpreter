    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This way, we can try to lift the heaviest boxes first, which might require combining multiple lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their lifting capacities. This will help us efficiently combine lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes:\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - Once a box is lifted, mark the lifters as used for that step.\n   - Continue this process until no more boxes can be lifted in the current step.\n4. Repeat the process for the next step until all boxes are lifted.\n5.
