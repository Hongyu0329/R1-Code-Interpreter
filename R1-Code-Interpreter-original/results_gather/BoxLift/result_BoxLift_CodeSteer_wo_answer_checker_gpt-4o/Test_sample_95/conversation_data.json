    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We need to consider the constraints of lifter capacities and the ability to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to use the strongest lifters first.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by:\n   - Assigning a single lifter to a box if the lifter's capacity is sufficient.\n   - Combining multiple lifters to lift a box if necessary.\n4. Repeat the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 3.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [79, 48, 16, 95, 67, 41, 62, 22]\nlifters = [52, 41, 41, 67]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_lifts = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step_lifts.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters for the box\n            total_capacity = 0\n            lifter_indices = []\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j]:\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        step_lifts.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        for idx in lifter_indices:\n                            used_lifters[idx] = True\n                        break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifts)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\n# Format the output\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    step_str = f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\"\n    output.append(step_str)\n\nresult = \"\\n\".join(output)\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the process is completed in the minimum number of steps possible, with a maximum of 3 steps."
