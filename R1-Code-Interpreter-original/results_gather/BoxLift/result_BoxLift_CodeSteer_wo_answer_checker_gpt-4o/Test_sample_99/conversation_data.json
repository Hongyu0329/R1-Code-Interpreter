    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combination of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available boxes to the available lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step to ensure they are not reused in the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Format the output as specified, showing which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [289, 375, 107, 145, 257, 48, 141, 83, 136, 368, 59, 133, 186, 266, 353, 73, 66, 210, 247, 79, 342, 318, 337, 162]\nlifters = [75, 189, 162, 181, 118, 194, 137]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 7.",

Use a greedy approach to select lifters that can lift the box with the least number of lifters, and prune combinations that exceed the box weight.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters are used in each step to ensure they are not reused in the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Format the output as specified.\n\nLet's implement this optimized approach in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [289, 375, 107, 145, 257, 48, 141, 83, 136, 368, 59, 133, 186, 266, 353, 73, 66, 210, 247, 79, 342, 318, 337, 162]\nlifters = [75, 189, 162, 181, 118, 194, 137]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                remaining_weight -= lifter\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                break\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n    if len(steps) > 7:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code attempts to lift the heaviest boxes first by combining the strongest available lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 7.

This helps in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes first.\n\n2. **Backtracking Function**: Implement a recursive function that tries to assign lifters to boxes. The function should:\n   - Check if the current assignment is valid (i.e., the combined capacity of selected lifters meets or exceeds the box weight).\n   - If valid, move to the next box.\n   - If not valid, try different combinations of lifters.\n   - Use pruning to skip combinations that cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Check Step Limit**: Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Format the output as specified.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [289, 375, 107, 145, 257, 48, 141, 83, 136, 368, 59, 133, 186, 266, 353, 73, 66, 210, 247, 79, 342, 318, 337, 162]\nlifters = [75, 189, 162, 181, 118, 194, 137]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\ndef can_lift(box, lifters, used):\n    # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n    lifter_indices = []\n    remaining_weight = box\n    for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n            lifter_indices.append(j)\n            remaining_weight -= lifter\n            used[j] = True\n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            return lifter_indices\n    return None\n\ndef backtrack(boxes, lifters, step, steps, used):\n    if not boxes:\n        return True\n    if step >= 7:\n        return False\n\n    current_step = []\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = can_lift(box, lifters, used)\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            current_step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n\n    if current_step:\n        steps.append(current_step)\n        if backtrack(boxes, lifters, step + 1, steps, [False] * len(lifters)):\n            return True\n        steps.pop()\n        boxes.extend([box for box, _ in current_step])\n\n    return False\n\nsteps = []\nused = [False] * len(lifters)\nif backtrack(boxes, lifters, 0, steps, used):\n    output = []\n    for i, step in enumerate(steps):\n        output.append(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n    print(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found within 7 steps.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of lifters for each box, ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraint of completing the task in 7 steps or fewer.

    "To improve the solution, we can enhance the backtracking approach by incorporating more effective pruning strategies and exploring alternative combinations of lifters more thoroughly.

    "To tackle this problem more effectively, we can use an integer linear programming (ILP) approach. ILP is well-suited for optimization problems with constraints, such as this one, where we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps.\n\nHere's how we can approach this using an ILP solver:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: Create binary variables to represent whether a lifter is used to lift a particular box in a particular step.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: Minimize the number of steps required to lift all boxes.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - Each box must be lifted exactly once.\n   - The total weight lifted by the selected lifters for a box must be at least the weight of the box.\n   - Each lifter can be used at most once per step.\n   - The total number of steps must not exceed 7.\n\n4. **Solve the ILP**: Use an ILP solver to find the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python with the `PuLP` library, which is a popular library for linear programming in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import LpProblem, LpMinimize, LpVariable, lpSum, LpBinary, value\n\nboxes = [289, 375, 107, 145, 257, 48, 141, 83, 136, 368, 59, 133, 186, 266, 353, 73, 66, 210, 247, 79, 342, 318, 337, 162]\nlifters = [75, 189, 162, 181, 118, 194, 137]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Number of boxes and lifters\nnum_boxes = len(boxes)\nnum_lifters = len(lifters)\nmax_steps = 7\n\n# Create the problem\nprob = LpProblem(\"BoxLift\", LpMinimize)\n\n# Create variables\nx = LpVariable.dicts(\"x\", (range(num_boxes), range(num_lifters), range(max_steps)), 0, 1, LpBinary)\n\n# Objective function: minimize the number of steps\nprob += lpSum(x[i][j][k] for i in range(num_boxes) for j in range(num_lifters) for k in range(max_steps))\n\n# Constraints\n# Each box must be lifted exactly once\nfor i in range(num_boxes):\n    prob += lpSum(x[i][j][k] for j in range(num_lifters) for k in range(max_steps)) == 1\n\n# The total weight lifted by the selected lifters for a box must be at least the weight of the box\nfor i in range(num_boxes):\n    for k in range(max_steps):\n        prob += lpSum(lifters[j] * x[i][j][k] for j in range(num_lifters)) >= boxes[i]\n\n# Each lifter can be used at most once per step\nfor j in range(num_lifters):\n    for k in range(max_steps):\n        prob += lpSum(x[i][j][k] for i in range(num_boxes)) <= 1\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Extract the solution\nsteps = [[] for _ in range(max_steps)]\nfor i in range(num_boxes):\n    for j in range(num_lifters):\n        for k in range(max_steps):\n            if value(x[i][j][k]) == 1:\n                steps[k].append((boxes[i], [j]))\n\n# Filter out empty steps and print the result\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    if step:\n        output.append(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the `PuLP` library to define and solve an ILP problem that assigns lifters to boxes while minimizing the number of steps.
