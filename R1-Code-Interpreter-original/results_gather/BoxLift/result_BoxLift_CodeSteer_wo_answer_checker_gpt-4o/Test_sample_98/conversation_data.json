    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This way, we can try to lift the heaviest boxes first, which might require more lifters.\n2. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes.\n3. For each box, check if a single lifter can lift it. If not, try to combine multiple lifters to lift the box.\n4. Keep track of which lifters are used in each step to ensure they are not reused in the same step.\n5.

    "The current approach uses backtracking, which is a step in the right direction, but it still fails to find a valid solution within 6 steps. Consider enhancing the algorithm by implementing a more efficient search strategy, such as dynamic programming or a more advanced combinatorial optimization technique. Focus on optimizing the selection of lifters for each box and ensure that the constraints are strictly adhered to. Additionally, verify that the lifters are correctly marked as used and that the remaining weight is accurately calculated. Aim to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, focusing on efficient searching and correct handling of constraints.",
