    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign lifters to boxes starting from the heaviest box. Use the strongest available lifters to lift the heaviest boxes. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step to ensure they are not reused in the same step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 7.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: For each step, output the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [356, 292, 240, 155, 142, 223, 178, 231, 254, 315, 236, 328, 203, 397, 44, 200, 80, 131, 175, 216]\nlifters = [155, 116, 53, 98, 96, 156, 167]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity + lifter <= box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 7.",
