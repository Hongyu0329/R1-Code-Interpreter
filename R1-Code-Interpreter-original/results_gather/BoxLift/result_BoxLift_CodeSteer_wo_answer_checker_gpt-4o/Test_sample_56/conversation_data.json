    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This helps in tackling the heaviest boxes first, which might require multiple lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities. This allows us to use the strongest lifters first, which is efficient for lifting heavier boxes.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by:\n   - Assigning the heaviest available lifters to the heaviest boxes.\n   - If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to lift it.\n4.
