    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We need to consider the constraints of lifter capacities and the ability to combine lifters to lift heavier boxes.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Initialize Steps**: Create a list to store the steps, where each step is a list of tuples representing the box weight and the indices of the lifters lifting it.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**:\n   - For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible.\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - If a single lifter can lift a box, assign it directly.\n   - If not, try combinations of two or more lifters to lift the box.\n   - Once a box is lifted, mark the lifters as used for that step and move to the next box.\n\n4. **Repeat for Each Step**: Continue the process for up to 3 steps or until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [24, 78, 95, 23, 57, 36, 40, 26]\nlifters = [56, 51, 66, 65]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    for i in range(len(available_lifters)):\n        if available_lifters[i] >= box_weight:\n            return [i]\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(available_lifters)):\n            if available_lifters[i] + available_lifters[j] >= box_weight:\n                return [i, j]\n    return []\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in up to 3 steps\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_lift = []\n    used_lifters = set()\n    for box in boxes:\n        available_lifters = [l for i, l in enumerate(lifters) if i not in used_lifters]\n        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices:\n            step_lift.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n    steps.append(step_lift)\n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box, _ in step_lift if box not in boxes]\n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {[(box, [lifters.index(lifters[i]) for i in lifter_indices]) for box, lifter_indices in step]}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that all constraints are met.",
    "To address the constraints and efficiently minimize the number of steps, we can use a backtracking approach. This approach will systematically explore combinations of lifters for each box while ensuring that each lifter is only used once per step. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Sort the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combinations of lifters.\n\n2. **Backtracking Function**: Create a recursive function that tries to assign lifters to boxes for each step. This function will:\n   - Attempt to lift each box using available lifters.\n   - Use a combination of lifters if a single lifter cannot lift a box.\n   - Track used lifters to ensure they are not reused in the same step.\n   - Backtrack if a solution is not found in the current configuration.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Steps**: Try to lift all boxes in up to 3 steps. If all boxes are lifted before reaching 3 steps, stop.\n\n4. **Output the Steps**: Format the output as specified.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [24, 78, 95, 23, 57, 36, 40, 26]\nlifters = [56, 51, 66, 65]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\n\ndef can_lift(box_weight, lifter_indices):\n    return sum(lifters[i] for i in lifter_indices) >= box_weight\n\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    from itertools import combinations\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(available_lifters, r):\n            if can_lift(box_weight, combo):\n                return combo\n    return []\n\ndef backtrack(step, remaining_boxes, used_lifters):\n    if not remaining_boxes:\n        return True\n    if step >= 3:\n        return False\n\n    step_lift = []\n    available_lifters = [i for i in range(len(lifters)) if i not in used_lifters]\n\n    for box in remaining_boxes:\n        lifter_indices = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices:\n            step_lift.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_lifters.update(lifter_indices)\n            remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n\n    steps.append(step_lift)\n    if backtrack(step + 1, remaining_boxes, set()):\n        return True\n    steps.pop()\n    return False\n\nbacktrack(0, boxes[:], set())\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {[(box, list(lifter_indices)) for box, lifter_indices in step]}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters for each box, ensuring that each lifter is only used once per step.
