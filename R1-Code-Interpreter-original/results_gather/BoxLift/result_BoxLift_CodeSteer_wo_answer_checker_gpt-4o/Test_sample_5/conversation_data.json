    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight to prioritize lifting the heaviest boxes first.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of capacity to utilize the strongest lifters first.\n3. In each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes:\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - If a single lifter can lift a box, assign it to them.\n   - If not, find a combination of lifters whose combined capacity can lift the box.\n   - Repeat until all lifters are assigned or all boxes are lifted in that step.\n4. Repeat the process for the next step until all boxes are lifted.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [38, 74, 55, 11, 82, 43, 34, 20]\nlifters = [76, 78, 46, 63]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nremaining_boxes = boxes[:]\n\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_assignments = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in remaining_boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a single lifter for the box\n        for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and lifter >= box:\n                step_assignments.append((box, [i]))\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n                remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters for the box\n            for i in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[i]:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(i + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[i] + lifters[j] >= box:\n                        step_assignments.append((box, [i, j]))\n                        used_lifters[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        remaining_boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n                if box not in remaining_boxes:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step_assignments)\n    if not remaining_boxes:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 3 or fewer steps."
