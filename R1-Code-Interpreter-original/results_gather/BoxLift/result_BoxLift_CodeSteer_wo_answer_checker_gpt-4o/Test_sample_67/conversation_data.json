    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Initialize Steps**: Create a list to store the steps, where each step is a list of tuples representing the boxes lifted and the lifters used.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign lifters to the heaviest remaining boxes. If a single lifter can lift a box, assign it directly. If not, combine lifters to lift the box.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Ensure Steps Are Within Limit**: Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef box_lift(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n    steps = []\n    \n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n        \n        for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n            if not boxes[i]:\n                continue\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                if lifter >= box:\n                    step.append((box, [j]))\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    boxes[i] = 0\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Try to combine lifters\n                total_capacity = 0\n                lifter_indices = []\n                for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                    if used_lifters[j]:\n                        continue\n                    if total_capacity + lifter >= box:\n                        lifter_indices.append(j)\n                        step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        for idx in lifter_indices:\n                            used_lifters[idx] = True\n                        boxes[i] = 0\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        total_capacity += lifter\n                        lifter_indices.append(j)\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n        boxes = [b for b in boxes if b > 0]\n        if len(steps) > 6:\n            break\n    \n    return steps\n\nboxes = [93, 50, 31, 217, 183, 34, 43, 268, 281, 93, 145, 74, 278, 272, 86, 81]\nlifters = [97, 53, 143, 47, 94, 132]\n\nsteps = box_lift(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 6."
