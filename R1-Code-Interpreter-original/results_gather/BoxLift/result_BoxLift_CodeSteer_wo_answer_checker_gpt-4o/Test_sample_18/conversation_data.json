    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes.

This will help us try to match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Initialize Steps**: Create a list to store the steps, where each step is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a box weight and a list of lifter indices that are lifting that box.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign lifters to the heaviest remaining boxes. Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it. If a single lifter can lift a box, assign it directly. If not, combine lifters until the box can be lifted.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted.
