Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step.\n2. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n3. Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step.\n4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This helps in prioritizing the heaviest boxes first, which might require multiple lifters.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities. This helps in utilizing the strongest lifters first.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes:\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - Once a box is assigned lifters, mark those lifters as used for that step.\n   - Move to the next heaviest box and repeat until no more boxes can be lifted in that step.\n4. Repeat the process for the next step until all boxes are lifted.\n5. Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 4.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [41, 69, 80, 19, 54, 85, 64, 35]\nlifters = [45, 45, 62, 74]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and remaining_weight > 0:\n                if capacity <= remaining_weight:\n                    lifter_indices.append(i)\n                    remaining_weight -= capacity\n                    used_lifters[i] = True\n        \n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 4.",
    "To optimize the solution, we can use a backtracking approach to explore combinations of lifters more effectively. The idea is to recursively try to assign lifters to boxes, backtracking when a combination doesn't work, and keeping track of the minimum number of steps required.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a recursive function to try assigning lifters to boxes.\n2. For each box, try to find a combination of available lifters that can lift it.\n3.
