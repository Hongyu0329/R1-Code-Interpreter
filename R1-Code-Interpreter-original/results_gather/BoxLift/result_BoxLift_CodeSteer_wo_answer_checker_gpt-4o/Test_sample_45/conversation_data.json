    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign lifters to boxes starting from the heaviest box. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to lift it. Ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Repeat for Each Step**: Continue this process for each step until all boxes are lifted or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n\n4. **Output the Steps**: Format the output to show which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [100, 22, 67, 79, 32, 31, 67, 37]\nlifters = [58, 78, 68, 75]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_lifts = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= remaining_weight:\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                remaining_weight = 0\n                break\n        \n        if remaining_weight > 0:\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    remaining_weight -= lifter\n                    if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                        break\n        \n        if remaining_weight <= 0:\n            step_lifts.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_boxes[i] = True\n    \n    steps.append(step_lifts)\n    \n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps possible, with a maximum of 3 steps.",
    "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to ensure that all boxes are lifted within the given constraints using a more strategic approach. We'll use a backtracking algorithm to explore different combinations of lifters for each box and ensure that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Sort the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in attempting to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters for each box. This involves trying different combinations of lifters to lift each box and backtracking if a combination doesn't work.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters and Boxes**: Keep track of which lifters and boxes have been used in each step to ensure that each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n4. **Output the Steps**: Format the output to show which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [100, 22, 67, 79, 32, 31, 67, 37]\nlifters = [58, 78, 68, 75]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\ndef can_lift(box, lifters, used_lifters):\n    lifter_indices = []\n    remaining_weight = box\n    \n    for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used_lifters[i] and lifter >= remaining_weight:\n            lifter_indices.append(i)\n            return lifter_indices\n    \n    for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used_lifters[i] and lifter <= remaining_weight:\n            lifter_indices.append(i)\n            remaining_weight -= lifter\n            if remaining_weight <= 0:\n                return lifter_indices\n    \n    return None\n\ndef backtrack(step, used_boxes, used_lifters, current_steps):\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        return current_steps\n    \n    if step >= 3:\n        return None\n    \n    step_lifts = []\n    new_used_lifters = used_lifters[:]\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        lifter_indices = can_lift(box, lifters, new_used_lifters)\n        \n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            for idx in lifter_indices:\n                new_used_lifters[idx] = True\n            step_lifts.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            used_boxes[i] = True\n    \n    if step_lifts:\n        current_steps.append(step_lifts)\n        result = backtrack(step + 1, used_boxes, [False] * len(lifters), current_steps)\n        if result is not None:\n            return result\n        current_steps.pop()\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        used_boxes[i] = False\n    \n    return None\n\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\nused_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\nsteps = backtrack(0, used_boxes, used_lifters, [])\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters for each box, ensuring that all boxes are lifted within 3 steps.
