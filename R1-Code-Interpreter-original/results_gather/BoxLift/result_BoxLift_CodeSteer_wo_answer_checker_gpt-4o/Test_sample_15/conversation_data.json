    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in a way that minimizes the number of steps while adhering to the given rules. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Initialize Steps**: Create a list to store the steps, where each step is a list of tuples representing the box and the indices of the lifters lifting it.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible:\n   - Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it.\n   - Use a greedy approach to assign the strongest available lifters to the heaviest boxes.\n   - If a single lifter can't lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 3.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Format the output as specified, showing which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [50, 70, 83, 17, 21, 27, 53, 31]\nlifters = [42, 53, 74, 78]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\n\n# Function to find a combination of lifters to lift a box\ndef find_lifters_for_box(box_weight, available_lifters):\n    used_lifters = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n    for i, capacity in enumerate(available_lifters):\n        if total_capacity >= box_weight:\n            break\n        if capacity > 0:\n            used_lifters.append(i)\n            total_capacity += capacity\n            available_lifters[i] = 0  # Mark this lifter as used in this step\n    return used_lifters if total_capacity >= box_weight else None\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in 3 steps\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_lifting = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifters_for_box = find_lifters_for_box(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifters_for_box is not None:\n            step_lifting.append((box, lifters_for_box))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step_lifting)\n    if not boxes:\n        break\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps, ensuring that all rules are followed.",
    "To optimize the solution further, we can use a backtracking approach. This method will allow us to explore different combinations of lifters for each box and backtrack if a particular combination doesn't lead to a solution. This approach is more flexible and can handle edge cases more effectively.\n\nHere's the plan for the backtracking approach:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: As before, sort the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n\n2. **Backtracking Function**: Create a recursive function that tries to assign lifters to boxes. If a box cannot be lifted in the current configuration, backtrack and try a different combination.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters are used in each step to ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n\n4. **Check for Solution**: If all boxes are lifted within 3 steps, return the solution. If not, backtrack and try a different configuration.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that the function can handle cases where a box cannot be lifted by any combination of available lifters.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [50, 70, 83, 17, 21, 27, 53, 31]\nlifters = [42, 53, 74, 78]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Function to try to lift all boxes using backtracking\ndef lift_boxes(boxes, lifters, step, max_steps, current_steps):\n    if not boxes:\n        return current_steps  # All boxes are lifted\n\n    if step >= max_steps:\n        return None  # Exceeded the maximum number of steps\n\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    step_lifting = []\n\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifters_for_box = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n\n        for i, capacity in enumerate(available_lifters):\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n            if capacity > 0:\n                lifters_for_box.append(i)\n                total_capacity += capacity\n                available_lifters[i] = 0  # Mark this lifter as used in this step\n\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step_lifting.append((box, lifters_for_box))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n\n    if step_lifting:\n        current_steps.append(step_lifting)\n        result = lift_boxes(boxes, lifters, step + 1, max_steps, current_steps)\n        if result is not None:\n            return result\n        current_steps.pop()  # Backtrack\n\n    return None\n\n# Try to lift all boxes in 3 steps\nsolution = lift_boxes(boxes[:], lifters, 0, 3, [])\n\n# Format the output\nif solution:\n    output = \"\"\n    for i, step in enumerate(solution):\n        output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\n    print(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"<<<No solution found within 3 steps>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters for each box. It attempts to find a solution within 3 steps and handles cases where a box cannot be lifted by any combination of available lifters."

    "The current solution effectively uses a systematic search approach to assign lifters to boxes while adhering to the rules. However, to further optimize the solution, consider implementing a more advanced algorithm, such as a backtracking or dynamic programming approach, to explore different combinations of lifters more efficiently. This could potentially reduce the complexity and improve the solution's efficiency. Additionally, ensure that the solution is robust and handles edge cases, such as when a box cannot be lifted by any combination of available lifters."
