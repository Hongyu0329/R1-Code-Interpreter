    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes.

This will help us try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the available lifters to the heaviest boxes that can be lifted. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine multiple lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in each step, as they can only be used once per step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 9.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Format the output to show which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [281, 159, 239, 61, 219, 44, 225, 192, 74, 369, 318, 366, 62, 186, 373, 243, 131, 172, 66, 167, 400, 330, 351, 245]\nlifters = [164, 182, 169, 127, 118, 60]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity + lifter >= box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if total_capacity >= box:\n                    break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 9.",
