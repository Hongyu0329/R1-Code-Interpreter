    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that all boxes are lifted in the minimum number of steps, with a maximum of 3 steps. We need to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the boxes and lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently assigning the heaviest boxes to the strongest lifters or combination of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign boxes to lifters**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest remaining boxes to the available lifters. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat for each step**: Continue this process for each step until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the total number of steps does not exceed 3.\n\n4. **Output the result**: Format the output as specified, showing which lifters are lifting which boxes in each step.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [16, 56, 15, 82, 85, 12, 12, 32]\nlifters = [63, 48, 72, 68]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nused_boxes = [False] * len(boxes)\n\nfor step in range(3):\n    step_lift = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        if used_boxes[i]:\n            continue\n        \n        # Try to find a single lifter or a combination of lifters to lift the box\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if used_lifters[j]:\n                continue\n            if lifter >= box:\n                # Single lifter can lift the box\n                step_lift.append((box, [j]))\n                used_boxes[i] = True\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to find a combination of lifters\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        # Two lifters can lift the box\n                        step_lift.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_boxes[i] = True\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        break\n                if used_boxes[i]:\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step_lift)\n    if all(used_boxes):\n        break\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that all boxes are lifted in 3 or fewer steps."
