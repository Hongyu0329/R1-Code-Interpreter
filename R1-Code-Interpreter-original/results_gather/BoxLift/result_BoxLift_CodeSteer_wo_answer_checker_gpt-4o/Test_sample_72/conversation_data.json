    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try and match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible. Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it. Once a box is lifted, move to the next heaviest box.\n\n3. **Use Combinations of Lifters**: If a single lifter cannot lift a box, try combinations of lifters. Use a greedy approach to combine the strongest available lifters to lift the heaviest possible box.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, keeping track of the steps.\n\n5. **Ensure Steps Are Within Limit**: Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [280, 109, 195, 129, 54, 216, 157, 193, 44, 233, 171, 218, 204, 120, 131, 151]\nlifters = [49, 131, 66, 124, 91]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    available_lifters = lifters[:]\n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        # Try to find a combination of lifters that can lift the box\n        for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n            for combo in combinations(enumerate(available_lifters), r):\n                indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n                if sum(capacities) >= box:\n                    step.append((box, list(indices)))\n                    for index in sorted(indices, reverse=True):\n                        del available_lifters[index]\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n            else:\n                continue\n            break\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 8.",

This approach will help us find the optimal assignment of lifters to boxes while minimizing the number of steps. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Backtracking with Memoization**: Use a recursive function to try different combinations of lifters for each box. Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n2. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in the current step to ensure each lifter is used only once per step.\n\n3. **Minimize Steps**: Try to lift as many boxes as possible in each step and keep track of the minimum number of steps required.\n\n4. **Ensure Step Limit**: Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 8.\n\nLet's implement this refined approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nboxes = [280, 109, 195, 129, 54, 216, 157, 193, 44, 233, 171, 218, 204, 120, 131, 151]\nlifters = [49, 131, 66, 124, 91]\n\n# Sort boxes in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Memoization dictionary\nmemo = {}\n\ndef can_lift(box, available_lifters):\n    for r in range(1, len(available_lifters) + 1):\n        for combo in combinations(enumerate(available_lifters), r):\n            indices, capacities = zip(*combo)\n            if sum(capacities) >= box:\n                return list(indices)\n    return None\n\ndef backtrack(remaining_boxes, available_lifters, step_count):\n    if not remaining_boxes:\n        return step_count\n\n    if step_count > 8:\n        return float('inf')\n\n    state = (tuple(remaining_boxes), tuple(available_lifters))\n    if state in memo:\n        return memo[state]\n\n    min_steps = float('inf')\n    for i, box in enumerate(remaining_boxes):\n        lifter_indices = can_lift(box, available_lifters)\n        if lifter_indices is not None:\n            new_lifters = [l for j, l in enumerate(available_lifters) if j not in lifter_indices]\n            new_boxes = remaining_boxes[:i] + remaining_boxes[i+1:]\n            steps = backtrack(new_boxes, new_lifters, step_count + 1)\n            min_steps = min(min_steps, steps)\n\n    memo[state] = min_steps\n    return min_steps\n\n# Start backtracking\nmin_steps = backtrack(boxes, lifters, 0)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Minimum steps required: {min_steps}\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach with memoization to efficiently find the minimum number of steps required to lift all the boxes.
