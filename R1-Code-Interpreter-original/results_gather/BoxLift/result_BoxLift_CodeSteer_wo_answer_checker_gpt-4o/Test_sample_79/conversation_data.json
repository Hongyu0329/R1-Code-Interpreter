Multiple boxes can be lifted in each step.\n2. Each lifter can only lift one box at a time.\n3. Each lifting agent can be used only once in each step.\n4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try and lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible. Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it. Use a greedy approach to combine lifters with the largest capacities first.\n\n3. **Repeat for Each Step**: Once a box is lifted, remove it from the list and move to the next heaviest box. Repeat this process until all boxes are lifted.\n\n4. **Limit Steps to 6**: Ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n    steps = []\n    \n    while boxes:\n        step = []\n        remaining_lifters = lifters[:]\n        \n        for box in boxes[:]:\n            used_lifters = []\n            total_capacity = 0\n            \n            for i, lifter in enumerate(remaining_lifters):\n                if total_capacity < box:\n                    used_lifters.append(i)\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n            \n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                step.append((box, used_lifters))\n                boxes.remove(box)\n                for i in sorted(used_lifters, reverse=True):\n                    del remaining_lifters[i]\n        \n        steps.append(step)\n        if len(steps) > 6:\n            break\n    \n    return steps\n\nboxes = [368, 220, 131, 287, 153, 175, 153, 217, 262, 115, 365, 394, 291, 222, 142, 126, 189, 82, 159, 367, 356, 168, 188, 355]\nlifters = [200, 91, 128, 198, 196, 119, 188]\n\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 6.",
    "To improve the solution, we can use a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters for each box. This approach will allow us to find a more optimal solution by trying different combinations and backtracking when a combination doesn't lead to a valid solution. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Recursive Backtracking**: Use a recursive function to try different combinations of lifters for each box. If a combination of lifters can lift a box, proceed to the next box. If not, backtrack and try a different combination.\n\n2. **Track Steps**: Keep track of the steps and ensure that the total number of steps does not exceed 6.\n\n3. **Prune Inefficient Paths**: If at any point the number of steps exceeds 6, backtrack immediately.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef can_lift(box, lifters, used):\n    total_capacity = 0\n    indices = []\n    for i, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not used[i] and total_capacity < box:\n            total_capacity += lifter\n            indices.append(i)\n    return total_capacity >= box, indices\n\ndef backtrack(boxes, lifters, step, steps, used):\n    if step >= 6:\n        return False\n    if not boxes:\n        return True\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        can_lift_box, indices = can_lift(box, lifters, used)\n        if can_lift_box:\n            for index in indices:\n                used[index] = True\n            steps[step].append((box, indices))\n            if backtrack(boxes[:i] + boxes[i+1:], lifters, step + 1, steps, used):\n                return True\n            steps[step].pop()\n            for index in indices:\n                used[index] = False\n    \n    return False\n\ndef assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters):\n    boxes.sort(reverse=True)\n    lifters.sort(reverse=True)\n    steps = [[] for _ in range(6)]\n    used = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    if backtrack(boxes, lifters, 0, steps, used):\n        return steps\n    else:\n        return []\n\nboxes = [368, 220, 131, 287, 153, 175, 153, 217, 262, 115, 365, 394, 291, 222, 142, 126, 189, 82, 159, 367, 356, 168, 188, 355]\nlifters = [200, 91, 128, 198, 196, 119, 188]\n\nsteps = assign_lifters_to_boxes(boxes, lifters)\n\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    if step:\n        output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore different combinations of lifters for each box, ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraint of using no more than 6 steps.",
    "Let's refine the backtracking approach to ensure it correctly tracks the state of used lifters and steps. We'll also incorporate memoization to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency. Here's the updated plan:\n\n1. **Recursive Backtracking with Memoization**: Use a recursive function to try different combinations of lifters for each box.
