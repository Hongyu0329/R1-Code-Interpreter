    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the boxes in descending order of weight. This way, we can try to lift the heaviest boxes first, which are more challenging to lift.\n2. Sort the lifters in descending order of their capacities. This allows us to use the strongest lifters first, which is efficient for lifting heavier boxes.\n3. For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters if necessary.\n4. Keep track of which lifters are used in each step and ensure they are not reused within the same step.\n5.
