    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This will help us to try and match the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters first.\n\n2. **Initialize Steps**: Create a list to store the steps, where each step is a list of tuples representing the boxes and the lifters assigned to them.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign lifters to the heaviest boxes first. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine multiple lifters to lift it. Ensure that each lifter is only used once per step.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [142, 109, 62, 158, 37, 50, 180, 128, 61, 123, 44, 51]\nlifters = [93, 71, 82, 91]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        total_capacity = 0\n        lifter_indices = []\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and total_capacity + lifter >= box:\n                total_capacity += lifter\n                lifter_indices.append(j)\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                if total_capacity >= box:\n                    break\n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the minimum number of steps, ensuring that all constraints are met.",
    "To optimize the solution, we can use a greedy approach to assign lifters to boxes. The idea is to always try to lift the heaviest box possible in each step by combining the available lifters in the most efficient way. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Sort the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Steps**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by combining lifters.\n\n3. **Use a Greedy Strategy**: For each box, try to use the fewest number of lifters with the highest capacities to lift it. This ensures that we maximize the use of each lifter's capacity.\n\n4. **Track Used Lifters**: Keep track of which lifters have been used in the current step to ensure each lifter is only used once per step.\n\n5. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted.\n\nLet's implement this optimized approach:\n\n```python\nboxes = [142, 109, 62, 158, 37, 50, 180, 128, 61, 123, 44, 51]\nlifters = [93, 71, 82, 91]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    remaining_capacity = lifters[:]\n    \n    for box in boxes[:]:\n        lifter_indices = []\n        total_capacity = 0\n        \n        for i, capacity in enumerate(remaining_capacity):\n            if not used_lifters[i] and total_capacity + capacity <= box:\n                total_capacity += capacity\n                lifter_indices.append(i)\n                used_lifters[i] = True\n                if total_capacity >= box:\n                    break\n        \n        if total_capacity >= box:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n            for idx in lifter_indices:\n                remaining_capacity[idx] = 0  # Mark these lifters as used for this step\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a greedy strategy to efficiently assign lifters to boxes, ensuring that the heaviest boxes are lifted first with the fewest number of lifters. This should reduce the number of steps and handle the task within the constraints.",
    "To address the inefficiencies and optimize the solution further, we can use a backtracking approach with memoization. This approach will explore different combinations of lifters for each box and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n\n2. **Backtracking with Memoization**: Use a recursive function to try different combinations of lifters for each box. Use a memoization dictionary to store already computed results for specific states to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Track Used Lifters**: Ensure that each lifter is only used once per step by keeping track of used lifters.\n\n4. **Base Case and Recursive Case**: The base case is when all boxes are lifted. The recursive case involves trying to lift the current box with available lifters and then moving to the next box.\n\n5. **Output the Steps**: Once all boxes are lifted, format the output as specified.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nboxes = [142, 109, 62, 158, 37, 50, 180, 128, 61, 123, 44, 51]\nlifters = [93, 71, 82, 91]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Memoization cache\n@lru_cache(None)\ndef can_lift(box_index, used_lifters):\n    if box_index == len(boxes):\n        return True, []\n\n    box = boxes[box_index]\n    lifter_indices = []\n    total_capacity = 0\n\n    for i, capacity in enumerate(lifters):\n        if not (used_lifters & (1 << i)) and total_capacity + capacity <= box:\n            total_capacity += capacity\n            lifter_indices.append(i)\n            if total_capacity >= box:\n                break\n\n    if total_capacity >= box:\n        new_used_lifters = used_lifters\n        for idx in lifter_indices:\n            new_used_lifters |= (1 << idx)\n        can_lift_next, next_steps = can_lift(box_index + 1, new_used_lifters)\n        if can_lift_next:\n            return True, [(box, lifter_indices)] + next_steps\n\n    return False, []\n\nsteps = []\nused_lifters = 0\nfor step in range(5):\n    can_lift_all, step_result = can_lift(0, used_lifters)\n    if can_lift_all:\n        steps.append(step_result)\n        break\n    else:\n        steps.append(step_result)\n        for _, lifter_indices in step_result:\n            for idx in lifter_indices:\n                used_lifters |= (1 << idx)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach with memoization to efficiently explore possible combinations of lifters for each box. The `can_lift` function recursively checks if the current box can be lifted with the available lifters and uses memoization to store results for specific states. This should reduce the number of redundant calculations and handle the task within the constraints.",
    "Let's refine the approach by ensuring that the backtracking logic correctly tracks and updates the state of used lifters. We'll also ensure that the recursive function correctly handles the base and recursive cases.

Use a bitmask to track which lifters have been used in the current step.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If all boxes are lifted, return the current step configuration.\n\n4. **Recursive Case**: For each box, try to lift it using a combination of available lifters.
