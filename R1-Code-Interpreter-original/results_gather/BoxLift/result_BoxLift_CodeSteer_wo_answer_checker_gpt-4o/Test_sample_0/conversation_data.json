    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Initialize Steps**: Create a list to store the steps, where each step is a list of tuples representing the boxes and the lifters assigned to them.\n\n3. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available boxes to the available lifters. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n4. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue assigning lifters to boxes in steps until all boxes are lifted.\n\n5. **Ensure Steps Are Within Limit**: Make sure the total number of steps does not exceed 5.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [18, 93, 23, 70, 72, 22, 96, 96]\nlifters = [60, 46, 61]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                boxes[i] = None\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters if a single lifter can't lift the box\n            total_capacity = 0\n            lifter_indices = []\n            for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n                if not used_lifters[j]:\n                    total_capacity += lifter\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                        boxes[i] = None\n                        break\n    \n    # Remove lifted boxes\n    boxes = [box for box in boxes if box is not None]\n    steps.append(step)\n    if len(steps) > 5:\n        break\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = \"<<<\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\\n\"\noutput += \">>>\"\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 5.",
    "To address the problem of exceeding the allowed number of steps, we need to optimize the assignment of lifters to boxes. A more strategic approach is required to ensure that we lift the heaviest boxes first and combine lifters effectively. Here's a refined plan:\n\n1. **Sort Boxes and Lifters**: Sort the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity.\n\n2. **Use a Greedy Approach**: In each step, try to lift the heaviest boxes first by combining lifters if necessary.
