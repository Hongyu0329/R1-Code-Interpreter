  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:TYHKXRZWCDIFD\n\nRound 1: Add a Y card and remove a I card.\nRound 2: Add a K card and remove a D card.\nRound 3: Add a I card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each round step by step, following the rules provided.\n\n**Initial Cards:**\nTYHKXRZWCDIFD\n\n**Round 1:**\n- **Add a Y card:** The cards become TYHKXRZWCDIFDY.\n- **Remove an I card:** The cards become TYHKXRZWCFDY.\n- **Check for \"Peng\":** We have two Y cards in hand, and the newly added card is also Y. Therefore, this satisfies the \"Peng\" condition.\n- **Result for Round 1:** \"Peng\" (1)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- **Add a K card:** The cards become TYHKXRZWCFDYK.\n- **Remove a D card:** The cards become TYHKXRZWCFYK.\n- **Check for \"Peng\":** There are two K cards in hand, and the newly added card is K. This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition.\n- **Result for Round 2:** \"Peng\" (1)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- **Add an I card:** The cards become TYHKXRZWCFYKI.\n- **Check for \"Peng\":** There are no three identical cards.\n- **Check for \"Chi\":** We need to check if there are any two cards in hand that, with the new card, form a consecutive sequence.\n  - Possible sequences with I: HIJ, IJK, etc.\n  - Check for HIJ: H and I are present, but J is not.\n  - Check for IJK: I and K are present, but J is not.\n  - No consecutive sequence can be formed with the new card I.\n- **Result for Round 3:** \"Pass\" (0)\n\nSince the result of the final round is what we need to determine, the answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
