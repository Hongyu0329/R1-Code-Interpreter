    "To determine the result of the final round, we need to analyze the sequence of events and apply the game rules step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Initial cards: YQILCUCZEAXNK\n   - We have 13 cards initially.\n\n2. **Round 1:**\n   - Add a H card: YQILCUCZEAXNKH\n   - Remove an E card: YQILCUCZAXNKH\n   - Check for \"Peng\":\n     - We need to find two identical cards in hand and check if the newly added card (H) is the same as these two cards.\n     - The cards in hand are: Y, Q, I, L, C, U, C, Z, A, X, N, K, H\n     - There are no two identical H cards in hand, so the result is \"Pass\" (0).\n\n3. **Round 2:**\n   - Add a C card: YQILCUCZAXNKHC\n   - No card is removed in this round as per the given information.\n   - Check for \"Peng\":\n     - We need to find two identical cards in hand and check if the newly added card (C) is the same as these two cards.\n     - The cards in hand are: Y, Q, I, L, C, U, C, Z, A, X, N, K, H, C\n     - We have two C cards in hand (C, C), and the newly added card is also C.\n     - This satisfies the condition for \"Peng,\" so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\nTherefore, the number judged in the final round is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>"
