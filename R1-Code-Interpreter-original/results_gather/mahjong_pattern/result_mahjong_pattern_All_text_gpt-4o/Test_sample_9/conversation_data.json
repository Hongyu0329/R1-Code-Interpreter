  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each round step by step, following the rules provided.\n\n**Initial Cards:**\n- T, S, H, D, B, F, G, L, N, A, K, W, M\n\n**Round 1:**\n- Add a H card and remove a T card.\n- New set of cards: S, H, H, D, B, F, G, L, N, A, K, W, M\n- Check for \"Peng\": We have two H cards in hand, and the newly added card is also H. This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition.\n- Result for Round 1: \"Peng\" (1)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- Add an I card and remove an S card.\n- New set of cards: H, H, D, B, F, G, L, N, A, K, W, M, I\n- Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n- Check for \"Chi\": Look for any consecutive sequences including the new card I.\n  - Possible sequences: DEF, EFG, FGH, GHI, HIJ, IJK, JKL, KLM, LMN, MNO, NOP, OPQ, PQR, QRS, RST, STU, TUV, UVW, VWX, WXY, XYZ\n  - GHI is a valid sequence with G, H, and I.\n- Result for Round 2: \"Chi\" (2)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- Add a H card.\n- New set of cards: H, H, D, B, F, G, L, N, A, K, W, M, I, H\n- Check for \"Peng\": We have two H cards in hand, and the newly added card is also H. This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition.\n- Result for Round 3: \"Peng\" (1)\n\nSince \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi,\" the result for the final round is \"Peng.\"\n\nFinal Answer: <<<1>>>"
