  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:RNMKZVUXGWFZD\n\nRound 1: Add a B card and remove a K card.\nRound 2: Add a W card and remove a U card.\nRound 3: Add a Y card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules provided.\n\n**Initial Cards:**\nRNMKZVUXGWFZD\n\n**Round 1:**\n- **Add a B card:** The cards become RNMBZVUXGWFZD.\n- **Remove a K card:** The cards become RNMBZVUXGWFZD (K is removed).\n- **Check for \"Peng\":** No three identical cards.\n- **Check for \"Chi\":** Look for any consecutive sequences with the new card B.\n  - Possible sequences: AB, BC, etc.\n  - Check: No sequence with B forms a consecutive sequence with any two other cards.\n- **Result:** Pass (0).\n\n**Round 2:**\n- **Add a W card:** The cards become RNMBZVWXGWFZD.\n- **Remove a U card:** The cards become RNMBZVWXGWFZD (U is removed).\n- **Check for \"Peng\":** No three identical cards.\n- **Check for \"Chi\":** Look for any consecutive sequences with the new card W.\n  - Possible sequences: VWX, WXY, etc.\n  - Check: VWX is a valid sequence (V, W, X).\n- **Result:** Chi (2).\n\n**Round 3:**\n- **Add a Y card:** The cards become RNMBZVWXGYFZD.\n- **Check for \"Peng\":** No three identical cards.\n- **Check for \"Chi\":** Look for any consecutive sequences with the new card Y.\n  - Possible sequences: XYZ, WXY, etc.\n  - Check: WXY is a valid sequence (W, X, Y).\n- **Result:** Chi (2).\n\nSince the result of the final round is determined by the last addition, the final result is Chi.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
