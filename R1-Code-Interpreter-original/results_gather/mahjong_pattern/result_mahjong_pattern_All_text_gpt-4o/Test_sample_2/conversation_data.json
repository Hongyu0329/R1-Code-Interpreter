Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If the newly added card does not meet the condition in rule 3, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n5.

    "To determine the result of the final round, we need to follow the rules of the game step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start with the initial set of cards: P, F, V, Y, B, J, B, N, L, Y, U, C, T.\n\n2. **Round 1: Add a T card:**\n   - The new card added is T.\n   - After adding the T card, the cards in hand are: P, F, V, Y, B, J, B, N, L, Y, U, C, T, T.\n\n3. **Check for \"Peng\" Condition:**\n   - We need to check if there are two identical cards in hand and if the newly added card (T) is the same as these two cards.\n   - In the current hand, we have two T cards (the original T and the newly added T).\n   - However, there are not two identical T cards in the original set before adding the new T card. Therefore, the condition for \"Peng\" is not met.\n\n4. **Determine the Result:**\n   - Since the condition for \"Peng\" is not met, the result for this round is \"Pass.\"\n\n5. **Final Result:**\n   - The result for the final round is \"Pass,\" which is represented by the number 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<0>>>"
