    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules provided.\n\n**Initial Cards:**\nUGPLEQMWQZRCA\n\n**Round 1:**\n- Add a Q card.\n- Remove a C card.\n- New hand: UGGLEQMWQZRQA\n- Check for \"Peng\": There are two Qs in hand, and the new card is Q. So, \"Peng\" is possible.\n- Result: 1 (Peng)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- Add an R card.\n- Remove a P card.\n- New hand: UGGLEQMWQZRRA\n- Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n- Check for \"Chi\": Look for consecutive sequences with R. Possible sequences: QRS, but Q is not consecutive with R in the hand.\n- Result: 0 (Pass)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- Add a Q card.\n- Remove an A card.\n- New hand: UGGLEQMWQZRQ\n- Check for \"Peng\": There are two Qs in hand, and the new card is Q. So, \"Peng\" is possible.\n- Result: 1 (Peng)\n\n**Round 4:**\n- Add an R card.\n- Remove a Q card.\n- New hand: UGGLEQMWZRQR\n- Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n- Check for \"Chi\": Look for consecutive sequences with R. Possible sequences: QRS, but S is not in the hand.\n- Result: 0 (Pass)\n\n**Round 5:**\n- Add an S card.\n- New hand: UGGLEQMWZRQRS\n- Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n- Check for \"Chi\": Look for consecutive sequences with S. Possible sequences: QRS, which is present in the hand.\n- Result: 2 (Chi)\n\nSince \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi,\" we only consider \"Chi\" if \"Peng\" is not possible. In the final round, \"Chi\" is possible, and \"Peng\" is not.\n\nTherefore, the number judged in the final round is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>"
