    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the game rules step by step and determine the result for each round. Let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: NNTMOFBJDEGAO\n   - We have 13 cards initially.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - **Add a N card**: The cards now are NNTMOFBJDEGAON.\n   - **Remove a T card**: The cards now are NNNMOFBJDEGAO.\n   - **Check for \"Peng\"**: We need to see if there are two identical cards and the newly added card is the same as these two cards.\n     - We have three N cards (NNN), and the newly added card is N.\n     - This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition (two identical cards and the newly added card is the same).\n   - **Result for Round 1**: \"Peng\" (1).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - **Add an O card**: The cards now are NNNMOFBJDEGAOO.\n   - **No card is removed in this round**.\n   - **Check for \"Peng\"**: We need to see if there are two identical cards and the newly added card is the same as these two cards.\n     - We have two O cards (OO), and the newly added card is O.\n     - This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition (two identical cards and the newly added card is the same).\n   - **Result for Round 2**: \"Peng\" (1).\n\nSince we are asked to determine the number judged in the final round, we look at the result of Round 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>"
