    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the game step by step and determine the result for each round.\n\n**Initial Setup:**\n- Initial cards: VQFIUPNXEKOEJ\n\n**Round 1:**\n1. Add an E card to the hand.\n   - New hand: VQFIUPNXEKOEJE\n2. Check for \"Peng\" condition:\n   - We need to find if there are two identical cards in the hand and if the newly added card (E) is the same as these two cards.\n   - Count the occurrences of each card:\n     - V: 1\n     - Q: 1\n     - F: 1\n     - I: 1\n     - U: 1\n     - P: 1\n     - N: 1\n     - X: 1\n     - E: 3\n     - K: 1\n     - O: 1\n     - J: 1\n   - The card E appears 3 times, satisfying the \"Peng\" condition.\n   - Result for Round 1: \"Peng\" (1)\n3. Remove a V card (as per the rule, the removed card does not affect the result).\n   - New hand after removal: QFIUPNXEKOEJE\n\n**Round 2:**\n1. Add a P card to the hand.\n   - New hand: QFIUPNXEKOEJEP\n2. Check for \"Peng\" condition:\n   - We need to find if there are two identical cards in the hand and if the newly added card (P) is the same as these two cards.\n   - Count the occurrences of each card:\n     - Q: 1\n     - F: 1\n     - I: 1\n     - U: 1\n     - P: 2\n     - N: 1\n     - X: 1\n     - E: 3\n     - K: 1\n     - O: 1\n     - J: 1\n   - The card P appears 2 times, but the newly added card P does not make it 3, so it does not satisfy the \"Peng\" condition.\n   - Result for Round 2: \"Pass\" (0)\n\n**Final Result:**\n- The result for the final round (Round 2) is \"Pass.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is <<<0>>>."
