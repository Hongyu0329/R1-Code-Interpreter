  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If the newly added card does not meet the condition in rule 3, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n5. The removed card does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:ASCQPGYIKNVBD\n\nRound 1: Add a I card and remove a D card.\nRound 2: Add a V card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the game rules step by step and determine the result for each round. Let's analyze each round carefully:\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- Initial cards: A, S, C, Q, P, G, Y, I, K, N, V, B, D\n\n### Round 1:\n1. **Add a card**: I\n2. **Remove a card**: D\n3. **Cards in hand after removal**: A, S, C, Q, P, G, Y, I, K, N, V, B, I\n4. **Check for \"Peng\"**:\n   - We need to check if there are two identical cards in hand and if the newly added card (I) is the same as these two cards.\n   - In the current hand, we have two I's (one from the initial setup and one newly added).\n   - Since there are two I's and the newly added card is also I, the condition for \"Peng\" is satisfied.\n5. **Result for Round 1**: \"Peng\" (1)\n\n### Round 2:\n1. **Add a card**: V\n2. **No card is removed in this round** (as per the problem statement, removal is only mentioned in Round 1)\n3. **Cards in hand**: A, S, C, Q, P, G, Y, I, K, N, V, B, I, V\n4. **Check for \"Peng\"**:\n   - We need to check if there are two identical cards in hand and if the newly added card (V) is the same as these two cards.\n   - In the current hand, we have two V's (one from the initial setup and one newly added).\n   - Since there are two V's and the newly added card is also V, the condition for \"Peng\" is satisfied.\n5. **Result for Round 2**: \"Peng\" (1)\n\n### Final Determination:\n- The result for the final round (Round 2) is \"Peng\" (1).\n\nTherefore, the number judged in the final round is represented as:\n\n<<<1>>>"
