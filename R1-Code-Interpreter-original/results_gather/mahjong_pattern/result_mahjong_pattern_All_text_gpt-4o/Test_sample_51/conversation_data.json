  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:SVXIZTPFAVQDY\n\nRound 1: Add a [ card and remove a F card.\nRound 2: Add a V card and remove a A card.\nRound 3: Add a V card and remove a Z card.\nRound 4: Add a U card and remove a V card.\nRound 5: Add a R card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each round step by step, following the rules provided. Let's go through each round:\n\n**Initial Cards:** SVXIZTPFAVQDY\n\n**Round 1:**\n- **Add a [ card:** The cards become SVXIZTPA[V]QDY[\n- **Remove a F card:** The cards become SVXIZTPA[V]QDY[\n- **Check for Peng:** No three identical cards.\n- **Check for Chi:** No consecutive sequence with the new card [.\n- **Result:** Pass (0)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- **Add a V card:** The cards become SVXIZTPA[V]QDY[V]\n- **Remove a A card:** The cards become SVXIZTP[V]QDY[V]\n- **Check for Peng:** There are three V cards (V, V, V).\n- **Result:** Peng (1)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- **Add a V card:** The cards become SVXIZTP[V]QDY[V]V\n- **Remove a Z card:** The cards become SVXITP[V]QDY[V]V\n- **Check for Peng:** There are three V cards (V, V, V).\n- **Result:** Peng (1)\n\n**Round 4:**\n- **Add a U card:** The cards become SVXITP[V]QDY[V]VU\n- **Remove a V card:** The cards become SVXITP[V]QDY[V]U\n- **Check for Peng:** No three identical cards.\n- **Check for Chi:** Check for consecutive sequence with U:\n  - TUV is a consecutive sequence.\n- **Result:** Chi (2)\n\n**Round 5:**\n- **Add a R card:** The cards become SVXITP[V]QDY[V]UR\n- **Check for Peng:** No three identical cards.\n- **Check for Chi:** Check for consecutive sequence with R:\n  - QRS is a consecutive sequence.\n- **Result:** Chi (2)\n\nIn the final round, the result is determined as Chi (2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<2>>>"
