  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:IKPCINBJEUUMF\n\nRound 1: Add a I card and remove a U card.\nRound 2: Add a I card and remove a P card.\nRound 3: Add a I card and remove a I card.\nRound 4: Add a M card and remove a N card.\nRound 5: Add a N card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each round step by step, considering the rules provided.\n\n**Initial Cards:**\nIKPCINBJEUUMF\n\n**Round 1:**\n- Add a card: I\n- Remove a card: U\n- New hand: IKPCINBJEUUMFI (after adding I and before removing U)\n- After removing U: IKPCINBJEUMFI\n- Check for \"Peng\": There are two I's in the hand, and the new card is I, so we have three I's. This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition.\n- Result: Peng (1)\n\n**Round 2:**\n- Add a card: I\n- Remove a card: P\n- New hand: IKPCINBJEUMFII (after adding I and before removing P)\n- After removing P: IKCINBJEUMFII\n- Check for \"Peng\": There are two I's in the hand, and the new card is I, so we have three I's. This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition.\n- Result: Peng (1)\n\n**Round 3:**\n- Add a card: I\n- Remove a card: I\n- New hand: IKCINBJEUMFIII (after adding I and before removing I)\n- After removing I: KCINBJEUMFIII\n- Check for \"Peng\": There are two I's in the hand, and the new card is I, so we have three I's. This satisfies the \"Peng\" condition.\n- Result: Peng (1)\n\n**Round 4:**\n- Add a card: M\n- Remove a card: N\n- New hand: KCINBJEUMFIIIM (after adding M and before removing N)\n- After removing N: KCIBJEUMFIIIM\n- Check for \"Peng\": There are no three identical cards.\n- Check for \"Chi\": Look for consecutive sequences with the new card M. Possible sequences: JKL, KLM, LMN, MNO, etc. The sequence KLM is present (K, L, M).\n- Result: Chi (2)\n\n**Round 5:**\n- Add a card: N\n- No card is removed in this round.\n- New hand: KCIBJEUMFIIIMN\n- Check for \"Peng\": There are no three identical cards.\n- Check for \"Chi\": Look for consecutive sequences with the new card N. Possible sequences: LMN, MNO, etc. The sequence LMN is present (L, M, N).\n- Result: Chi (2)\n\nSince \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi,\" and there is no \"Peng\" in the final round, the result is determined by the \"Chi\" condition.\n\nFinal answer: <<<2>>>"
