    "To determine the result of the final round, we need to follow the game rules step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: We start with the cards JHUFWIXNAPYRX. This is a total of 13 cards.\n\n2. **Round 1**: A new card 'A' is added to the hand. The hand now becomes JHUFWIXNAPYRXA.\n\n3. **Check for \"Peng\"**: \n   - We need to check if there are two identical cards in the hand and if the newly added card 'A' matches these two cards.\n   - In the initial hand JHUFWIXNAPYRX, the card 'A' appears once.\n   - After adding the new card 'A', the hand becomes JHUFWIXNAPYRXA, where 'A' appears twice.\n   - Since there are not two identical 'A' cards in the initial hand, the condition for \"Peng\" is not met.\n\n4. **Determine the Result**:\n   - Since the condition for \"Peng\" is not satisfied, the result for this round is \"Pass.\"\n\n5. **Final Result**: According to the rules, a \"Pass\" is represented by the number 0.\n\nTherefore, the number judged in the final round is 0.\n\nThe answer is: <<<0>>>"
