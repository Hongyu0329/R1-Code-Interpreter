    "To determine the result of the final round, we need to follow the game rules step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: We start with the cards \"ISZTWVHUUXWKC\". There are 13 cards in total.\n\n2. **Round 1**: A new card \"P\" is added to the hand. The hand now contains \"ISZTWVHUUXWKCP\".\n\n3. **Check for \"Peng\"**: According to rule 3, we need to check if there are two identical cards in the hand and if the newly added card \"P\" matches these two identical cards. \n\n   - Let's list the cards in the hand: I, S, Z, T, W, V, H, U, U, X, W, K, C, P.\n   - The pairs of identical cards in the hand are: U, U and W, W.\n   - The newly added card is \"P\". We need to check if \"P\" matches any of the pairs:\n     - \"P\" does not match \"U\".\n     - \"P\" does not match \"W\".\n\n4. **Determine the Result**: Since the newly added card \"P\" does not match any of the pairs of identical cards, the result is determined as \"Pass\" according to rule 4.\n\n5. **Final Result**: The result for this round is \"Pass\", represented by the number 0.\n\nTherefore, the number judged in the final round is 0.\n\nThe answer is: <<<0>>>"
