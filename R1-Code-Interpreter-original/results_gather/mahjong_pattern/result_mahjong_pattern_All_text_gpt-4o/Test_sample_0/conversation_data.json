    "To determine the result of the final round, we need to follow the game rules step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 13 cards: Q, P, D, L, J, Y, C, R, X, B, S, H, N.\n\n2. **Round 1**: A new card, Y, is added to the hand.\n\n3. **Check for \"Peng\"**:\n   - According to rule 3, a \"Peng\" occurs if there are two identical cards in hand and the newly added card is the same as these two cards.\n   - Before adding the new card, we have one Y in the initial set of cards.\n   - After adding the new Y card, we now have two Y cards in hand.\n   - However, for a \"Peng\" to occur, we need to have two identical cards already in hand before adding the new card, and the new card must be the same as these two cards.\n   - In this case, we only had one Y before adding the new Y, so the condition for \"Peng\" is not met.\n\n4. **Determine the Result**:\n   - Since the condition for \"Peng\" is not met, the result is determined as \"Pass\" according to rule 4.\n\n5. **Final Result**: The result of the final round is \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <<<0>>>."
