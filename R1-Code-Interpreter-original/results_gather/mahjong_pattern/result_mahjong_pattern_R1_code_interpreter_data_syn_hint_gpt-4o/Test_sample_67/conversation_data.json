  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:ZOBGXSKIACZLV\n\nRound 1: Add a D card and remove a Z card.\nRound 2: Add a W card and remove a Z card.\nRound 3: Add a D card and remove a A card.\nRound 4: Add a G card and remove a S card.\nRound 5: Add a D card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the card game and apply the rules to determine the result of each round. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `ZOBGXSKIACZLV`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `D` card: `ZOBGXSKIACZLVD`.\n   - Remove a `Z` card: `OBGXSKIACZLVD`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `D`.\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a `W` card: `OBGXSKIACZLVDW`.\n   - Remove a `Z` card: `OBGXSKIACLVWD`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `W`.\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `D` card: `OBGXSKIACLVWDD`.\n   - Remove an `A` card: `OBGXSKICLVWDD`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": Two `D` cards in hand, and a new `D` card is added.\n   - Result: \"Peng\" (1).\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add a `G` card: `OBGXSKICLVWDDG`.\n   - Remove an `S` card: `OBGXKICLVWDDG`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `G`.\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add a `D` card: `OBGXKICLVWDDGD`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": Two `D` cards in hand, and a new `D` card is added.\n   - Result: \"Peng\" (1).\n\nThe final result in Round 5 is \"Peng\" (1). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
