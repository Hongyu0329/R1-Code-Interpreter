  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:SVXIZTPFAVQDY\n\nRound 1: Add a [ card and remove a F card.\nRound 2: Add a V card and remove a A card.\nRound 3: Add a V card and remove a Z card.\nRound 4: Add a U card and remove a V card.\nRound 5: Add a R card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the card game based on the given rules and determine the result for each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `SVXIZTPFAVQDY`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `[` card.\n   - Remove an `F` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a `V` card.\n   - Remove an `A` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `V` card.\n   - Remove a `Z` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add a `U` card.\n   - Remove a `V` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add an `R` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\nFor each round, we need to check if the newly added card forms a \"Peng\" or \"Chi\" with the existing cards. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi\".\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result for each round:\n\n```python\ndef check_peng_or_chi(cards, new_card):\n    # Check for Peng\n    if cards.count(new_card) >= 2:\n        return 1  # Peng\n    \n    # Check for Chi\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return 2  # Chi\n    \n    return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"SVXIZTPFAVQDY\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.append('[')\ncards.remove('F')\nresult_round_1 = check_peng_or_chi(cards, '[')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.append('V')\ncards.remove('A')\nresult_round_2 = check_peng_or_chi(cards, 'V')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.append('V')\ncards.remove('Z')\nresult_round_3 = check_peng_or_chi(cards, 'V')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.append('U')\ncards.remove('V')\nresult_round_4 = check_peng_or_chi(cards, 'U')\n\n# Round 5\ncards.append('R')\nresult_round_5 = check_peng_or_chi(cards, 'R')\n\n# Output the result of the final round\nprint(result_round_5)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the final round.",
