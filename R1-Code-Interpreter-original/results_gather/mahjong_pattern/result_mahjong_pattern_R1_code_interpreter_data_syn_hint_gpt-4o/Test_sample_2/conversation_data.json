Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If the newly added card does not meet the condition in rule 3, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n5.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the game and determine the result for the given round.\n\n1. We start with the initial set of cards: PFVYBJBNLYUCT.\n2. In Round 1, a T card is added to the hand.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n- The initial cards are: PFVYBJBNLYUCT\n- We add a T card, so the cards become: PFVYBJBNLYUCTT\n\nNow, we need to check if there are two identical cards in the hand and if the newly added card (T) is the same as these two cards.\n\n- In the hand PFVYBJBNLYUCTT, we have two T cards (the last two cards).\n- The newly added card is also T.\n\nSince there are two identical T cards in the hand and the newly added card is also T, the condition for \"Peng\" is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the result for this round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
