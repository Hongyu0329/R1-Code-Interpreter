  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If the newly added card does not meet the condition in rule 3, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n5. The removed card does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:NNTMOFBJDEGAO\n\nRound 1: Add a N card and remove a T card.\nRound 2: Add a O card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the game and determine the result for each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: We start with the cards \"NNTMOFBJDEGAO\".\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - **Add a N card**: The cards become \"NNNTMOFBJDEGAO\".\n   - **Remove a T card**: The cards become \"NNNMOFBJDEGAO\".\n   - **Check for Peng**: We have three 'N' cards, so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - **Add an O card**: The cards become \"NNNMOFBJDEGAOO\".\n   - **Check for Peng**: We have three 'O' cards, so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\nSince the result of the final round is determined by the last addition, we need to check the condition after the second round. In this case, the condition for \"Peng\" is met in both rounds.\n\nTherefore, the number judged in the final round is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
