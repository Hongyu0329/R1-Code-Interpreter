  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:XQFTKUZIXJGBD\n\nRound 1: Add a L card and remove a Z card.\nRound 2: Add a D card and remove a F card.\nRound 3: Add a W card and remove a K card.\nRound 4: Add a X card and remove a L card.\nRound 5: Add a I card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the card game and apply the rules to determine the result for each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `XQFTKUZIXJGBD`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add `L` and remove `Z`.\n   - New set of cards: `XQFTKULIXJGBD`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `L`.\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add `D` and remove `F`.\n   - New set of cards: `XQDTKULIXJGBD`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `D`.\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add `W` and remove `K`.\n   - New set of cards: `XQDTWULIXJGBD`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `W`.\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add `X` and remove `L`.\n   - New set of cards: `XQDTWUIXJGBDX`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": Three `X` cards.\n   - Result: \"Peng\" (1).\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add `I`.\n   - New set of cards: `XQDTWUIXJGBDXI`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `I`.\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\nThe final result for Round 5 is \"Pass\" (0). Let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef determine_result(cards, new_card):\n    # Check for \"Peng\"\n    if cards.count(new_card) >= 2:\n        return 1  # Peng\n\n    # Check for \"Chi\"\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return 2  # Chi\n\n    return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"XQFTKUZIXJGBD\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.remove('Z')\ncards.append('L')\nresult1 = determine_result(cards, 'L')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.remove('F')\ncards.append('D')\nresult2 = determine_result(cards, 'D')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.remove('K')\ncards.append('W')\nresult3 = determine_result(cards, 'W')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.remove('L')\ncards.append('X')\nresult4 = determine_result(cards, 'X')\n\n# Round 5\ncards.append('I')\nresult5 = determine_result(cards, 'I')\n\nprint(result5)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the result for the final round.

    "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7.
