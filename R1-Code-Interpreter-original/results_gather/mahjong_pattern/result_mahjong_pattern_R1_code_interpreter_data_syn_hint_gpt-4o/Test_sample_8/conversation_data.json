    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the card game based on the given rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `TYHKXRZWCDIFD`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `Y` card.\n   - Remove an `I` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - \"Peng\": We need three `Y` cards. After adding `Y`, we have `TYYHKXRZWCDIFD`. There are two `Y` cards, so no \"Peng\".\n     - \"Chi\": Check for any sequence of three consecutive letters. The sequence `XYZ` is present, so this is a \"Chi\".\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a `K` card.\n   - Remove a `D` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - \"Peng\": We need three `K` cards. After adding `K`, we have `TYYHKXKRZWCDIF`. There are two `K` cards, so no \"Peng\".\n     - \"Chi\": Check for any sequence of three consecutive letters. The sequence `XYZ` is still present, so this is a \"Chi\".\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add an `I` card.\n   - No card is removed in this round.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - \"Peng\": We need three `I` cards. After adding `I`, we have `TYYHKXKRZWCDIFI`. There are two `I` cards, so no \"Peng\".\n     - \"Chi\": Check for any sequence of three consecutive letters. The sequence `XYZ` is still present, so this is a \"Chi\".\n\nSince \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi\" and we never have a \"Peng\" situation, we only consider \"Chi\" when applicable. In the final round, the result is \"Chi\", represented by the number 2.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the last round is \"Chi\", represented by the number 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
