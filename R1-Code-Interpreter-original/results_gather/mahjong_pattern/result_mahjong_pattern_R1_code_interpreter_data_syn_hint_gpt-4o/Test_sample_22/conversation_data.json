  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:EGQTSOAEGBQLU\n\nRound 1: Add a Y card and remove a T card.\nRound 2: Add a E card and remove a E card.\nRound 3: Add a Q card and remove a Y card.\nRound 4: Add a G card and remove a Q card.\nRound 5: Add a Q card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the card game based on the given rules and determine the result for each round. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial cards: `EGQTSOAEGBQLU`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `Y` card: `EGQTSOAEGBQLUY`.\n   - Remove a `T` card: `EGQSOAEGBQLUY`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards for \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence for \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add an `E` card: `EGQSOAEGBQLUYE`.\n   - Remove an `E` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUYE`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards for \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence for \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `Q` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUYEQ`.\n   - Remove a `Y` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUEQ`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards for \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence for \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add a `G` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUEQG`.\n   - Remove a `Q` card: `GSOAEGBQLUEQG`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - Three `G` cards for \"Peng\".\n   - Result: \"Peng\" (1).\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add a `Q` card: `GSOAEGBQLUEQGQ`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards for \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence for \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\nThe result for the final round is \"Pass\" (0). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
