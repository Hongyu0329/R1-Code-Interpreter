  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:QNWSHPNZFKSUF\n\nRound 1: Add a F card and remove a N card.\nRound 2: Add a D card and remove a S card.\nRound 3: Add a R card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng, or 2 for Chi.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards while checking the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" in each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial cards: `QNWSHPNZFKSUF`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `F` card.\n   - Remove a `N` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We need three `F` cards. After adding, we have `FF` in hand, so no \"Peng\".\n   - Check for \"Chi\": We need a sequence of three consecutive letters. The cards `F`, `G`, `H` form a sequence, but we don't have `G` and `H` in hand, so no \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a `D` card.\n   - Remove a `S` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": The cards `D`, `E`, `F` form a sequence, but we don't have `E` in hand, so no \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `R` card.\n   - No card is removed in this round.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": The cards `P`, `Q`, `R` form a sequence, and we have all three in hand.\n   - Result: \"Chi\" (2).\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\ndef determine_result(initial_cards, rounds):\n    cards = list(initial_cards)\n    \n    for round_info in rounds:\n        add_card, remove_card = round_info\n        cards.append(add_card)\n        if remove_card:\n            cards.remove(remove_card)\n        \n        # Check for \"Peng\"\n        for card in set(cards):\n            if cards.count(card) >= 3:\n                return 1  # Peng\n        \n        # Check for \"Chi\"\n        sorted_cards = sorted(cards)\n        for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n            if (ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and\n                ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2):\n                return 2  # Chi\n    \n    return 0  # Pass\n\ninitial_cards = \"QNWSHPNZFKSUF\"\nrounds = [('F', 'N'), ('D', 'S'), ('R', None)]\nresult = determine_result(initial_cards, rounds)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the result of the final round.",

    "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n7.
