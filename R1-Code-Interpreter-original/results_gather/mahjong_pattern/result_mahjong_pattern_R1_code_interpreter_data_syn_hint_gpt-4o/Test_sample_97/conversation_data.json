    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the card game according to the rules provided. We will keep track of the cards in hand, add new cards, and remove specified cards in each round. We will then determine the result for each round based on the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi.\"\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial set of cards: \"IVAJUKTRNLQOH\".\n2. For each round, add the new card and remove the specified card.\n3. Check for \"Peng\": If there are two identical cards in hand and the new card is the same as these two cards, the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n4. If \"Peng\" is not applicable, check for \"Chi\": If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is \"Chi\" (2).\n5. If neither \"Peng\" nor \"Chi\" is applicable, the result is \"Pass\" (0).\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result for each round and find the result for the final round.\n\n```python\ndef is_consecutive(seq):\n    \"\"\"Check if the given sequence of letters is consecutive.\"\"\"\n    return ord(seq[1]) == ord(seq[0]) + 1 and ord(seq[2]) == ord(seq[1]) + 1\n\ndef determine_result(cards, new_card):\n    \"\"\"Determine the result based on the current cards and the new card.\"\"\"\n    # Check for Peng\n    if cards.count(new_card) >= 2:\n        return 1  # Peng\n\n    # Check for Chi\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if is_consecutive(sorted_cards[i:i+3]):\n            return 2  # Chi\n\n    return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"IVAJUKTRNLQOH\")\n\n# Rounds\nrounds = [\n    ('S', 'N'),\n    ('X', 'U'),\n    ('B', 'Q'),\n    ('C', 'S'),\n    ('V', None)  # No card to remove in the final round\n]\n\n# Process each round\nfor new_card, remove_card in rounds:\n    cards.append(new_card)\n    if remove_card:\n        cards.remove(remove_card)\n    result = determine_result(cards, new_card)\n\n# The result of the final round\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rounds and determine the result for the final round based on the rules provided. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the final round's result is \"Peng\" (1). However, let's ensure the logic is correct by reviewing the steps and conditions applied in the code:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: We start with the cards \"IVAJUKTRNLQOH\".\n2. **Round 1**: Add 'S', remove 'N'. Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n3. **Round 2**: Add 'X', remove 'U'. Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n4. **Round 3**: Add 'B', remove 'Q'. Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n5. **Round 4**: Add 'C', remove 'S'. Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n6. **Round 5**: Add 'V'. Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\nThe code correctly implements the logic for checking \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" and processes each round by adding and removing cards as specified. The final result of 1 indicates that a \"Peng\" condition was met in the last round.\n\nGiven the rules and the execution result, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
