  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined.

When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. For example, ABC, OPQ, etc.\n5.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the card game based on the given rules and determine the result of the final round. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `POORAAXVJGKFE`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `O` card: `POORAAXVJGKFE` becomes `POORAAXVJGKFE` + `O`.\n   - Remove a `X` card: `POORAAXVJGKFE` + `O` becomes `POORAAVJGKFE` + `O`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We have `OOO` in the cards, so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a `N` card: `POORAAVJGKFE` becomes `POORAAVJGKFE` + `N`.\n   - Remove a `J` card: `POORAAVJGKFE` + `N` becomes `POORAAVKGFE` + `N`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `N`.\n   - Result is \"Pass\" (0).\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `Q` card: `POORAAVKGFE` becomes `POORAAVKGFE` + `Q`.\n   - Remove a `G` card: `POORAAVKGFE` + `Q` becomes `POORAAVKFE` + `Q`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `Q`.\n   - Result is \"Pass\" (0).\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add a `A` card: `POORAAVKFE` becomes `POORAAVKFE` + `A`.\n   - Remove a `O` card: `POORAAVKFE` + `A` becomes `PORAAVKFE` + `A`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We have `AAA` in the cards, so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add a `A` card: `PORAAVKFE` becomes `PORAAVKFE` + `A`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We have `AAAA` in the cards, so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\nThe final result of the last round is \"Peng\" (1). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
