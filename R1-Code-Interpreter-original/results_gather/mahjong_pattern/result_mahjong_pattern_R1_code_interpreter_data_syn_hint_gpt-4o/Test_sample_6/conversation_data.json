    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the game and determine the result for each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: We start with the cards \"VQFIUPNXEKOEJ\".\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - **Add a Card**: We add an \"E\" card.\n   - **Check for \"Peng\"**: We need to check if there are two identical cards in hand and the newly added card is the same as these two cards. Before adding, we have two \"E\" cards in hand. After adding, we have three \"E\" cards.\n   - **Determine Result**: Since we have three \"E\" cards, the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n   - **Remove a Card**: We remove a \"V\" card. However, this does not affect the result determination.\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - **Add a Card**: We add a \"P\" card.\n   - **Check for \"Peng\"**: We need to check again for the \"Peng\" condition. After adding, we do not have three identical cards.\n   - **Determine Result**: Since the condition is not met, the result is \"Pass\" (0).\n\nThe final result for Round 2 is \"Pass\" (0).\n\nTherefore, the number judged in the final round is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
