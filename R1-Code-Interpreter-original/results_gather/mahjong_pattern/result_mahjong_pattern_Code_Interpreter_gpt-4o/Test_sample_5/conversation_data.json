  "question": "There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:1. Initially, there are 13 cards.\n2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4. If the newly added card does not meet the condition in rule 3, the result is determined as \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n5. The removed card does not affect the result determination.\nGiven the initial cards:YQILCUCZEAXNK\n\nRound 1: Add a H card and remove a E card.\nRound 2: Add a C card\n\nBased on the above information, determine the number judged in the final round.\nReturn your answer with the format <<<x>>>, where x is 0 for Pass, 1 for Peng.",
