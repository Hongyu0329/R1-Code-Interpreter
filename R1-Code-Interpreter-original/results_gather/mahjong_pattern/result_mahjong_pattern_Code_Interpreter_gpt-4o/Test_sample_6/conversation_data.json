Then, one card is removed.\n3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1.\n4.

    "\nassistant > To determine the result of the final round, we need to follow the game rules and track the cards in hand after each round.\n\n### Initial Cards:\n- VQFIUPNXEKOEJ\n\n### Round 1:\n- Add an E card: VQFIUPNXEKOEJE\n- Remove a V card: QFIUPNXEKOEJE\n\nNow, we have two E cards in hand.\n\n### Round 2:\n- Add a P card: QFIUPNXEKOEJEP\n\nIn this round, we need to check if the newly added card (P) forms a triplet with two identical cards already in hand. Let's count the occurrences of each card in hand after adding the P card:\n\n- Q: 1\n- F: 1\n- I: 1\n- U: 1\n- P: 2\n- N: 1\n- X: 1\n- E: 2\n- K: 1\n- O: 1\n- J: 1\n\nThe newly added card is P, and there are only two P cards in hand, not three. Therefore, the condition for \"Peng\" is not met.\n\n### Result:\nThe result for the final round is \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```\n<<<0>>>\n```"
