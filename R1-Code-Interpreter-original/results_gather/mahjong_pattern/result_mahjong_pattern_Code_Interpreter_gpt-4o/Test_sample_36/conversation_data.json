    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the game according to the rules provided. We'll start with the initial set of cards and process each round by adding a new card, checking for \"Peng\" or \"Chi,\" and then removing a card. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Cards:** SRNVLXKWYKRPB\n\n2. **Round 1:**\n   - Add a T card: SRNVLXKWYKRPBT\n   - Remove a N card: SRVLXKWYKRPBT\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with T).\n   - Result: Pass (0)\n\n3. **Round 2:**\n   - Add a Z card: SRVLXKWYKRPBTZ\n   - Remove a R card: SVLXKWYKRPBTZ\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with Z).\n   - Result: Pass (0)\n\n4. **Round 3:**\n   - Add a V card: SVLXKWYKRPBTZV\n   - Remove a W card: SVLXKYKRPBTZV\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with V).\n   - Result: Pass (0)\n\n5. **Round 4:**\n   - Add a R card: SVLXKYKRPBTZVR\n   - Remove a T card: SVLXKYKRPBZVR\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with R).\n   - Result: Pass (0)\n\n6. **Round 5:**\n   - Add a R card: SVLXKYKRPBZVRR\n   - Check for \"Peng\" or \"Chi\":\n     - \"Peng\" (three R cards: R, R, R).\n   - Result: Peng (1)\n\nThe result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<1>>>}\n\\]"
