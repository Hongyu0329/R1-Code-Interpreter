    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the game according to the rules provided. We'll start with the initial set of cards and process each round by adding a new card, checking for \"Peng\" or \"Chi,\" and then removing a specified card. Let's go through each round step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: PARMYQEXCGSRN\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add: I\n   - Remove: Y\n   - Cards: PARMIQEXCGSRN\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with I).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add: Q\n   - Remove: R\n   - Cards: PAMIQEXCGSRNQ\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with Q).\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add: R\n   - Remove: R\n   - Cards: PAMIQEXCGSRNQ\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with R).\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add: N\n   - Remove: I\n   - Cards: PAMQEXCGSRNQN\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - No \"Chi\" (no consecutive sequence with N).\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add: G\n   - Cards: PAMQEXCGSRNQNG\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No \"Peng\" (no three identical cards).\n     - Check for \"Chi\":\n       - Possible sequences: EFG, FGH, GHI, etc.\n       - G can form a sequence with E and F (EFG).\n\nSince \"Chi\" is found in the final round, the result is determined as \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2.\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<2>>>}\n\\]"
