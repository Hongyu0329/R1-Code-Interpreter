    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards according to the rules provided. We start with the initial set of cards and then perform the operations for each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the initial cards \"ASCQPGYIKNVBD\".\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add an \"I\" card.\n   - Remove a \"D\" card.\n   - Check if there are three \"I\" cards in hand after the addition.\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a \"V\" card.\n   - Check if there are three \"V\" cards in hand after the addition.\n\nWe will write a Python script to simulate these operations and determine the result for the final round.\n\n```python\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"ASCQPGYIKNVBD\")\n\n# Round 1: Add 'I', Remove 'D'\ncards.append('I')\ncards.remove('D')\n\n# Check for \"Peng\" in Round 1\nif cards.count('I') >= 3:\n    round_1_result = 1\nelse:\n    round_1_result = 0\n\n# Round 2: Add 'V'\ncards.append('V')\n\n# Check for \"Peng\" in Round 2\nif cards.count('V') >= 3:\n    round_2_result = 1\nelse:\n    round_2_result = 0\n\n# Output the result of the final round\nprint(round_2_result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the result of the final round.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Pass,\" represented by the number 0. This means that after adding the \"V\" card in Round 2, there were not three \"V\" cards in hand, so the condition for \"Peng\" was not met.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
