    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the game and determine the result for the given round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: We start with the cards \"QPDLJYCRXBSHN\".\n2. **Round 1**: We add a \"Y\" card to the hand.\n\nNow, we need to check if the condition for \"Peng\" is met:\n\n- We need to have two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card should be the same as these two cards.\n\nLet's analyze the cards:\n\n- Initial cards: Q, P, D, L, J, Y, C, R, X, B, S, H, N\n- After adding the new card \"Y\", the cards are: Q, P, D, L, J, Y, C, R, X, B, S, H, N, Y\n\nWe need to check if there are two \"Y\" cards already in hand before adding the new \"Y\" card. If so, the result is \"Peng\" (1); otherwise, it's \"Pass\" (0).\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this check:\n\n```python\n# Initial cards\ninitial_cards = \"QPDLJYCRXBSHN\"\n\n# New card to be added\nnew_card = \"Y\"\n\n# Count occurrences of the new card in the initial cards\ncount_new_card = initial_cards.count(new_card)\n\n# Determine the result\nresult = 1 if count_new_card >= 2 else 0\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will count the occurrences of the card \"Y\" in the initial set of cards and determine if the result is \"Peng\" or \"Pass\". Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result is \"Pass\" (0). This means that before adding the new \"Y\" card, there were not already two \"Y\" cards in the initial set of cards. Therefore, the condition for \"Peng\" is not met.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
