    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the card game based on the given rules and determine the result of the final round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: \"YQILCUCZEAXNK\".\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a \"H\" card.\n   - Remove an \"E\" card.\n   - Check for the \"Peng\" condition: We need to see if there are two identical cards in hand and if the newly added card is the same as these two cards. If so, the result is \"Peng\" (1); otherwise, it's \"Pass\" (0).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a \"C\" card.\n   - Check for the \"Peng\" condition again with the updated set of cards.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"YQILCUCZEAXNK\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.append(\"H\")  # Add H\ncards.remove(\"E\")  # Remove E\n\n# Check for \"Peng\" in Round 1\ndef check_peng(cards, new_card):\n    card_count = {}\n    for card in cards:\n        if card in card_count:\n            card_count[card] += 1\n        else:\n            card_count[card] = 1\n    # Check if there are two identical cards and the new card is the same\n    for card, count in card_count.items():\n        if count >= 2 and card == new_card:\n            return 1  # Peng\n    return 0  # Pass\n\n# Round 2\ncards.append(\"C\")  # Add C\n\n# Determine the result for the final round\nresult = check_peng(cards, \"C\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the card game according to the rules and determine the result of the final round. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This means that after adding the \"C\" card in Round 2, there were already two \"C\" cards in hand, satisfying the condition for \"Peng.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
