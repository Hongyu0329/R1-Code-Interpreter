    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards while checking the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" in each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `SDCBJJBLPELSN`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a card 'S'.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We need three 'S' cards. Initially, we have one 'S', so after adding, we have two 'S' cards. No \"Peng\".\n   - Check for \"Chi\": We need a sequence. No sequence with 'S'.\n   - Remove a card 'S'. The cards remain unchanged in terms of 'S' count.\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add a card 'L'.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We need three 'L' cards. Initially, we have one 'L', so after adding, we have two 'L' cards. No \"Peng\".\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No sequence with 'L'.\n   - Remove a card 'C'.\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a card 'S'.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We need three 'S' cards. We have two 'S' cards, so after adding, we have three 'S' cards. \"Peng\" is achieved.\n   - Since \"Peng\" takes precedence, we don't need to check for \"Chi\".\n   - Remove a card 'B'.\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add a card 'H'.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three 'H' cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No sequence with 'H'.\n   - Remove a card 'S'.\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add a card 'S'.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We need three 'S' cards. We have two 'S' cards, so after adding, we have three 'S' cards. \"Peng\" is achieved.\n\nSince \"Peng\" is achieved in the final round, the result is 1. Let's implement this logic in Python to verify:\n\n```python\ndef determine_result(initial_cards, rounds):\n    cards = list(initial_cards)\n    \n    for add_card, remove_card in rounds:\n        # Add the new card\n        cards.append(add_card)\n        \n        # Check for \"Peng\"\n        if cards.count(add_card) >= 3:\n            return 1  # Peng\n        \n        # Check for \"Chi\"\n        sorted_cards = sorted(cards)\n        for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n            if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n                return 2  # Chi\n        \n        # Remove the specified card\n        cards.remove(remove_card)\n    \n    return 0  # Pass\n\ninitial_cards = \"SDCBJJBLPELSN\"\nrounds = [('S', 'S'), ('L', 'C'), ('S', 'B'), ('H', 'S'), ('S', None)]\nresult = determine_result(initial_cards, rounds)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the result.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This means that in the final round, the condition for \"Peng\" was met, as there were three 'S' cards present.\n\n<<<1>>>"
