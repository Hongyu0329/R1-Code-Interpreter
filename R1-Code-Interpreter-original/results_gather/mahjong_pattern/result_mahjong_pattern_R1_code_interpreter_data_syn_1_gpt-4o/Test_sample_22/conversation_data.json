    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the card game based on the given rules and determine the result for each round. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `EGQTSOAEGBQLU`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `Y` card: `EGQTSOAEGBQLUY`.\n   - Remove a `T` card: `EGQSOAEGBQLUY`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards, so no \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence with `Y`, so no \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add an `E` card: `EGQSOAEGBQLUYE`.\n   - Remove an `E` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUYE`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards, so no \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence with `E`, so no \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `Q` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUYEQ`.\n   - Remove a `Y` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUEQ`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards, so no \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence with `Q`, so no \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add a `G` card: `GQSOAEGBQLUEQG`.\n   - Remove a `Q` card: `GSOAEGBQLUEQG`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - Three `G` cards, so \"Peng\" (1).\n   - Result: \"Peng\" (1).\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add a `Q` card: `GSOAEGBQLUEQGQ`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\":\n     - No three identical cards, so no \"Peng\".\n     - No consecutive sequence with `Q`, so no \"Chi\".\n   - Result: \"Pass\" (0).\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef determine_result(cards, new_card):\n    # Add the new card\n    cards.append(new_card)\n    \n    # Check for \"Peng\"\n    card_count = Counter(cards)\n    if card_count[new_card] >= 3:\n        return 1  # Peng\n    \n    # Check for \"Chi\"\n    sorted_cards = sorted(set(cards))\n    new_card_index = sorted_cards.index(new_card)\n    \n    # Check for consecutive sequence\n    if new_card_index > 0 and new_card_index < len(sorted_cards) - 1:\n        if (ord(sorted_cards[new_card_index - 1]) == ord(new_card) - 1 and\n            ord(sorted_cards[new_card_index + 1]) == ord(new_card) + 1):\n            return 2  # Chi\n    \n    return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"EGQTSOAEGBQLU\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.remove('T')\ndetermine_result(cards, 'Y')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.remove('E')\ndetermine_result(cards, 'E')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.remove('Y')\ndetermine_result(cards, 'Q')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.remove('Q')\ndetermine_result(cards, 'G')\n\n# Round 5\nresult = determine_result(cards, 'Q')\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of the final round.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This means that in the final round, there were three identical cards, which triggered the \"Peng\" condition.\n\n<<<1>>>"
