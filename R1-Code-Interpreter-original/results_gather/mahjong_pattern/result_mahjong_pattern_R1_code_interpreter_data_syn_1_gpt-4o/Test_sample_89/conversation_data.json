    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards while checking the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" at each step. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `VVWOKGGWEHSYF`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `V` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We have `VVV`, so this is a \"Peng\" (1).\n   - Remove a `G` card.\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add an `H` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `H`.\n   - Remove a `V` card.\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `Q` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `Q`.\n   - Remove an `S` card.\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add an `F` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": No consecutive sequence with `F`.\n   - Remove a `G` card.\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add a `W` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\": No three identical cards.\n   - Check for \"Chi\": Check for consecutive sequences.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\ndef check_peng(cards, new_card):\n    return cards.count(new_card) >= 2\n\ndef check_chi(cards, new_card):\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef determine_result(cards, new_card):\n    if check_peng(cards, new_card):\n        return 1\n    elif check_chi(cards, new_card):\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 0\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"VVWOKGGWEHSYF\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.append('V')\nresult = determine_result(cards, 'V')\ncards.remove('G')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.append('H')\nresult = determine_result(cards, 'H')\ncards.remove('V')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.append('Q')\nresult = determine_result(cards, 'Q')\ncards.remove('S')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.append('F')\nresult = determine_result(cards, 'F')\ncards.remove('G')\n\n# Round 5\ncards.append('W')\nresult = determine_result(cards, 'W')\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result of the final round.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This means that during the final round, there were three identical cards, which triggered the \"Peng\" condition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
