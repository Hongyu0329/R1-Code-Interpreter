    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards while checking the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" in each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial set of cards: `GASNDQYSZLRCW`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add `H` and remove `W`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add `E` and remove `N`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add `I` and remove `Z`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add `P` and remove `D`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add `I`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\nFor each round, we need to:\n- Check if there are two identical cards in hand and the new card is the same as these two cards for \"Peng\".\n- Check if the new card and any two cards in hand can form a consecutive sequence for \"Chi\".\n- Determine the result based on the rules.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\ndef check_peng(cards, new_card):\n    return cards.count(new_card) >= 2\n\ndef check_chi(cards, new_card):\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef determine_result(cards, new_card):\n    if check_peng(cards, new_card):\n        return 1  # Peng\n    elif check_chi(cards, new_card):\n        return 2  # Chi\n    else:\n        return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"GASNDQYSZLRCW\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.remove('W')\ncards.append('H')\nresult1 = determine_result(cards, 'H')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.remove('N')\ncards.append('E')\nresult2 = determine_result(cards, 'E')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.remove('Z')\ncards.append('I')\nresult3 = determine_result(cards, 'I')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.remove('D')\ncards.append('P')\nresult4 = determine_result(cards, 'P')\n\n# Round 5\ncards.append('I')\nresult5 = determine_result(cards, 'I')\n\nprint(result5)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate each round and determine the result for the final round. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This means that in the final round, there were two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card was the same as these two cards.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
