    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the rounds of the card game based on the given rules. We will start with the initial set of cards and then process each round by adding a new card and removing a specified card. After each addition, we will check for the conditions of \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" to determine the result of that round.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial set of cards: `POORAAXVJGKFE`.\n2. For each round, add the new card and remove the specified card.\n3. After adding the new card, check for the \"Peng\" condition: if there are two identical cards in hand and the new card is the same as these two cards.\n4. If \"Peng\" is not satisfied, check for the \"Chi\" condition: if two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence.\n5. If neither condition is satisfied, the result is \"Pass.\"\n6. \"Peng\" takes precedence over \"Chi.\"\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\ndef check_peng(cards, new_card):\n    return cards.count(new_card) >= 2\n\ndef check_chi(cards, new_card):\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"POORAAXVJGKFE\")\n\n# Rounds\nrounds = [\n    ('O', 'X'),\n    ('N', 'J'),\n    ('Q', 'G'),\n    ('A', 'O'),\n    ('A', None)  # No card to remove in the last round\n]\n\nresult = 0\nfor new_card, remove_card in rounds:\n    cards.append(new_card)\n    if remove_card:\n        cards.remove(remove_card)\n    \n    if check_peng(cards, new_card):\n        result = 1\n    elif check_chi(cards, new_card):\n        result = 2\n    else:\n        result = 0\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rounds and determine the result of the final round based on the rules provided. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This means that in the final round, the conditions for \"Peng\" were met, where there were two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card was the same as these two cards.\n\n<<<1>>>"
