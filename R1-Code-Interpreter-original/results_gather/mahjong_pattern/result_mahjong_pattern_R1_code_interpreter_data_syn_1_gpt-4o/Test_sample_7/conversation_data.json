    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards according to the rules provided. We start with the initial set of cards and then perform the operations for each round, checking if the conditions for \"Peng\" are met.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Cards**: We start with the cards \"NNTMOFBJDEGAO\".\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a \"N\" card: The cards become \"NNTMOFBJDEGAON\".\n   - Remove a \"T\" card: The cards become \"NNMOFBJDEGAON\".\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We have three \"N\" cards, so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add an \"O\" card: The cards become \"NNMOFBJDEGAONO\".\n   - Check for \"Peng\": We have three \"O\" cards, so the result is \"Peng\" (1).\n\nSince the result of the final round is determined by the last operation, we need to check the conditions after the second round. Let's implement this logic in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"NNTMOFBJDEGAO\")\n\n# Round 1: Add 'N', Remove 'T'\ncards.append('N')\ncards.remove('T')\n\n# Check for \"Peng\" in Round 1\nif cards.count('N') >= 3:\n    result_round_1 = 1\nelse:\n    result_round_1 = 0\n\n# Round 2: Add 'O'\ncards.append('O')\n\n# Check for \"Peng\" in Round 2\nif cards.count('O') >= 3:\n    result_round_2 = 1\nelse:\n    result_round_2 = 0\n\n# The result of the final round is the result of Round 2\nprint(result_round_2)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the result of the final round.",
    "The code execution confirms that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This is because, after the second round, there are three \"O\" cards in hand, which satisfies the condition for \"Peng.\"\n\n<<<1>>>"
