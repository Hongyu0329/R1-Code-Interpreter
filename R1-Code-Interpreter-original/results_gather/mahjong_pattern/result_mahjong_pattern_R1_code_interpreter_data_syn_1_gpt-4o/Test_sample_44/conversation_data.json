    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards while checking the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" at each step. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `KJRMXBVILFELC`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add `L`, remove `J`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add `N`, remove `M`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add `Z`, remove `I`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add `L`, remove `V`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add `G`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\nFor each round, we need to:\n- Check if the new card forms a \"Peng\" with two existing identical cards.\n- Check if the new card forms a \"Chi\" with two existing cards in a consecutive sequence.\n- Determine the result based on the rules, with \"Peng\" taking precedence over \"Chi\".\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\ndef check_peng(cards, new_card):\n    return cards.count(new_card) >= 2\n\ndef check_chi(cards, new_card):\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef determine_result(cards, new_card):\n    if check_peng(cards, new_card):\n        return 1  # Peng\n    elif check_chi(cards, new_card):\n        return 2  # Chi\n    else:\n        return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"KJRMXBVILFELC\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.remove('J')\ncards.append('L')\nresult1 = determine_result(cards, 'L')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.remove('M')\ncards.append('N')\nresult2 = determine_result(cards, 'N')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.remove('I')\ncards.append('Z')\nresult3 = determine_result(cards, 'Z')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.remove('V')\ncards.append('L')\nresult4 = determine_result(cards, 'L')\n\n# Round 5\nresult5 = determine_result(cards, 'G')\n\nprint(result5)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate each round and determine the result for the final round. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Chi,\" represented by the number 2. This means that in the final round, the new card `G` forms a consecutive sequence with two other cards in hand. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
