    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards while checking the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" in each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial set of cards: `EJXXLNRZHAGDQ`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add card `I`.\n   - Remove card `H`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add card `F`.\n   - Remove card `A`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add card `K`.\n   - Remove card `E`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add card `G`.\n   - Remove card `J`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n6. **Round 5**:\n   - Add card `R`.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\nFor each round, we need to:\n- Check if the new card forms a \"Peng\" with any two identical cards in hand.\n- Check if the new card forms a \"Chi\" with any two cards in hand that can form a consecutive sequence.\n- Determine the result based on the rules, with \"Peng\" taking precedence over \"Chi\".\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\ndef check_peng(cards, new_card):\n    # Check for \"Peng\"\n    return cards.count(new_card) >= 2\n\ndef check_chi(cards, new_card):\n    # Check for \"Chi\"\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef determine_result(cards, new_card):\n    if check_peng(cards, new_card):\n        return 1  # Peng\n    elif check_chi(cards, new_card):\n        return 2  # Chi\n    else:\n        return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"EJXXLNRZHAGDQ\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.remove('H')\ncards.append('I')\nresult1 = determine_result(cards, 'I')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.remove('A')\ncards.append('F')\nresult2 = determine_result(cards, 'F')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.remove('E')\ncards.append('K')\nresult3 = determine_result(cards, 'K')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.remove('J')\ncards.append('G')\nresult4 = determine_result(cards, 'G')\n\n# Round 5\ncards.append('R')\nresult5 = determine_result(cards, 'R')\n\nprint(result5)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate each round, check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\", and finally print the result of the last round. Let's execute it to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `1`, which indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng\". This means that in the final round, the conditions for \"Peng\" were met, where the newly added card `R` formed a set of three identical cards with two existing cards in hand.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
