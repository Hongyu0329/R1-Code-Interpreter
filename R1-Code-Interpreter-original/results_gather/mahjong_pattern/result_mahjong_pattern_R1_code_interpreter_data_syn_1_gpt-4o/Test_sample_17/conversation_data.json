    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of adding and removing cards while checking the conditions for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\" in each round. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the initial set of cards: `SCABRLDAVXJHZ`.\n\n2. **Round 1**:\n   - Add a `K` card.\n   - Remove an `H` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n3. **Round 2**:\n   - Add an `M` card.\n   - Remove an `L` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n4. **Round 3**:\n   - Add a `C` card.\n   - Remove an `R` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\n5. **Round 4**:\n   - Add a `C` card.\n   - Check for \"Peng\" and \"Chi\".\n\nFor each round, we need to:\n- Check if there are two identical cards in hand and the newly added card is the same as these two cards for \"Peng\".\n- Check if two cards in hand and the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence for \"Chi\".\n- Determine the result based on the conditions.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the result of the final round.\n\n```python\ndef check_peng_chi(cards, new_card):\n    # Check for Peng\n    if cards.count(new_card) >= 2:\n        return 1  # Peng\n\n    # Check for Chi\n    sorted_cards = sorted(cards + [new_card])\n    for i in range(len(sorted_cards) - 2):\n        if ord(sorted_cards[i+1]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 1 and ord(sorted_cards[i+2]) == ord(sorted_cards[i]) + 2:\n            return 2  # Chi\n\n    return 0  # Pass\n\n# Initial cards\ncards = list(\"SCABRLDAVXJHZ\")\n\n# Round 1\ncards.append('K')\ncards.remove('H')\nresult_round_1 = check_peng_chi(cards, 'K')\n\n# Round 2\ncards.append('M')\ncards.remove('L')\nresult_round_2 = check_peng_chi(cards, 'M')\n\n# Round 3\ncards.append('C')\ncards.remove('R')\nresult_round_3 = check_peng_chi(cards, 'C')\n\n# Round 4\ncards.append('C')\nresult_round_4 = check_peng_chi(cards, 'C')\n\n# Output the result of the final round\nprint(result_round_4)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the rounds and determine the result of the final round based on the rules provided. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code execution indicates that the result of the final round is \"Peng,\" represented by the number 1. This means that in the final round, there were two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card was the same as these two cards, satisfying the \"Peng\" condition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
