    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book A must be to the right of book D.**\n   - This means D must be placed before A.\n\n2. **Book G must be to the right of book B.**\n   - This means B must be placed before G.\n\n3. **Book D must be to the left of book E.**\n   - This means D must be placed before E.\n\n4. **Book C must be to the left of book A.**\n   - This means C must be placed before A.\n\n5. **Book D must be adjacent to book E.**\n   - This means D and E must be next to each other.\n\n6. **Book A cannot be placed in position 4.**\n   - This means A cannot be in the middle position.\n\n7. **Book G must be placed in position 7.**\n   - This fixes G at the last position.\n\n8. **Book G must be to the right of book C.**\n   - This means C must be placed before G.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since G is fixed at position 7, B must be placed before position 7.\n- C must also be placed before position 7, and before A.\n- D and E must be adjacent, and D must be before E.\n- A cannot be in position 4, and must be after D and C.\n\nLet's start placing the books:\n\n1. **Position 7:** G (fixed)\n2. **Position 6:** Since D and E must be adjacent and D must be before E, and A must be after D, E cannot be in position 6. So, E must be in position 5 and D in position 4.\n3. **Position 5:** E (since D is in position 4)\n4. **Position 4:** D\n5. **Position 3:** A cannot be in position 4, so A can be in position 3.\n6. **Position 2:** C must be before A, so C can be in position 2.\n7. **Position 1:** B must be before G, and the only remaining position is 1.\n\nThus, the arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"]>>>"
