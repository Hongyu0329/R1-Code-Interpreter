    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book A cannot be placed in position 4.**\n2. **Book G cannot be placed in position 3.**\n3. **Book F cannot be placed in position 5.**\n4. **Book C cannot be placed in position 3.**\n5. **Book A must be adjacent to book F.**\n6. **Book E must be adjacent to book A.**\n7. **Book E cannot be placed in position 4.**\n8. **Book G cannot be placed in position 3.** (This is a repeat of constraint 2)\n9. **Book B must be placed in position 2.**\n\nLet's start by placing book B in position 2, as it is a fixed position:\n\n- Position 2: B\n\nNext, consider the adjacency constraints for books A, F, and E:\n\n- Book A must be adjacent to book F.\n- Book E must be adjacent to book A.\n\nThis means A, F, and E must be placed in consecutive positions. Let's denote these positions as a block [E, A, F] or [F, A, E] since A must be between E and F.\n\nNow, consider the constraints on specific positions:\n\n- A cannot be in position 4.\n- E cannot be in position 4.\n- F cannot be in position 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try placing the block [E, A, F] in positions 3, 4, and 5:\n\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: F\n\nThis satisfies the adjacency constraints and the specific position constraints for A, E, and F.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Position 1: ?\n- Position 2: B\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: F\n- Position 6: ?\n- Position 7: ?\n\nNext, consider the constraints for books G and C:\n\n- G cannot be in position 3 (already satisfied).\n- C cannot be in position 3 (already satisfied).\n- G cannot be in position 3 (already satisfied).\n\nSince G cannot be in position 3, it can be placed in position 1, 6, or 7. Let's try placing G in position 6:\n\n- Position 6: G\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Position 1: ?\n- Position 2: B\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: F\n- Position 6: G\n- Position 7: ?\n\nThe remaining books are C and D. Since C cannot be in position 3, it can be placed in position 1 or 7. Let's place C in position 7:\n\n- Position 7: C\n\nFinally, place the remaining book D in position 1:\n\n- Position 1: D\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: B\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: F\n- Position 6: G\n- Position 7: C\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"B\", \"E\", \"A\", \"F\", \"G\", \"C\"]>>>"
