    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book C cannot be placed in position 4.**\n2. **Book C must be placed in position 5.**  \n   - This directly places book C in position 5.\n\n3. **Book A cannot be placed in position 5.**  \n   - Since book C is already in position 5, this constraint is automatically satisfied.\n\n4. **Book D must be adjacent to book F.**  \n   - This means D and F must be next to each other.\n\n5. **Book F must be to the left of book B.**  \n   - This means F must be placed in a position before B.\n\n6. **Book G must be to the right of book B.**  \n   - This means G must be placed in a position after B.\n\n7. **Book F must be to the left of book G.**  \n   - This means F must be placed in a position before G.\n\n8. **Book E must be placed in position 4.**  \n   - This directly places book E in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- **Position 4 is occupied by E.**\n- **Position 5 is occupied by C.**\n\nNow, we need to place A, B, D, F, and G in the remaining positions: 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.\n\n- **D and F must be adjacent.**  \n  - Possible pairs for D and F are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 6), and (6, 7).\n\n- **F must be to the left of B, and F must be to the left of G.**  \n  - This means B and G must be placed after F.\n\n- **G must be to the right of B.**  \n  - This means B must be placed before G.\n\nLet's try placing D and F in positions (1, 2):\n\n- If F is in position 1, D is in position 2:\n  - B must be in position 3 (since F is to the left of B).\n  - G must be in position 6 or 7 (since G is to the right of B).\n  - A must be in the remaining position.\n\nLet's check this arrangement:\n\n1. F\n2. D\n3. B\n4. E\n5. C\n6. A\n7. G\n\n- **F is to the left of B.** ✔️\n- **G is to the right of B.** ✔️\n- **F is to the left of G.** ✔️\n- **D is adjacent to F.** ✔️\n- **A is not in position 5.** ✔️\n- **C is in position 5.** ✔️\n- **E is in position 4.** ✔️\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with this arrangement.\n\nThe final arrangement of books from left to right is:\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"D\", \"B\", \"E\", \"C\", \"A\", \"G\"]>>>"
