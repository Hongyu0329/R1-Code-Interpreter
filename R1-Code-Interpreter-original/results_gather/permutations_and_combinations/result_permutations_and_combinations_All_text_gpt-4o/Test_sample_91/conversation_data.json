    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book F cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - This means F can be in positions 1 to 6.\n\n2. **Book G must be to the left of book D.**\n   - Since D is in position 4 (from constraint 7), G must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Book E cannot be placed in position 1.**\n   - E can be in positions 2 to 7.\n\n4. **Book E must be adjacent to book C.**\n   - E and C must be next to each other.\n\n5. **Book F must be to the left of book C.**\n   - F must be in a position before C.\n\n6. **Book D must be adjacent to book F.**\n   - Since D is in position 4, F must be in position 3 or 5.\n\n7. **Book D must be placed in position 4.**\n   - This is a fixed position for D.\n\n8. **Book A must be placed in position 2.**\n   - This is a fixed position for A.\n\n9. **Book C must be to the right of book B.**\n   - B must be in a position before C.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 2 is fixed for A.**\n- **Position 4 is fixed for D.**\n\nSince D is in position 4, and F must be adjacent to D, F can be in position 3 or 5. However, F must also be to the left of C, so F should be in position 3.\n\n- **Position 3 is for F.**\n\nNow, G must be to the left of D, so G can be in position 1.\n\n- **Position 1 is for G.**\n\nNow, E must be adjacent to C, and E cannot be in position 1. Since F is in position 3 and D is in position 4, E and C must be in positions 5 and 6, respectively, to satisfy the adjacency condition. Also, F must be to the left of C, so C must be in position 6.\n\n- **Position 5 is for E.**\n- **Position 6 is for C.**\n\nFinally, B must be to the left of C, so B must be in position 7.\n\n- **Position 7 is for B.**\n\nThus, the arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"G\", \"A\", \"F\", \"D\", \"E\", \"C\", \"B\"]>>>"
