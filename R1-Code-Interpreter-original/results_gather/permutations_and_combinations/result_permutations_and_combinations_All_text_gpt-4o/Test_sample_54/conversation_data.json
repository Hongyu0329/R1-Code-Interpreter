    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book E must be to the right of book C.**\n   - This means C must be placed before E.\n\n2. **Book C cannot be placed in position 5.**\n   - C can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Book A cannot be placed in position 6.**\n   - A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n\n4. **Book B cannot be placed in position 3.**\n   - B can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n5. **Book E must be to the left of book D.**\n   - This means E must be placed before D.\n\n6. **Book D must be to the right of book B.**\n   - This means B must be placed before D.\n\n7. **Book D must be placed in position 5.**\n   - This fixes D's position at 5.\n\n8. **Book G must be to the right of book F.**\n   - This means F must be placed before G.\n\nNow, let's use these constraints to determine the positions of the books:\n\n- Since D is fixed at position 5, B must be placed in one of the positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since B must be before D).\n- C cannot be in position 5, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.\n- E must be to the right of C and to the left of D, so E can only be in position 4.\n- Since E is in position 4, C must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- B cannot be in position 3, so B can be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Since E is in position 4, B can only be in positions 1 or 2.\n- A cannot be in position 6, so A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. Since D is in position 5, A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7.\n- F must be to the left of G, so F can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and G can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n1. Place D in position 5.\n2. Place E in position 4 (since E must be to the left of D).\n3. Place C in position 3 (since C must be to the left of E and cannot be in position 5).\n4. Place B in position 2 (since B must be to the left of D and cannot be in position 3).\n5. Place A in position 1 (since A cannot be in position 6).\n6. Place F in position 6 (since F must be to the left of G).\n7. Place G in position 7 (since G must be to the right of F).\n\nThe arrangement that satisfies all the constraints is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", \"D\", \"F\", \"G\"]>>>"
