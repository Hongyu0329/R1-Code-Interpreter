    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book A must be adjacent to book F.**\n   - This means A and F must be next to each other in the sequence.\n\n2. **Book E must be adjacent to book F.**\n   - This means E and F must also be next to each other in the sequence.\n\n3. **Book B cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - B can be in any position except position 2.\n\n4. **Book F cannot be placed in position 1.**\n   - F can be in any position except position 1.\n\n5. **Book F must be to the right of book C.**\n   - This means C must be placed before F in the sequence.\n\n6. **Book D must be to the left of book E.**\n   - This means D must be placed before E in the sequence.\n\n7. **Book C cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - C can be in any position except position 2.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books while satisfying all these constraints:\n\n- Since A and E both need to be adjacent to F, the possible triplet arrangements for A, E, and F are: AFE, AEF, FAE, FEA, EAF, EFA. However, considering that F must be to the right of C, we can eliminate FAE and FEA.\n\n- Let's consider the triplet AFE. In this case, F is in the middle, satisfying the adjacency requirement for both A and E. \n\n- Since F cannot be in position 1, the possible positions for the triplet AFE are (2, 3, 4) or (3, 4, 5) or (4, 5, 6).\n\n- Let's place AFE in positions (3, 4, 5). This means:\n  - A is in position 3\n  - F is in position 4\n  - E is in position 5\n\n- Now, we need to place C, D, and B in the remaining positions (1, 2, 6).\n\n- Since F must be to the right of C, C can only be in position 1 or 2. However, C cannot be in position 2, so C must be in position 1.\n\n- D must be to the left of E, so D must be in position 2.\n\n- Finally, B must be in position 6, as it cannot be in position 2.\n\nThus, the arrangement of the books from left to right is:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"D\", \"A\", \"F\", \"E\", \"B\"]>>>"
