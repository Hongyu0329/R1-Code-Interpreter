    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book C must be placed in position 3.**\n   - This is a fixed position for book C: C is in position 3.\n\n2. **Book E must be to the right of book F.**\n   - This means F must be placed in a position that is numerically less than E.\n\n3. **Book A cannot be placed in position 3.**\n   - Since C is already in position 3, this constraint is automatically satisfied.\n\n4. **Book C must be adjacent to book D.**\n   - Since C is in position 3, D must be in either position 2 or 4.\n\n5. **Book C cannot be placed in position 1.**\n   - This constraint is already satisfied as C is in position 3.\n\n6. **Book E must be adjacent to book A.**\n   - E and A must be placed in consecutive positions.\n\n7. **Book F must be to the left of book C.**\n   - F must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books:\n\n- Since C is in position 3, D must be in position 2 or 4. Let's try D in position 2 first.\n- If D is in position 2, F must be in position 1 (since F must be to the left of C).\n- Now, we have positions 4, 5, and 6 left for A, B, and E.\n- E must be to the right of F, which is already satisfied since F is in position 1.\n- E must be adjacent to A, so they must occupy two consecutive positions among 4, 5, and 6.\n- Let's try placing A in position 4 and E in position 5. This satisfies the adjacency requirement.\n- The only remaining position is 6, which will be occupied by B.\n\nLet's verify the arrangement:\n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: D\n- Position 3: C\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: E\n- Position 6: B\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n- C is in position 3.\n- E is to the right of F.\n- A is not in position 3.\n- C is adjacent to D.\n- F is to the left of C.\n- E is adjacent to A.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<[\"F\", \"D\", \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\"]>>>"
