    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book C must be to the left of book D.**\n   - This means C must be placed in a position with a lower number than D.\n\n2. **Book A must be to the left of book C.**\n   - This means A must be placed in a position with a lower number than C.\n\n3. **Book F must be placed in position 2.**\n   - This is a fixed position for book F.\n\n4. **Book A must be to the right of book E.**\n   - This means E must be placed in a position with a lower number than A.\n\n5. **Book G cannot be placed in position 6.**\n   - G cannot occupy position 6.\n\n6. **Book G cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - G cannot occupy position 2, but since F is already in position 2, this constraint is automatically satisfied.\n\n7. **Book C must be to the right of book B.**\n   - This means B must be placed in a position with a lower number than C.\n\n8. **Book G cannot be placed in position 6.**\n   - This is a repeat of constraint 5.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books on the shelf:\n\n- **Position 2 is occupied by F.**\n\n- **Constraints on G:** G cannot be in positions 2 or 6. So, G can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n\n- **Constraints on A, B, C, D, E:**\n  - A must be to the left of C, and C must be to the left of D.\n  - A must be to the right of E.\n  - C must be to the right of B.\n\nLet's start placing the books:\n\n1. **Position 1:** Place E here. (E must be to the left of A)\n\n2. **Position 2:** F is already placed here.\n\n3. **Position 3:** Place B here. (B must be to the left of C)\n\n4. **Position 4:** Place A here. (A must be to the right of E)\n\n5. **Position 5:** Place C here. (C must be to the right of B and to the left of D)\n\n6. **Position 6:** Place D here. (D must be to the right of C)\n\n7. **Position 7:** Place G here. (G cannot be in position 6, and all other constraints are satisfied)\n\nThe final arrangement of books from left to right is:\n\n<<<[\"E\", \"F\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"D\", \"G\"]>>>"
