    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book D must be adjacent to book F.**\n   - This means D and F must be next to each other.\n\n2. **Book F must be to the right of book D.**\n   - This specifies the order: D must come before F.\n\n3. **Book B must be to the right of book G.**\n   - G must come before B.\n\n4. **Book E must be placed in position 4.**\n   - E is fixed at position 4.\n\n5. **Book B cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - B cannot be in the second position.\n\n6. **Book D must be to the right of book E.**\n   - Since E is in position 4, D must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n\n7. **Book A must be adjacent to book C.**\n   - A and C must be next to each other.\n\n8. **Book F must be to the right of book A.**\n   - A must come before F.\n\n9. **Book F must be to the right of book D.**\n   - This is a repeat of constraint 2, reinforcing that D comes before F.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 4 is occupied by E.**\n- **D and F must be adjacent, with D before F, and both must be to the right of E.** Therefore, D and F can be in positions 5 and 6, or 6 and 7.\n- **A and C must be adjacent, and A must be before F.** Therefore, A and C can be in positions 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.\n- **G must be before B.** Since B cannot be in position 2, G and B can be in positions 1 and 3, or 3 and 7.\n\nLet's try to fit these constraints:\n\n- Place E in position 4.\n- Place D in position 5 and F in position 6 (D and F are adjacent, and D is to the right of E).\n- Place A in position 2 and C in position 3 (A and C are adjacent, and A is before F).\n- Place G in position 1 and B in position 7 (G is before B, and B is not in position 2).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all constraints:\n\n1. D is adjacent to F, and D is before F.\n2. G is before B.\n3. E is in position 4.\n4. B is not in position 2.\n5. D is to the right of E.\n6. A is adjacent to C.\n7. A is before F.\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"G\", \"A\", \"C\", \"E\", \"D\", \"F\", \"B\"]>>>"
