    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book D must be placed in position 4.**\n   - This is a fixed position: D is at position 4.\n\n2. **Book F cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - F can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 6.\n\n3. **Book C must be to the right of book D.**\n   - Since D is in position 4, C must be in position 5 or 6.\n\n4. **Book F must be adjacent to book B.**\n   - F and B must be next to each other.\n\n5. **Book B cannot be placed in position 3.**\n   - B can be in positions 1, 2, 5, or 6.\n\n6. **Book E cannot be placed in position 4.**\n   - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.\n\n7. **Book A must be placed in position 3.**\n   - This is a fixed position: A is at position 3.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 4 is occupied by D.**\n- **Position 3 is occupied by A.**\n\nSince C must be to the right of D, C can only be in position 5 or 6.\n\nLet's consider the possible placements for F and B, which must be adjacent:\n\n- If F is in position 1, B can be in position 2.\n- If F is in position 2, B can be in position 1 (but F cannot be in position 2, so this is not possible).\n- If F is in position 5, B can be in position 6.\n- If F is in position 6, B can be in position 5.\n\nSince B cannot be in position 3, and F cannot be in position 2, the only valid adjacent placements for F and B are:\n\n- F in position 5 and B in position 6.\n- F in position 6 and B in position 5.\n\nLet's try placing F in position 5 and B in position 6:\n\n- Position 1: E\n- Position 2: B\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: D\n- Position 5: F\n- Position 6: C\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all constraints:\n\n- D is in position 4.\n- F is not in position 2.\n- C is to the right of D.\n- F is adjacent to B.\n- B is not in position 3.\n- E is not in position 4.\n- A is in position 3.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"E\", \"B\", \"A\", \"D\", \"F\", \"C\"]>>>"
