    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book G cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - G can be placed in positions 1 to 6.\n\n2. **Book F must be to the left of book B.**\n   - F must be in a position with a lower number than B.\n\n3. **Book B must be to the right of book D.**\n   - D must be in a position with a lower number than B.\n\n4. **Book E cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - E can be placed in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n5. **Book B must be to the right of book G.**\n   - G must be in a position with a lower number than B.\n\n6. **Book D cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - D can be placed in positions 1 to 6.\n\n7. **Book D must be to the left of book G.**\n   - D must be in a position with a lower number than G.\n\n8. **Book F must be placed in position 3.**\n   - F is fixed in position 3.\n\nNow, let's use these constraints to determine the positions of the books:\n\n- Since F is in position 3, B must be in a position greater than 3 (from constraint 2).\n- D must be to the left of B (from constraint 3), so D must be in position 1 or 2.\n- G must be to the left of B (from constraint 5), so G must be in position 1 or 2.\n- D must be to the left of G (from constraint 7), so D must be in position 1 and G in position 2.\n- E cannot be in position 2 (from constraint 4), which is already occupied by G, so E can be in positions 1, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- B must be in a position greater than 3, and since D is in position 1 and G is in position 2, B can be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- Since D is in position 1, G is in position 2, and F is in position 3, B can be in position 4.\n- E can be in positions 5, 6, or 7.\n- Since G cannot be in position 7 (from constraint 1), and D cannot be in position 7 (from constraint 6), E can be in position 5.\n- This leaves positions 6 and 7 for books A and C.\n\nThus, the arrangement of the books is:\n1. D\n2. G\n3. F\n4. B\n5. E\n6. A\n7. C\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n<<<[\"D\", \"G\", \"F\", \"B\", \"E\", \"A\", \"C\"]>>>"
