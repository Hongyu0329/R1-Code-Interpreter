    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book A must be to the right of book F.**\n   - This means F must be placed before A.\n\n2. **Book E must be to the right of book B.**\n   - This means B must be placed before E.\n\n3. **Book D cannot be placed in position 3.**\n   - D cannot be in the third position.\n\n4. **Book D must be placed in position 6.**\n   - This directly places D in position 6.\n\n5. **Book D must be adjacent to book E.**\n   - Since D is in position 6, E must be in position 5.\n\n6. **Book E must be to the right of book B.**\n   - This is a repeat of constraint 2, reinforcing that B must be placed before E.\n\n7. **Book B must be to the right of book C.**\n   - This means C must be placed before B.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- **Position 6**: D (from constraint 4)\n- **Position 5**: E (from constraint 5, since E must be adjacent to D)\n- **Position 4**: B (from constraints 2 and 6, B must be before E)\n- **Position 3**: C (from constraint 7, C must be before B)\n- **Position 2**: A (from constraint 1, A must be to the right of F)\n- **Position 1**: F (from constraint 1, F must be before A)\n\nThus, the arrangement of the books from left to right is:\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"E\", \"D\"]>>>"
