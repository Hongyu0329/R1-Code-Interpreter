    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book C must be to the right of book D.**\n   - This means D must be placed in a position before C.\n\n2. **Book F must be adjacent to book A.**\n   - F and A must be next to each other.\n\n3. **Book F must be to the left of book C.**\n   - F must be placed in a position before C.\n\n4. **Book G must be to the right of book A.**\n   - G must be placed in a position after A.\n\n5. **Book G must be to the left of book E.**\n   - G must be placed in a position before E.\n\n6. **Book B must be placed in position 3.**\n   - B is fixed at position 3.\n\n7. **Book D cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - D can be placed in any position except 7.\n\n8. **Book C must be placed in position 6.**\n   - C is fixed at position 6.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 6 is occupied by C.**\n- **Position 3 is occupied by B.**\n\nNow, let's place the remaining books:\n\n- Since F must be to the left of C and adjacent to A, and C is in position 6, F can be in position 5 or 4. If F is in position 5, A must be in position 4. If F is in position 4, A must be in position 5. However, since G must be to the right of A, A cannot be in position 5 (as G would have to be in position 6 or 7, but 6 is occupied by C). Therefore, F must be in position 5 and A in position 4.\n\n- Now, G must be to the right of A (position 4) and to the left of E. The only available positions for G are 1, 2, and 7. Since G must be to the left of E, G cannot be in position 7. Therefore, G must be in position 2.\n\n- E must be to the right of G, so E must be in position 7.\n\n- D must be to the left of C (position 6) and cannot be in position 7. The only available position for D is 1.\n\nNow, we have the following arrangement:\n1. D\n2. G\n3. B\n4. A\n5. F\n6. C\n7. E\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the final arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"G\", \"B\", \"A\", \"F\", \"C\", \"E\"]>>>"
