    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book F cannot be placed in position 2.**\n2. **Book F must be placed in position 4.**  \n   - This constraint overrides the first one, so F is placed in position 4.\n\n3. **Book D must be to the right of book A.**\n4. **Book B must be to the left of book G.**\n5. **Book D must be to the right of book G.**\n6. **Book F must be to the left of book G.**  \n   - Since F is in position 4, G must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n\n7. **Book G must be to the left of book D.**\n8. **Book A must be to the left of book E.**\n9. **Book G must be to the left of book C.**\n\nNow, let's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 4 is occupied by F.**\n- **G must be to the right of F (position 4), so G can be in position 5, 6, or 7.**\n- **D must be to the right of G, so D can be in position 6 or 7 if G is in position 5, or only in position 7 if G is in position 6.**\n- **B must be to the left of G, so B can be in position 1, 2, or 3.**\n- **A must be to the left of D, so A can be in position 1, 2, or 3.**\n- **E must be to the right of A, so E can be in position 5, 6, or 7.**\n- **C must be to the right of G, so C can be in position 6 or 7.**\n\nLet's try a possible arrangement:\n\n1. **Place F in position 4.**\n2. **Place G in position 5 (since it must be to the right of F and to the left of D and C).**\n3. **Place D in position 7 (since it must be to the right of G).**\n4. **Place C in position 6 (since it must be to the right of G).**\n5. **Place B in position 1 (since it must be to the left of G).**\n6. **Place A in position 2 (since it must be to the left of D and E).**\n7. **Place E in position 3 (since it must be to the right of A).**\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- F is in position 4.\n- G is to the right of F.\n- D is to the right of G.\n- C is to the right of G.\n- B is to the left of G.\n- A is to the left of D and E.\n- E is to the right of A.\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"B\", \"A\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"C\", \"D\"]>>>"
