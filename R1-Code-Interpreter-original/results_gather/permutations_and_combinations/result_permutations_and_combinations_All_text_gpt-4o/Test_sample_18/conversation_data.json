    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book C cannot be placed in position 3.**\n   - This means C can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n2. **Book A cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - This means A can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n3. **Book C must be to the right of book F.**\n   - This implies that if F is in position x, then C must be in a position greater than x.\n\n4. **Book F must be to the left of book E.**\n   - This implies that if F is in position x, then E must be in a position greater than x.\n\n5. **Book A must be to the right of book E.**\n   - This implies that if E is in position y, then A must be in a position greater than y.\n\n6. **Book F must be to the right of book D.**\n   - This implies that if D is in position z, then F must be in a position greater than z.\n\n7. **Book A must be adjacent to book E.**\n   - This means A and E must be next to each other.\n\nNow, let's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n- Start by considering the constraints involving F, C, and E:\n  - F must be to the left of both C and E.\n  - C must be to the right of F.\n  - A must be to the right of E and adjacent to E.\n\n- Consider placing D first, since F must be to the right of D:\n  - Place D in position 1.\n\n- Place F next, since it must be to the right of D:\n  - Place F in position 2.\n\n- Place E next, since F must be to the left of E:\n  - Place E in position 3.\n\n- Place A next, since A must be adjacent to E and to the right of E:\n  - Place A in position 4.\n\n- Place C next, since C must be to the right of F and cannot be in position 3:\n  - Place C in position 5.\n\n- Finally, place B in the remaining position:\n  - Place B in position 6.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- C is not in position 3.\n- A is not in position 2.\n- C is to the right of F.\n- F is to the left of E.\n- A is to the right of E and adjacent to E.\n- F is to the right of D.\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"F\", \"E\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"]>>>"
