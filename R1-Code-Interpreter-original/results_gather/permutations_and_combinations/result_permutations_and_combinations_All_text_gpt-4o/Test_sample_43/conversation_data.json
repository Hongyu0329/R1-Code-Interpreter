    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book D cannot be placed in position 6.**\n2. **Book A cannot be placed in position 2.**\n3. **Book E must be adjacent to book C.**\n4. **Book D must be to the left of book A.**\n5. **Book C must be to the left of book A.**\n6. **Book A must be placed in position 6.**\n7. **Book C must be adjacent to book B.**\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing book A:\n\n- **Constraint 6** dictates that book A must be in position 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the placement of books C and E:\n\n- **Constraint 3** requires that book E must be adjacent to book C.\n- **Constraint 7** requires that book C must be adjacent to book B.\n\nSince book A is in position 6, book C must be placed before position 6. Let's consider possible placements for C, E, and B:\n\n- If C is in position 4, then E can be in position 3 or 5, and B can be in position 5 or 3, respectively.\n- If C is in position 5, then E can be in position 4, and B can be in position 3.\n\nLet's try placing C in position 4:\n\n- Place C in position 4.\n- Place E in position 5 (adjacent to C).\n- Place B in position 3 (adjacent to C).\n\nNow, we have the partial arrangement: [_, _, B, C, E, A].\n\nNext, let's place book D:\n\n- **Constraint 4** requires that book D must be to the left of book A.\n- **Constraint 1** states that book D cannot be in position 6.\n\nSince A is in position 6, D can be placed in any of the remaining positions 1 or 2.\n\nLet's place D in position 1:\n\n- Place D in position 1.\n\nNow, we have the partial arrangement: [D, _, B, C, E, A].\n\nFinally, place book F in the remaining position:\n\n- Place F in position 2.\n\nThe final arrangement is: [D, F, B, C, E, A].\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- D is not in position 6.\n- A is not in position 2.\n- E is adjacent to C.\n- D is to the left of A.\n- C is to the left of A.\n- A is in position 6.\n- C is adjacent to B.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"F\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", \"A\"]>>>"
