    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book F must be adjacent to book D.**\n   - This means F and D must be next to each other.\n\n2. **Book C must be adjacent to book F.**\n   - This means C must be next to F, forming a block of C, F, D or D, F, C.\n\n3. **Book F cannot be placed in position 1.**\n   - F cannot be the first book on the shelf.\n\n4. **Book B must be to the right of book G.**\n   - G must be placed before B.\n\n5. **Book B must be placed in position 3.**\n   - B is fixed at position 3.\n\n6. **Book E must be to the left of book C.**\n   - E must be placed before C.\n\n7. **Book G must be placed in position 2.**\n   - G is fixed at position 2.\n\n8. **Book A cannot be placed in position 4.**\n   - A cannot be in the fourth position.\n\n9. **Book A must be to the left of book D.**\n   - A must be placed before D.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- **Position 2** is fixed with **G**.\n- **Position 3** is fixed with **B**.\n- Since **F** cannot be in position 1, and it must be adjacent to both **D** and **C**, the possible positions for the block of C, F, D or D, F, C are 4, 5, and 6.\n- **E** must be to the left of **C**, so **E** must be in position 1.\n- **A** must be to the left of **D**, and it cannot be in position 4, so **A** must be in position 7.\n\nNow, let's place the block of C, F, D or D, F, C:\n\n- If we place **D** in position 4, then **F** in position 5, and **C** in position 6, it satisfies all the conditions:\n  - **F** is adjacent to **D** and **C**.\n  - **E** is to the left of **C**.\n  - **A** is to the left of **D**.\n\nThus, the arrangement of books from left to right is:\n\n<<<[\"E\", \"G\", \"B\", \"D\", \"F\", \"C\", \"A\"]>>>"
