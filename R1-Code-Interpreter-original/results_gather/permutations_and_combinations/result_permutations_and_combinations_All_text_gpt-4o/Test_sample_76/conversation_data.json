    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book F must be placed in position 4.**\n   - This is a fixed position for book F: F is in position 4.\n\n2. **Book E cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - E can be in any position except position 2.\n\n3. **Book B must be to the right of book F.**\n   - Since F is in position 4, B must be in one of the positions 5, 6, or 7.\n\n4. **Book A cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - A can be in any position except position 7.\n\n5. **Book E cannot be placed in position 6.**\n   - E can be in any position except positions 2 and 6.\n\n6. **Book A cannot be placed in position 4.**\n   - A can be in any position except positions 4 and 7.\n\n7. **Book A must be to the left of book C.**\n   - A must be in a position with a lower number than C.\n\n8. **Book A must be to the right of book F.**\n   - Since F is in position 4, A must be in one of the positions 5, 6, or 7.\n\n9. **Book A must be to the right of book D.**\n   - D must be in a position with a lower number than A.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 4**: F (fixed)\n- **Position 5, 6, or 7**: A (since A must be to the right of F)\n- **Position 5, 6, or 7**: B (since B must be to the right of F)\n- **Position 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7**: E (since E cannot be in positions 2 or 6)\n- **Position 1, 2, or 3**: D (since D must be to the left of A)\n- **Position 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7**: C (since C must be to the right of A)\n- **Position 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7**: G (no specific constraints)\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. **Position 1**: D (since D must be to the left of A)\n2. **Position 2**: G (E cannot be here)\n3. **Position 3**: E (E cannot be in positions 2 or 6)\n4. **Position 4**: F (fixed)\n5. **Position 5**: A (A must be to the right of F and to the left of C)\n6. **Position 6**: C (C must be to the right of A)\n7. **Position 7**: B (B must be to the right of F)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- F is in position 4.\n- E is not in position 2 or 6.\n- B is to the right of F.\n- A is not in position 7.\n- A is not in position 4.\n- A is to the left of C.\n- A is to the right of F.\n- A is to the right of D.\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"G\", \"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"]>>>"
