    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book G cannot be placed in position 3.**\n   - G can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Book F must be to the right of book E.**\n   - If E is in position x, then F must be in a position greater than x.\n\n3. **Book A must be to the right of book G.**\n   - If G is in position y, then A must be in a position greater than y.\n\n4. **Book D must be to the right of book F.**\n   - If F is in position z, then D must be in a position greater than z.\n\n5. **Book C must be to the left of book G.**\n   - If G is in position y, then C must be in a position less than y.\n\n6. **Book E must be to the right of book B.**\n   - If B is in position w, then E must be in a position greater than w.\n\n7. **Book A must be placed in position 7.**\n   - A is fixed in position 7.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the books:\n\n- Since A is in position 7, G must be in positions 1 to 6.\n- C must be to the left of G, so C must be in positions 1 to 5 if G is in position 6.\n- E must be to the left of F, and B must be to the left of E.\n- D must be to the right of F.\n\nLet's try placing G in position 6 (since it cannot be in position 3 and A is in position 7):\n\n- G = 6\n- A = 7\n- C must be in positions 1 to 5. Let's place C in position 1.\n- B must be to the left of E, and E must be to the left of F, and F must be to the left of D.\n- Let's try placing B in position 2, E in position 3, F in position 4, and D in position 5.\n\nThis satisfies all constraints:\n- G is not in position 3.\n- F (position 4) is to the right of E (position 3).\n- A (position 7) is to the right of G (position 6).\n- D (position 5) is to the right of F (position 4).\n- C (position 1) is to the left of G (position 6).\n- E (position 3) is to the right of B (position 2).\n\nThus, the arrangement of books is:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"B\", \"E\", \"F\", \"D\", \"G\", \"A\"]>>>"
