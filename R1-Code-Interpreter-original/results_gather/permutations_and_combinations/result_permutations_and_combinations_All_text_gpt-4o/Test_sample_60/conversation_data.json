    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book G cannot be placed in position 5.**\n   - G can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Book A cannot be placed in position 6.**\n   - A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n\n3. **Book G must be to the left of book D.**\n   - G must be in a position less than D.\n\n4. **Book A must be to the left of book C.**\n   - A must be in a position less than C.\n\n5. **Book E must be placed in position 6.**\n   - E is fixed at position 6.\n\n6. **Book F must be to the right of book B.**\n   - F must be in a position greater than B.\n\n7. **Book A must be to the left of book G.**\n   - A must be in a position less than G.\n\n8. **Book F must be to the right of book D.**\n   - F must be in a position greater than D.\n\n9. **Book E cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - This is already satisfied since E is in position 6.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books while satisfying all these constraints:\n\n- Since E is in position 6, we have positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 available for the other books.\n- G cannot be in position 5, so G can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7.\n- A cannot be in position 6, so A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n- A must be to the left of G, so A must be in a position less than G.\n- G must be to the left of D, so D must be in a position greater than G.\n- F must be to the right of B, so B must be in a position less than F.\n- F must be to the right of D, so D must be in a position less than F.\n- A must be to the left of C, so A must be in a position less than C.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n1. Place A in position 1 (since A must be to the left of both C and G).\n2. Place G in position 2 (since G must be to the left of D and cannot be in position 5).\n3. Place D in position 3 (since D must be to the right of G and to the left of F).\n4. Place B in position 4 (since B must be to the left of F).\n5. Place F in position 5 (since F must be to the right of both B and D).\n6. E is already in position 6.\n7. Place C in position 7 (since C must be to the right of A).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- G is not in position 5.\n- A is not in position 6.\n- G is to the left of D.\n- A is to the left of C.\n- E is in position 6.\n- F is to the right of B.\n- A is to the left of G.\n- F is to the right of D.\n\nThus, the arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"G\", \"D\", \"B\", \"F\", \"E\", \"C\"]>>>"
