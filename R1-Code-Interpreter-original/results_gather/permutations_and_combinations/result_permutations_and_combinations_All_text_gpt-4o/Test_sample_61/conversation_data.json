    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze each constraint step by step:\n\n1. **Book A must be to the right of book E.**\n2. **Book G must be adjacent to book A.**\n3. **Book B must be placed in position 2.**\n4. **Book E must be to the left of book C.**\n5. **Book C must be to the right of book E.** (This is essentially the same as constraint 4)\n6. **Book E must be to the right of book B.**\n7. **Book D must be adjacent to book G.**\n8. **Book C cannot be placed in position 5.**\n9. **Book A must be placed in position 4.**\n\nLet's start placing the books based on these constraints:\n\n- **Position 2**: Book B is fixed here due to constraint 3.\n- **Position 4**: Book A is fixed here due to constraint 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the placement of other books:\n\n- **Book E** must be to the right of Book B (constraint 6) and to the left of Book A (constraint 1). Therefore, Book E can only be in position 3.\n- **Book C** must be to the right of Book E (constraint 5) and cannot be in position 5 (constraint 8). Therefore, Book C must be in position 6.\n- **Book G** must be adjacent to Book A (constraint 2). Since Book A is in position 4, Book G can be in position 3 or 5. However, position 3 is occupied by Book E, so Book G must be in position 5.\n- **Book D** must be adjacent to Book G (constraint 7). Since Book G is in position 5, Book D can be in position 4 or 6. However, position 4 is occupied by Book A, and position 6 is occupied by Book C, so Book D must be in position 7.\n- The only remaining book is F, which must be placed in the only remaining position, position 1.\n\nThus, the arrangement of the books from left to right is:\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"B\", \"E\", \"A\", \"G\", \"C\", \"D\"]>>>"
