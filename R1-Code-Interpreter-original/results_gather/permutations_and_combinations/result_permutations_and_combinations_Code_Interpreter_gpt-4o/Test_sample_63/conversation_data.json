    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book G cannot be placed in position 7.\n2. Book F must be to the left of book B.\n3. Book B must be to the right of book D.\n4. Book E cannot be placed in position 2.\n5. Book B must be to the right of book G.\n6. Book D cannot be placed in position 7.\n7. Book D must be to the left of book G.\n8. Book F must be placed in position 3.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n- Since Book F must be in position 3, we place F in position 3.\n- Book F must be to the left of Book B, so B cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- Book B must be to the right of Book D, so D must be in position 1 or 2.\n- Book B must be to the right of Book G, so G must be in position 1 or 2.\n- Book D must be to the left of Book G, so D must be in position 1 and G in position 2.\n- Book E cannot be in position 2, so E must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- Book D cannot be in position 7, so D is already in position 1.\n\nLet's try to arrange the books based on these constraints:\n\n1. D\n2. G\n3. F\n4. E\n5. A\n6. B\n7. C\n\nLet's verify if this arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n1. G is not in position 7.\n2. F is to the left of B.\n3. B is to the right of D.\n4. E is not in position 2.\n5. B is to the right of G.\n6. D is not in position 7.\n7. D is to the left of G.\n8. F is in position 3.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"G\", \"F\", \"E\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]>>>"
