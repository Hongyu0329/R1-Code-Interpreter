    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and find a possible arrangement:\n\n1. **Book C must be adjacent to book E.**\n2. **Book B must be placed in position 6.**\n3. **Book A must be to the right of book E.**\n4. **Book E must be to the right of book F.**\n5. **Book A must be to the right of book C.**\n6. **Book G must be to the right of book E.**\n7. **Book F cannot be placed in position 7.**\n8. **Book C must be to the left of book G.**\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n- Since Book B is fixed at position 6, we have positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 available for the other books.\n- Book F must be placed before Book E, and Book E must be adjacent to Book C.\n- Book A must be to the right of both Book E and Book C.\n- Book G must be to the right of Book E and Book C.\n\nLet's try to place the books step by step:\n\n1. Place Book F in position 1 (since it cannot be in position 7 and must be before E).\n2. Place Book E in position 3 (to be adjacent to C and to the right of F).\n3. Place Book C in position 2 (adjacent to E and to the left of G).\n4. Place Book G in position 4 (to the right of E and C).\n5. Place Book A in position 5 (to the right of E and C).\n6. Book B is already in position 6.\n7. Place the remaining Book D in position 7.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n- C and E are adjacent.\n- B is in position 6.\n- A is to the right of E and C.\n- E is to the right of F.\n- G is to the right of E and C.\n- F is not in position 7.\n- C is to the left of G.\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all constraints. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"C\", \"E\", \"G\", \"A\", \"B\", \"D\"]>>>"
