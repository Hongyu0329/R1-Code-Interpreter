    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book A must be to the right of book E.\n2. Book G must be adjacent to book A.\n3. Book B must be placed in position 2.\n4. Book E must be to the left of book C.\n5. Book C must be to the right of book E.\n6. Book E must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book D must be adjacent to book G.\n8. Book C cannot be placed in position 5.\n9. Book A must be placed in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the books:\n\n- Book B is fixed at position 2.\n- Book A is fixed at position 4.\n- Book G must be adjacent to book A, so it can be in position 3 or 5.\n- Book D must be adjacent to book G, so it can be in position 3 or 5, depending on where G is placed.\n- Book E must be to the left of book A and to the right of book B, so it can be in position 3.\n- Book C must be to the right of book E and cannot be in position 5, so it can be in position 6 or 7.\n\nLet's try to place the books in a way that satisfies all constraints:\n\n1. B is in position 2.\n2. A is in position 4.\n3. E is in position 3 (to the right of B and to the left of A).\n4. G is in position 5 (adjacent to A).\n5. D is in position 6 (adjacent to G).\n6. C is in position 7 (to the right of E and not in position 5).\n7. F is the only book left, so it goes in position 1.\n\nThe arrangement is: F, B, E, A, G, D, C.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement satisfies all constraints:\n\n1. A is to the right of E.\n2. G is adjacent to A.\n3. B is in position 2.\n4. E is to the left of C.\n5. C is to the right of E.\n6. E is to the right of B.\n7. D is adjacent to G.\n8. C is not in position 5.\n9. A is in position 4.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"B\", \"E\", \"A\", \"G\", \"D\", \"C\"]>>>"
