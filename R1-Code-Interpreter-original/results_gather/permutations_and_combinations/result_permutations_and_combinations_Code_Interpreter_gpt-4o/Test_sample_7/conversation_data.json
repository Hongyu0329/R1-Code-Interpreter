    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book D must be to the right of book C.\n2. Book F must be to the left of book A.\n3. Book F must be to the left of book B.\n4. Book C cannot be placed in position 4.\n5. Book A cannot be placed in position 3.\n6. Book E cannot be placed in position 3.\n7. Book C cannot be placed in position 2.\n8. Book F must be to the left of book D.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start by placing book F, which has the most constraints related to its position. Book F must be to the left of A, B, and D.
