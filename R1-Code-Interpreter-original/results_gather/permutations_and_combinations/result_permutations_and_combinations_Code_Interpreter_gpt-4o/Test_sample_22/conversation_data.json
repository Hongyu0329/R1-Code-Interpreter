    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book C must be adjacent to book E.**\n2. **Book C must be to the left of book B.**\n3. **Book F must be adjacent to book B.**\n4. **Book B cannot be placed in position 6.**\n5. **Book D must be to the right of book E.**\n6. **Book C must be placed in position 1.**\n7. **Book A must be placed in position 3.**\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- **Position 1:** Book C (from constraint 6)\n- **Position 3:** Book A (from constraint 7)\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining positions and constraints:\n\n- Since Book C is in position 1, Book E must be in position 2 to satisfy constraint 1.\n- Book D must be to the right of Book E, so Book D can be in position 4, 5, or 6.\n- Book B cannot be in position 6, and it must be adjacent to Book F (constraint 3). Therefore, Book B can be in position 4 or 5, and Book F will be adjacent to it.\n- Since Book C must be to the left of Book B (constraint 2), Book B cannot be in position 2.\n\nLet's try placing the books:\n\n- **Position 1:** C\n- **Position 2:** E\n- **Position 3:** A\n- **Position 4:** B\n- **Position 5:** F\n- **Position 6:** D\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- C is adjacent to E.\n- C is to the left of B.\n- F is adjacent to B.\n- B is not in position 6.\n- D is to the right of E.\n- C is in position 1.\n- A is in position 3.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"E\", \"A\", \"B\", \"F\", \"D\"]>>>"
