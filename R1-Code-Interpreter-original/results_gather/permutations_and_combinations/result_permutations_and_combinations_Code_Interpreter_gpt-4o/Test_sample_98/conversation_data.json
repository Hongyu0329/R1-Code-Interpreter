    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and find a valid arrangement:\n\n1.

Book C must be to the left of book G.\n6. Book E must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book A must be placed in position 7.\n\nGiven that book A must be in position 7, we can start by placing A there. Then, we need to ensure that the other constraints are satisfied.
