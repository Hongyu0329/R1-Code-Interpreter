    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book F must be to the left of book E.\n2. Book F must be to the right of book A.\n3. Book F cannot be placed in position 1.\n4. Book A must be placed in position 5.\n5. Book F must be to the right of book C.\n6. Book F must be to the right of book D.\n7. Book C must be to the left of book E.\n8. Book B must be adjacent to book D.\n9. Book C must be placed in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Book A is fixed at position 5.\n- Book C is fixed at position 4.\n- Book F must be to the right of A, C, and D, and to the left of E.\n- Book B must be adjacent to D.\n\nLet's try to place the books in a way that satisfies all these constraints. \n\n1. Position 4 is occupied by C.\n2. Position 5 is occupied by A.\n3. F must be to the right of A, C, and D, so it can be in position 6 or 7.\n4. E must be to the right of F, so it can be in position 7 if F is in position 6.\n5. B and D must be adjacent, so they can be in positions 2 and 3 or 3 and 2.\n6. The only position left for G is position 1.\n\nLet's check if this arrangement satisfies all constraints:\n\n- Position 1: G\n- Position 2: D\n- Position 3: B\n- Position 4: C\n- Position 5: A\n- Position 6: F\n- Position 7: E\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"G\", \"D\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"F\", \"E\"]>>>"
