    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and find a possible arrangement:\n\n1. Book C must be to the left of book D.\n2. Book A must be to the left of book C.\n3. Book F must be placed in position 2.\n4. Book A must be to the right of book E.\n5. Book G cannot be placed in position 6.\n6. Book G cannot be placed in position 2.\n7. Book C must be to the right of book B.\n8. Book G cannot be placed in position 6. (This is a duplicate of constraint 5.)\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n- Since F is in position 2, the arrangement starts with: \\[ \\_, F, \\_, \\_, \\_, \\_, \\_ \\]\n- G cannot be in position 2 or 6, so possible positions for G are 1, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n- A must be to the right of E, so E must be placed before A.\n- C must be to the left of D and to the right of B.\n\nLet's try to fill in the positions step by step:\n\n1. Place F in position 2: \\[ \\_, F, \\_, \\_, \\_, \\_, \\_ \\]\n2. Place E in position 1 (since A must be to the right of E): \\[ E, F, \\_, \\_, \\_, \\_, \\_ \\]\n3. Place A in position 3 (since A must be to the right of E): \\[ E, F, A, \\_, \\_, \\_, \\_ \\]\n4. Place B in position 4 (since C must be to the right of B): \\[ E, F, A, B, \\_, \\_, \\_ \\]\n5. Place C in position 5 (since C must be to the right of B and to the left of D): \\[ E, F, A, B, C, \\_, \\_ \\]\n6. Place D in position 6 (since C must be to the left of D): \\[ E, F, A, B, C, D, \\_ \\]\n7. Place G in position 7 (since G cannot be in position 6 or 2): \\[ E, F, A, B, C, D, G \\]\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"G\"]>>>"
