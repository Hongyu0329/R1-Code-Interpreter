    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book C cannot be placed in position 3.\n2. Book D must be adjacent to book A.\n3. Book A cannot be placed in position 3.\n4. Book F must be to the right of book C.\n5. Book F must be to the right of book A.\n6. Book E must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book F must be placed in position 6.\n\nGiven that Book F must be in position 6, we can start by placing it there. Then, we need to ensure that Book C is to the left of Book F, and Book A is also to the left of Book F. Additionally, Book D must be adjacent to Book A, and Book E must be to the right of Book B.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement that satisfies all these constraints.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Books to arrange\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n\n# Constraint: Book F must be in position 6\n# So, we only need to permute the first 5 positions\nfor perm in permutations(books[:-1]):\n    # Place F in position 6\n    arrangement = list(perm) + ['F']\n    \n    # Check all constraints\n    if (arrangement.index('C') != 2 and  # Book C cannot be in position 3\n        abs(arrangement.index('D') - arrangement.index('A')) == 1 and  # D must be adjacent to A\n        arrangement.index('A') != 2 and  # Book A cannot be in position 3\n        arrangement.index('C') < arrangement.index('F') and  # F must be to the right of C\n        arrangement.index('A') < arrangement.index('F') and  # F must be to the right of A\n        arrangement.index('B') < arrangement.index('E')):  # E must be to the right of B\n        solution = arrangement\n        break\n\nsolution\nassistant > The arrangement of the books that satisfies all the given constraints is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"D\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", \"F\"]>>>"
