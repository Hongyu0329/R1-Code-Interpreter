    "\nassistant > Given the constraints, we can start by placing the books according to the rules:\n\n1. Book B must be placed in position 1.\n2. Book A must be adjacent to book B, so it can be in position 2.\n3. Book C must be to the right of book B, so it can be in position 3 or later.\n4. Book F must be to the right of book B, so it can be in position 3 or later.\n5. Book E must be to the left of book F, so it can be in position 3 or earlier.\n6. Book D cannot be in position 3.\n\nLet's try to arrange the books based on these constraints:\n\n- Place B in position 1.\n- Place A in position 2 (adjacent to B).\n- Place C in position 3 (to the right of B).\n- Place E in position 4 (to the left of F).\n- Place F in position 5 (to the right of B).\n- Place D in position 6 (not in position 3).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"E\", \"F\", \"D\"]>>>"
