    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book F must be adjacent to book D.**\n2. **Book C must be adjacent to book F.**\n3. **Book F cannot be placed in position 1.**\n4. **Book B must be to the right of book G.**\n5. **Book B must be placed in position 3.**\n6. **Book E must be to the left of book C.**\n7. **Book G must be placed in position 2.**\n8. **Book A cannot be placed in position 4.**\n9. **Book A must be to the left of book D.**\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 3** is occupied by **Book B** (Constraint 5).\n- **Position 2** is occupied by **Book G** (Constraint 7).\n- **Book B** is to the right of **Book G** (Constraint 4), which is satisfied by the above placements.\n- **Book F** cannot be in position 1 (Constraint 3).\n- **Book F** must be adjacent to **Book D** and **Book C** must be adjacent to **Book F** (Constraints 1 and 2). This means **F**, **D**, and **C** must be together in some order.\n- **Book E** must be to the left of **Book C** (Constraint 6).\n- **Book A** cannot be in position 4 and must be to the left of **Book D** (Constraints 8 and 9).\n\nLet's try to place the books in a way that satisfies all constraints:\n\n1. **Position 1**: **Book A** (since it cannot be in position 4 and must be to the left of **Book D**).\n2. **Position 2**: **Book G** (as per Constraint 7).\n3. **Position 3**: **Book B** (as per Constraint 5).\n4. **Position 4**: **Book E** (since it must be to the left of **Book C**).\n5. **Position 5**: **Book F** (since it must be adjacent to **Book D** and **Book C**).\n6. **Position 6**: **Book C** (adjacent to **Book F** and to the right of **Book E**).\n7. **Position 7**: **Book D** (adjacent to **Book F** and to the right of **Book A**).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"G\", \"B\", \"E\", \"F\", \"C\", \"D\"]>>>"
