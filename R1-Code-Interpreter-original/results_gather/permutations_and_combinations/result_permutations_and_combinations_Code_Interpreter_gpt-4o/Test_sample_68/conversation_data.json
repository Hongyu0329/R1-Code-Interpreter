    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book D cannot be placed in position 7.\n2. Book A must be to the left of book F.\n3. Book G must be to the left of book F.\n4. Book G must be adjacent to book B.\n5. Book C must be to the left of book G.\n6. Book G must be to the right of book D.\n7. Book E must be to the right of book C.\n8. Book F must be to the right of book C.\n9. Book G must be to the right of book E.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Book C must be to the left of books E, F, and G.\n- Book G must be adjacent to book B.\n- Book G must be to the right of books C, D, and E.\n- Book A must be to the left of book F.\n- Book D cannot be in position 7.\n\nLet's try to arrange the books based on these constraints. \n\n1. Start with C, as it must be to the left of E, F, and G.\n2. Place D next, as G must be to the right of D.\n3. Place E after D, as G must be to the right of E.\n4. Place G next, as it must be adjacent to B and to the right of C, D, and E.\n5. Place B adjacent to G.\n6. Place A next, as it must be to the left of F.\n7. Finally, place F, as it must be to the right of A and C.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement: C, D, E, G, B, A, F.\n\n- C is to the left of E, F, and G.\n- G is adjacent to B.\n- G is to the right of C, D, and E.\n- A is to the left of F.\n- D is not in position 7.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"G\", \"B\", \"A\", \"F\"]>>>"
