    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Book E must be to the left of book C.\n2. Book G cannot be placed in position 6.\n3. Book G must be to the right of book B.\n4. Book A cannot be placed in position 6.\n5. Book G must be to the right of book F.\n6. Book A must be placed in position 7.\n7. Book C must be placed in position 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books that have fixed positions:\n\n- Book A must be placed in position 7.\n- Book C must be placed in position 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining constraints:\n\n- Book E must be to the left of book C, so E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Book G cannot be in position 6, and it must be to the right of both books B and F.\n- Book G must be to the right of book B and book F.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement by placing the remaining books:\n\n1. Place book C in position 5.\n2. Place book A in position 7.\n3. Place book E in position 1 (to ensure it is to the left of C).\n4. Place book B in position 2.\n5. Place book F in position 3.\n6. Place book G in position 6 (since it cannot be in position 6, it must be in position 4).\n7. Place book D in position 6.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n- E is to the left of C.\n- G is not in position 6.\n- G is to the right of B and F.\n- A is in position 7.\n- C is in position 5.\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the valid arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"E\", \"B\", \"F\", \"G\", \"C\", \"D\", \"A\"]>>>"
