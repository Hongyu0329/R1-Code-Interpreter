    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book A must be to the right of book B.**\n2. **Book F must be to the right of book G.**\n3. **Book D must be adjacent to book E.**\n4. **Book F cannot be placed in position 4.**\n5. **Book E must be to the left of book A.**\n6. **Book C cannot be placed in position 4.**\n7. **Book B must be to the left of book G.**\n8. **Book C must be to the right of book F.**\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement that satisfies all these constraints.
