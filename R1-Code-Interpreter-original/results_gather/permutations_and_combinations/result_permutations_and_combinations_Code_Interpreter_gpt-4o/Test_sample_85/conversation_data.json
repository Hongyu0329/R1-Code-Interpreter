    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book E must be to the left of book D.**\n2. **Book G must be to the right of book A.**\n3. **Book E must be to the left of book C.**\n4. **Book F cannot be placed in position 7.**\n5. **Book C must be placed in position 6.** (This is a fixed position for C)\n6. **Book E must be placed in position 2.** (This is a fixed position for E)\n7. **Book B must be adjacent to book G.**\n8. **Book A must be to the left of book F.**\n9. **Book F must be adjacent to book G.**\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- **Position 2** is fixed for **E**.\n- **Position 6** is fixed for **C**.\n- **A** must be to the left of **G** and **F**.\n- **F** must be adjacent to **G**.\n- **B** must be adjacent to **G**.\n\nLet's try to place the books in a way that satisfies all these constraints.
