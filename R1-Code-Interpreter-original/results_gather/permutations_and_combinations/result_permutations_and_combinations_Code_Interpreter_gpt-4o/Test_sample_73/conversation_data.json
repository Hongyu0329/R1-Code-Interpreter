    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book C cannot be placed in position 4.**\n2. **Book C must be placed in position 5.**  \n   - This overrides the first constraint, so Book C is in position 5.\n\n3. **Book A cannot be placed in position 5.**  \n   - This is already satisfied since Book C is in position 5.\n\n4. **Book D must be adjacent to book F.**  \n   - Book D and F must be next to each other.\n\n5. **Book F must be to the left of book B.**\n6. **Book G must be to the right of book B.**\n7. **Book F must be to the left of book G.**  \n   - From these constraints, the order of F, B, and G must be F < B < G.\n\n8. **Book E must be placed in position 4.**  \n   - This is a fixed position for Book E.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Position 4 is occupied by Book E.\n- Position 5 is occupied by Book C.\n- Book D and F must be adjacent, and F must be to the left of B, which must be to the left of G.\n- The only positions left for D, F, B, and G are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.\n\nLet's try to place D, F, B, and G in the remaining positions while satisfying all constraints. We'll start by placing F and D adjacent to each other, and then place B and G accordingly.\n\nLet's find a valid arrangement.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Books to arrange\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'D', 'F', 'G']\n\n# Fixed positions\nfixed_positions = {4: 'E', 5: 'C'}\n\n# Constraints:\n# 1.
