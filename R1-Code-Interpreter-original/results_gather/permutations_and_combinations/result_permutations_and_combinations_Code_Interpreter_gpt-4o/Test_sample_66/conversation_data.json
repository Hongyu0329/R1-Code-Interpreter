    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book G cannot be placed in position 3.**\n2. **Book C must be to the left of book B.**\n3. **Book B must be adjacent to book D.**\n4. **Book G must be adjacent to book D.**\n5. **Book D cannot be placed in position 7.**\n6. **Book C must be to the left of book G.**\n7. **Book G must be adjacent to book C.**\n8. **Book B must be adjacent to book E.**\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following:\n\n- **Constraints 3 and 4** imply that B, D, and G must be in a sequence like B-D-G or G-D-B.\n- **Constraints 6 and 7** imply that C must be adjacent to G and to the left of G, so the sequence must be C-G.\n- **Constraint 8** implies that B must be adjacent to E, so the sequence must be B-E.\n\nLet's try to arrange these sequences while respecting all constraints:\n\n1. **C-G** (from constraints 6 and 7)\n2. **G-D** (from constraint 4)\n3. **B-D** (from constraint 3)\n4. **B-E** (from constraint 8)\n\nCombining these, we can try the sequence: C-G-D-B-E. Now, we need to place A and F in the remaining positions.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Books to arrange\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\n# Constraints\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Constraint 1: Book G cannot be in position 3\n    if arrangement.index('G') == 2:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 2: Book C must be to the left of book B\n    if arrangement.index('C') > arrangement.index('B'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 3: Book B must be adjacent to book D\n    if abs(arrangement.index('B') - arrangement.index('D')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 4: Book G must be adjacent to book D\n    if abs(arrangement.index('G') - arrangement.index('D')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 5: Book D cannot be in position 7\n    if arrangement.index('D') == 6:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 6: Book C must be to the left of book G\n    if arrangement.index('C') > arrangement.index('G'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 7: Book G must be adjacent to book C\n    if abs(arrangement.index('G') - arrangement.index('C')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 8: Book B must be adjacent to book E\n    if abs(arrangement.index('B') - arrangement.index('E')) != 1:\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Find a valid arrangement\nfor arrangement in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(arrangement):\n        valid_arrangement = arrangement\n        break\n\nvalid_arrangement\nassistant > The valid arrangement of the books from left to right on the bookshelf, satisfying all the given constraints, is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"F\", \"C\", \"G\", \"D\", \"B\", \"E\"]>>>"
