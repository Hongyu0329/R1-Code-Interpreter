    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book C cannot be placed in position 5.\n2. Book F must be adjacent to book D.\n3. Book G must be adjacent to book C.\n4. Book E must be to the right of book G.\n5. Book F must be to the right of book B.\n6. Book F must be placed in position 7.\n7. Book G must be to the left of book D.\n8. Book D must be adjacent to book F.\n9. Book E must be to the left of book D.\n\nGiven that Book F must be in position 7, Book D must be in position 6 to satisfy the adjacency constraint (2 and 8). \n\nNow, let's try to place the other books while satisfying all constraints:\n\n- Since F is in position 7, B must be to the left of F (constraint 5), so B can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n- G must be to the left of D (constraint 7) and adjacent to C (constraint 3). \n- E must be to the right of G (constraint 4) and to the left of D (constraint 9).\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement by placing the books step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Books to arrange\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\n# Constraints\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Constraint 1: Book C cannot be in position 5\n    if arrangement.index('C') == 4:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 2: Book F must be adjacent to book D\n    if abs(arrangement.index('F') - arrangement.index('D')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 3: Book G must be adjacent to book C\n    if abs(arrangement.index('G') - arrangement.index('C')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 4: Book E must be to the right of book G\n    if arrangement.index('E') < arrangement.index('G'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 5: Book F must be to the right of book B\n    if arrangement.index('F') < arrangement.index('B'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 6: Book F must be in position 7\n    if arrangement.index('F') != 6:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 7: Book G must be to the left of book D\n    if arrangement.index('G') > arrangement.index('D'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 8: Book D must be adjacent to book F (already checked in constraint 2)\n    # Constraint 9: Book E must be to the left of book D\n    if arrangement.index('E') > arrangement.index('D'):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Find a valid arrangement\nvalid_arrangement = None\nfor perm in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(perm):\n        valid_arrangement = perm\n        break\n\nvalid_arrangement\nassistant > The valid arrangement of the books from left to right on the bookshelf, satisfying all the given constraints, is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"G\", \"E\", \"D\", \"F\"]>>>"
