    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book C must be to the right of book D.**\n   - Since book C is in position 6, book D must be in one of the positions 1 to 5.\n\n2. **Book F must be adjacent to book A.**\n   - Book F and A must be next to each other.\n\n3. **Book F must be to the left of book C.**\n   - Since book C is in position 6, book F must be in one of the positions 1 to 5.\n\n4. **Book G must be to the right of book A.**\n   - Book G must be placed after book A.\n\n5. **Book G must be to the left of book E.**\n   - Book G must be placed before book E.\n\n6. **Book B must be placed in position 3.**\n   - Book B is fixed in position 3.\n\n7. **Book D cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - Book D must be in one of the positions 1 to 6.\n\n8. **Book C must be placed in position 6.**\n   - Book C is fixed in position 6.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement for the books.
