    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in finding a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Book F cannot be placed in position 2.\n2. Book F must be placed in position 4.\n3. Book D must be to the right of book A.\n4. Book B must be to the left of book G.\n5. Book D must be to the right of book G.\n6. Book F must be to the left of book G.\n7. Book G must be to the left of book D.\n8. Book A must be to the left of book E.\n9. Book G must be to the left of book C.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following:\n- Since F must be in position 4, we can place it there directly.\n- G must be to the left of D, and also to the left of C.\n- A must be to the left of D and E.\n- B must be to the left of G.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement by placing F in position 4 and then arranging the other books around it.\n\nWe'll use a brute-force approach to try different permutations of the books in the remaining positions and check if they satisfy all the constraints.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Books to arrange\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'G']\n\n# Fixed position for F\nfixed_position = 4\nfixed_book = 'F'\n\n# Function to check if a given arrangement satisfies all constraints\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Insert F at the fixed position\n    arrangement = arrangement[:fixed_position-1] + [fixed_book] + arrangement[fixed_position-1:]\n    \n    # Extract positions of each book\n    pos = {book: arrangement.index(book) + 1 for book in arrangement}\n    \n    # Check constraints\n    if pos['D'] <= pos['A']:\n        return False\n    if pos['B'] >= pos['G']:\n        return False\n    if pos['D'] <= pos['G']:\n        return False\n    if pos['F'] >= pos['G']:\n        return False\n    if pos['G'] >= pos['D']:\n        return False\n    if pos['A'] >= pos['E']:\n        return False\n    if pos['G'] >= pos['C']:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try all permutations of the remaining books\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(list(perm)):\n        # Insert F at the fixed position\n        result = list(perm[:fixed_position-1]) + [fixed_book] + list(perm[fixed_position-1:])\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the books A, B, C, D, E, and G, insert F at position 4, and check if the arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Once a valid arrangement is found, it will print the result.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid arrangement of the books that satisfies all the given constraints. The arrangement is:\n\n- A is to the left of D and E.\n- B is to the left of G.\n- D is to the right of A and G.\n- F is in position 4.\n- F is to the left of G.\n- G is to the left of D and C.\n\nThe final arrangement of the books on the shelf is:\n\n<<<['A', 'B', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'C', 'D']>>>"
