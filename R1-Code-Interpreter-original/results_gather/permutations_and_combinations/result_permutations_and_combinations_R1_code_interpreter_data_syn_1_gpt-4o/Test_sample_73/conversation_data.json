    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book C cannot be placed in position 4.\n2. Book C must be placed in position 5. (This overrides constraint 1, so C is in position 5.)\n3. Book A cannot be placed in position 5. (This is already satisfied since C is in position 5.)\n4. Book D must be adjacent to book F.\n5. Book F must be to the left of book B.\n6. Book G must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book F must be to the left of book G.\n8. Book E must be placed in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Place C in position 5.\n- Place E in position 4.\n- Since D must be adjacent to F, and F must be to the left of B, and G must be to the right of B, we can try placing F in position 3 and D in position 2.\n- Now, B must be to the right of F, so B can be placed in position 6.\n- G must be to the right of B, so G can be placed in position 7.\n- Finally, A is the only book left, and it can be placed in position 1.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement with the constraints:\n\n- C is in position 5.\n- E is in position 4.\n- D is adjacent to F (D is in position 2, F is in position 3).\n- F is to the left of B (F is in position 3, B is in position 6).\n- G is to the right of B (B is in position 6, G is in position 7).\n- F is to the left of G (F is in position 3, G is in position 7).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Let's write the final answer:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"D\", \"F\", \"E\", \"C\", \"B\", \"G\"]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Xiao Wang is a librarian responsible for shelving 7 books labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.
