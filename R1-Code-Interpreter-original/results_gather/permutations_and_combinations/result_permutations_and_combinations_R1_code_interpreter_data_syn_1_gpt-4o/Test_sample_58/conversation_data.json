    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book F must be adjacent to book D.\n2. Book C must be adjacent to book F.\n3. Book F cannot be placed in position 1.\n4. Book B must be to the right of book G.\n5. Book B must be placed in position 3.\n6. Book E must be to the left of book C.\n7. Book G must be placed in position 2.\n8. Book A cannot be placed in position 4.\n9. Book A must be to the left of book D.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books that have fixed positions:\n\n- Book B is in position 3.\n- Book G is in position 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the adjacency constraints:\n\n- Since F must be adjacent to D and C must be adjacent to F, the possible sequences for these three books are: DFC, FDC, CFD, CDF, DCF, FCD.\n\nLet's try to place these books around the fixed positions of B and G:\n\n- Since B is in position 3, F cannot be in position 1, and G is in position 2, F can be in position 4 or 5.\n- If F is in position 4, then D can be in position 5 and C in position 6, or D in position 3 and C in position 5.\n- If F is in position 5, then D can be in position 4 and C in position 6, or D in position 6 and C in position 4.\n\nLet's also consider the constraints involving A and E:\n\n- A must be to the left of D, and A cannot be in position 4.\n- E must be to the left of C.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement by considering these constraints:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Books to arrange\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\n# Fixed positions\nfixed_positions = {'B': 3, 'G': 2}\n\n# Constraints\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Check fixed positions\n    if arrangement[1] != 'G' or arrangement[2] != 'B':\n        return False\n    # F must be adjacent to D\n    if not (abs(arrangement.index('F') - arrangement.index('D')) == 1):\n        return False\n    # C must be adjacent to F\n    if not (abs(arrangement.index('C') - arrangement.index('F')) == 1):\n        return False\n    # F cannot be in position 1\n    if arrangement[0] == 'F':\n        return False\n    # E must be to the left of C\n    if arrangement.index('E') > arrangement.index('C'):\n        return False\n    # A cannot be in position 4\n    if arrangement[3] == 'A':\n        return False\n    # A must be to the left of D\n    if arrangement.index('A') > arrangement.index('D'):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all permutations and check constraints\nfor perm in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid arrangement of the books.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid arrangement of the books that satisfies all the given constraints. Let's verify the solution:\n\n1. Book F is adjacent to book D.\n2. Book C is adjacent to book F.\n3. Book F is not in position 1.\n4. Book B is to the right of book G.\n5. Book B is in position 3.\n6. Book E is to the left of book C.\n7. Book G is in position 2.\n8. Book A is not in position 4.\n9. Book A is to the left of book D.\n\nThe arrangement `['A', 'G', 'B', 'E', 'C', 'F', 'D']` satisfies all these constraints.\n\n<<<['A', 'G', 'B', 'E', 'C', 'F', 'D']>>>"
