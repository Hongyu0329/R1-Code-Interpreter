    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and use them to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Book G cannot be placed in position 5.\n2. Book A cannot be placed in position 6.\n3. Book G must be to the left of book D.\n4. Book A must be to the left of book C.\n5. Book E must be placed in position 6.\n6. Book F must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book A must be to the left of book G.\n8. Book F must be to the right of book D.\n9. Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following:\n- Since Book E must be in position 6, we can place it there immediately.\n- Book G cannot be in position 5, and it must be to the left of D, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Book A cannot be in position 6 and must be to the left of both C and G, so it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Book F must be to the right of both B and D, so it can be in positions 5 or 7.\n- Book E cannot be in position 7, so it is already in position 6.\n\nLet's use these deductions to find a valid arrangement by trying different combinations and checking if they satisfy all constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\n# E is fixed at position 6\nfixed_positions = {5: 'E'}\n\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Check all constraints\n    if arrangement[4] != 'E':  # E must be at position 6 (index 5)\n        return False\n    if arrangement[6] == 'E':  # E cannot be at position 7\n        return False\n    if arrangement[4] == 'G':  # G cannot be at position 5\n        return False\n    if arrangement[5] == 'A':  # A cannot be at position 6\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('G') > arrangement.index('D'):  # G must be to the left of D\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('A') > arrangement.index('C'):  # A must be to the left of C\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('A') > arrangement.index('G'):  # A must be to the left of G\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('F') < arrangement.index('B'):  # F must be to the right of B\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('F') < arrangement.index('D'):  # F must be to the right of D\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all permutations of the books\nfor perm in permutations(books):\n    # Apply fixed positions\n    perm = list(perm)\n    for pos, book in fixed_positions.items():\n        if perm[pos] != book:\n            break\n    else:\n        # Check if the current permutation is valid\n        if is_valid(perm):\n            print(perm)\n            break\n```\n\nThe code will generate all permutations of the books, apply the fixed position for book E, and check each permutation against the constraints. Once a valid arrangement is found, it will be printed."
