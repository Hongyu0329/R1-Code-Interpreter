    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Book D must be adjacent to book F.\n2. Book F must be to the right of book D.\n3. Book B must be to the right of book G.\n4. Book E must be placed in position 4.\n5. Book B cannot be placed in position 2.\n6. Book D must be to the right of book E.\n7. Book A must be adjacent to book C.\n8. Book F must be to the right of book A.\n9. Book F must be to the right of book D.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following:\n- Since E is in position 4, D must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n- F must be adjacent to D and to the right of D, so F must be in position 6 or 7 if D is in position 5, or F must be in position 7 if D is in position 6.\n- B must be to the right of G, so G cannot be in position 7.\n- A must be adjacent to C, so they must be in consecutive positions.\n- F must be to the right of A, so A cannot be in position 6 or 7.\n- B cannot be in position 2.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement using these constraints. We will use a brute-force approach to check all possible permutations of the books and see which one satisfies all the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Check all constraints\n    if arrangement[3] != 'E':  # E must be in position 4\n        return False\n    if 'D' not in arrangement or 'F' not in arrangement:\n        return False\n    if abs(arrangement.index('D') - arrangement.index('F')) != 1:  # D and F must be adjacent\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('F') < arrangement.index('D'):  # F must be to the right of D\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('B') < arrangement.index('G'):  # B must be to the right of G\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('B') == 1:  # B cannot be in position 2\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('D') < arrangement.index('E'):  # D must be to the right of E\n        return False\n    if abs(arrangement.index('A') - arrangement.index('C')) != 1:  # A and C must be adjacent\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('F') < arrangement.index('A'):  # F must be to the right of A\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Check all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid arrangement of the books.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid arrangement of the books that satisfies all the given constraints. The arrangement is:\n\n<<<['A', 'C', 'G', 'E', 'B', 'D', 'F']>>>"
