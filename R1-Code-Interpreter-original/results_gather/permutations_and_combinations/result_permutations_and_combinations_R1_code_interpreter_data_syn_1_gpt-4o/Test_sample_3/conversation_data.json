    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints:\n\n1. B must be to the right of D.\n2. E must be to the left of B.\n3. F must be to the left of D.\n4. A must be to the right of D.\n5. D must be to the left of A.\n6. B must be to the right of A.\n7. B must be to the right of E.\n8. D must be to the right of F.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following order:\n- F must be to the left of D (from constraint 3 and 8).\n- D must be to the left of A (from constraint 4 and 5).\n- A must be to the left of B (from constraint 6).\n- E must be to the left of B (from constraint 2 and 7).\n\nThus, the order of the books should be: F, D, A, E, B, C.\n\nLet's verify this order with the constraints:\n- B is to the right of D (B is in position 5, D is in position 2).\n- E is to the left of B (E is in position 4, B is in position 5).\n- F is to the left of D (F is in position 1, D is in position 2).\n- A is to the right of D (A is in position 3, D is in position 2).\n- D is to the left of A (D is in position 2, A is in position 3).\n- B is to the right of A (B is in position 5, A is in position 3).\n- B is to the right of E (B is in position 5, E is in position 4).\n- D is to the right of F (D is in position 2, F is in position 1).\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with this order. Therefore, the correct arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"D\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"C\"]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
