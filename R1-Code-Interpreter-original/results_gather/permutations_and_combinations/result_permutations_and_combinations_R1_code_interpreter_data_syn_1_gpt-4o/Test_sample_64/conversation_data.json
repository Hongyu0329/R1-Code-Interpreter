    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Book D must be adjacent to book F.\n2. Book A must be to the left of book D.\n3. Book F must be adjacent to book A.\n4. Book G must be placed in position 7.\n5. Book F cannot be placed in position 1.\n6. Book C must be to the right of book A.\n7. Book E cannot be placed in position 4.\n8. Book A must be to the left of book G.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since F must be adjacent to both A and D, the possible sequences for A, F, and D are: AFD or FDA.\n- Since G is in position 7, A must be placed before position 7.\n- Since F cannot be in position 1, A cannot be in position 1 if AFD is the sequence.\n- C must be to the right of A, so C cannot be in a position before A.\n- E cannot be in position 4.\n\nLet's try to find a valid sequence by considering these constraints. We will use a brute-force approach to check all possible permutations of the books and see which one satisfies all the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Check all constraints\n    if arrangement[6] != 'G':  # G must be in position 7\n        return False\n    if 'D' not in [arrangement[i] for i in range(6) if arrangement[i] == 'F' and i < 6]:  # D must be adjacent to F\n        return False\n    if 'A' not in [arrangement[i] for i in range(6) if arrangement[i] == 'F' and i > 0]:  # F must be adjacent to A\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('A') > arrangement.index('D'):  # A must be to the left of D\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('A') > arrangement.index('C'):  # A must be to the left of C\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('A') > arrangement.index('G'):  # A must be to the left of G\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('F') == 0:  # F cannot be in position 1\n        return False\n    if arrangement.index('E') == 3:  # E cannot be in position 4\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Find a valid arrangement\nfor perm in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid arrangement of the books."
