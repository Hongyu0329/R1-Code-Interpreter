    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book F must be to the left of book E.\n2. Book F must be to the right of book A.\n3. Book F cannot be placed in position 1.\n4. Book A must be placed in position 5.\n5. Book F must be to the right of book C.\n6. Book F must be to the right of book D.\n7. Book C must be to the left of book E.\n8. Book B must be adjacent to book D.\n9. Book C must be placed in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Book A is fixed at position 5.\n- Book C is fixed at position 4.\n- Book F must be to the right of A, C, and D, and to the left of E. Therefore, F can only be in position 6.\n- Book E must be to the right of F, so E must be in position 7.\n- Book D must be to the left of F, so D can be in position 3.\n- Book B must be adjacent to D, so B can be in position 2.\n- The only remaining position is 1, which must be occupied by the remaining book, G.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n- Books:    G, B, D, C, A, F, E\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n- F is to the left of E.\n- F is to the right of A, C, and D.\n- F is not in position 1.\n- A is in position 5.\n- C is in position 4.\n- B is adjacent to D.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer:\n\n<<<[\"G\", \"B\", \"D\", \"C\", \"A\", \"F\", \"E\"]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Xiao Wang is a librarian responsible for shelving 7 books labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.
