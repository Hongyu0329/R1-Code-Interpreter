    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. **E must be to the left of F**: This means E should appear before F in the sequence.\n2. **G must be to the left of A**: This means G should appear before A in the sequence.\n3. **E must be adjacent to B**: E and B should be next to each other.\n4. **D cannot be in position 7**: D should be placed in positions 1 to 6.\n5. **D must be adjacent to C**: D and C should be next to each other.\n6. **G cannot be in position 1**: G should be placed in positions 2 to 7.\n7. **D must be to the right of C**: C should appear before D in the sequence.\n8. **B cannot be in position 7**: B should be placed in positions 1 to 6.\n9. **A must be to the right of G**: A should appear after G in the sequence.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement by considering the adjacency and order requirements. We can use a systematic approach to test possible arrangements.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid arrangement:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Books to arrange\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\n# Constraints\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Constraint 1: E must be to the left of F\n    if arrangement.index('E') > arrangement.index('F'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 2: G must be to the left of A\n    if arrangement.index('G') > arrangement.index('A'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 3: E must be adjacent to B\n    if abs(arrangement.index('E') - arrangement.index('B')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 4: D cannot be in position 7\n    if arrangement.index('D') == 6:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 5: D must be adjacent to C\n    if abs(arrangement.index('D') - arrangement.index('C')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 6: G cannot be in position 1\n    if arrangement.index('G') == 0:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 7: D must be to the right of C\n    if arrangement.index('D') < arrangement.index('C'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 8: B cannot be in position 7\n    if arrangement.index('B') == 6:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 9: A must be to the right of G\n    if arrangement.index('A') < arrangement.index('G'):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all permutations of the books\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will generate all possible permutations of the books and check each one against the constraints. Once it finds a valid arrangement, it will print it and stop. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid arrangement of the books that satisfies all the given constraints. Let's verify the solution:\n\n1. **E is to the left of F**: E is at position 2, and F is at position 5.\n2. **G is to the left of A**: G is at position 6, and A is at position 7.\n3. **E is adjacent to B**: E is at position 2, and B is at position 1.\n4. **D is not in position 7**: D is at position 4.\n5. **D is adjacent to C**: D is at position 4, and C is at position 3.\n6. **G is not in position 1**: G is at position 6.\n7. **D is to the right of C**: D is at position 4, and C is at position 3.\n8. **B is not in position 7**: B is at position 1.\n9. **A is to the right of G**: A is at position 7, and G is at position 6.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with the arrangement `['B', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'G', 'A']`.\n\n<<<['B', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'G', 'A']>>>"
