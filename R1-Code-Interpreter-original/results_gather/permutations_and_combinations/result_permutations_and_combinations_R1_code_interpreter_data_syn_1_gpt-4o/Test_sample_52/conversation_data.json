    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Book B cannot be placed in position 5.\n2. Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n3. Book A must be adjacent to book B.\n4. Book G must be to the left of book D.\n5. Book E must be to the right of book G.\n6. Book G must be to the left of book C.\n7. Book C cannot be placed in position 3.\n8. Book D must be placed in position 5.\n9. Book B must be to the right of book E.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start by placing book D in position 5, as it is the only fixed position. Then, we need to ensure that G is to the left of D, and E is to the right of G. Also, B must be to the right of E, and A must be adjacent to B. Finally, C cannot be in position 3, and G must be to the left of C.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement by considering these constraints:\n\n- Place D in position 5.\n- G must be to the left of D, so G can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- E must be to the right of G, so E can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- B must be to the right of E, so B can be in positions 3, 4, 6, or 7.\n- A must be adjacent to B, so A can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- G must be to the left of C, so C can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.\n- C cannot be in position 3.\n\nLet's use a systematic approach to find a valid arrangement by writing a Python script to check all possible permutations of the books and see which one satisfies all the constraints.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nbooks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n\ndef is_valid(arrangement):\n    # Constraint 1: Book B cannot be placed in position 5.\n    if arrangement[4] == 'B':\n        return False\n    # Constraint 2: Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n    if arrangement[6] == 'E':\n        return False\n    # Constraint 3: Book A must be adjacent to book B.\n    if abs(arrangement.index('A') - arrangement.index('B')) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Constraint 4: Book G must be to the left of book D.\n    if arrangement.index('G') > arrangement.index('D'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 5: Book E must be to the right of book G.\n    if arrangement.index('E') < arrangement.index('G'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 6: Book G must be to the left of book C.\n    if arrangement.index('G') > arrangement.index('C'):\n        return False\n    # Constraint 7: Book C cannot be placed in position 3.\n    if arrangement[2] == 'C':\n        return False\n    # Constraint 8: Book D must be placed in position 5.\n    if arrangement[4] != 'D':\n        return False\n    # Constraint 9: Book B must be to the right of book E.\n    if arrangement.index('B') < arrangement.index('E'):\n        return False\n    return True\n\nfor perm in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will check all permutations of the books and print the first valid arrangement that satisfies all the constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid arrangement of the books that satisfies all the given constraints. The arrangement is:\n\n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: G\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: C\n- Position 5: D\n- Position 6: A\n- Position 7: B\n\nThis arrangement meets all the specified conditions:\n\n1. Book B is not in position 5.\n2. Book E is not in position 7.\n3. Book A is adjacent to book B.\n4. Book G is to the left of book D.\n5. Book E is to the right of book G.\n6. Book G is to the left of book C.\n7. Book C is not in position 3.\n8. Book D is in position 5.\n9. Book B is to the right of book E.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['F', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']>>>"
