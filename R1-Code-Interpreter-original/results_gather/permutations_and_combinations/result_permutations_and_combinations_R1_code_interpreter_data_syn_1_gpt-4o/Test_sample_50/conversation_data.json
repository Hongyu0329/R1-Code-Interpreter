    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book G cannot be placed in position 1.\n2. Book D must be to the left of book C.\n3. Book B must be to the right of book G.\n4. Book C must be placed in position 7.\n5. Book E must be adjacent to book A.\n6. Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n7. Book A must be placed in position 1.\n8. Book G must be to the right of book D.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- From constraint 7, we know Book A is in position 1.\n- From constraint 4, we know Book C is in position 7.\n- From constraint 5, Book E must be adjacent to Book A, so Book E must be in position 2.\n- From constraint 6, Book E cannot be in position 7, which is already satisfied since Book C is in position 7.\n- From constraint 2, Book D must be to the left of Book C, so Book D can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n- From constraint 8, Book G must be to the right of Book D, so Book G can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.\n- From constraint 3, Book B must be to the right of Book G, so Book B can be in positions 5 or 6.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining books (D, G, B, F) in positions 3, 4, 5, and 6, keeping all constraints in mind. We will use a systematic approach to find a valid arrangement.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Fixed positions based on constraints\nbooks = ['A', 'E', None, None, None, None, 'C']\n\n# Possible books for positions 3, 4, 5, 6\nremaining_books = ['D', 'G', 'B', 'F']\n\n# Check all permutations of the remaining books\nfor perm in permutations(remaining_books):\n    # Place the permutation in the available slots\n    books[2], books[3], books[4], books[5] = perm\n    \n    # Check all constraints\n    if books.index('D') < books.index('C') and \\\n       books.index('G') > books.index('D') and \\\n       books.index('B') > books.index('G'):\n        print(books)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid arrangement.",
    "The code execution has provided a valid arrangement of the books on the shelf that satisfies all the given constraints. Let's verify the solution:\n\n1. Book G is not in position 1.\n2. Book D is to the left of Book C.\n3. Book B is to the right of Book G.\n4. Book C is in position 7.\n5. Book E is adjacent to Book A.\n6. Book E is not in position 7.\n7. Book A is in position 1.\n8. Book G is to the right of Book D.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with the arrangement `['A', 'E', 'D', 'G', 'B', 'F', 'C']`.\n\n<<<['A', 'E', 'D', 'G', 'B', 'F', 'C']>>>"
