    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, and F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in arranging the books:\n\n1. Book D must be to the left of book C.\n2. Book B must be placed in position 2.\n3. Book F cannot be placed in position 5.\n4. Book E must be to the right of book A.\n5. Book F must be adjacent to book B.\n6. Book D must be to the left of book F.\n7. Book F must be to the left of book E.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's analyze the possible positions for each book:\n\n- Since B is fixed at position 2, F must be either at position 1 or 3 to be adjacent to B.\n- If F is at position 1, then D must be at position 1 as well, which is not possible. So, F must be at position 3.\n- With F at position 3, D must be at position 1 or 2. Since B is at position 2, D must be at position 1.\n- With D at position 1, C must be at position 4, 5, or 6. But since F is at position 3, C must be at position 4.\n- A must be to the left of E, so A can be at position 5 and E at position 6.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement with the constraints:\n- D is to the left of C (D at 1, C at 4).\n- B is at position 2.\n- F is not at position 5 (F at 3).\n- E is to the right of A (A at 5, E at 6).\n- F is adjacent to B (F at 3, B at 2).\n- D is to the left of F (D at 1, F at 3).\n- F is to the left of E (F at 3, E at 6).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Let's write the final answer:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"B\", \"F\", \"C\", \"A\", \"E\"]>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Xiao Wang is a librarian responsible for shelving 6 books labeled A, B, C, D, E, F on a shelf with positions 1 to 6.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.
