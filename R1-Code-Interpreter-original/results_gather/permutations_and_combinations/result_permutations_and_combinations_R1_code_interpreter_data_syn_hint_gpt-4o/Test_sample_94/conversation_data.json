    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book G cannot be placed in position 1.\n2. Book E must be to the left of book G.\n3. Book A must be adjacent to book G.\n4. Book C cannot be placed in position 5.\n5. Book D must be placed in position 1.\n6. Book A must be adjacent to book E.\n7. Book G must be adjacent to book A.\n8. Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n9. Book G must be to the left of book B.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books:\n\n- Book D is fixed at position 1 due to constraint 5.\n- Book G cannot be in position 1 (constraint 1), so it must be in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- Book E must be to the left of G (constraint 2), so E must be in one of the positions before G.\n- Book A must be adjacent to G (constraint 3 and 7), so A must be either immediately before or after G.\n- Book A must also be adjacent to E (constraint 6), so A must be between E and G or E must be between A and G.\n- Book G must be to the left of B (constraint 9), so B must be in one of the positions after G.\n- Book C cannot be in position 5 (constraint 4).\n- Book E cannot be in position 7 (constraint 8).\n\nLet's try to place the books step by step:\n\n1. Place D in position 1.\n2. Since G cannot be in position 1, and E must be to the left of G, let's try placing E in position 2.\n3. A must be adjacent to both E and G, so let's try placing A in position 3.\n4. G must be adjacent to A, so place G in position 4.\n5. B must be to the right of G, so place B in position 5.\n6. C cannot be in position 5, so place C in position 6.\n7. The only remaining position for F is position 7.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n- D is in position 1.\n- E is to the left of G.\n- A is adjacent to both E and G.\n- G is to the left of B.\n- C is not in position 5.\n- E is not in position 7.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"E\", \"A\", \"G\", \"B\", \"C\", \"F\"]>>>"
