    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in arranging the books:\n\n1. Book G cannot be placed in position 5.\n2. Book A cannot be placed in position 6.\n3. Book G must be to the left of book D.\n4. Book A must be to the left of book C.\n5. Book E must be placed in position 6.\n6. Book F must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book A must be to the left of book G.\n8. Book F must be to the right of book D.\n9. Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Book E must be in position 6, we can place it there directly.\n- Book G cannot be in position 5, and it must be to the left of D. Also, A must be to the left of G, and A cannot be in position 6. Therefore, A must be placed before G, and G must be placed before D.\n- Book F must be to the right of both B and D.\n- Book E is already in position 6, so it cannot be in position 7, which is consistent with constraint 9.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement by considering these constraints:\n\n1. Place E in position 6.\n2. Place A in position 1 (since it must be to the left of both G and C).\n3. Place G in position 2 (since it must be to the left of D).\n4. Place D in position 3 (since it must be to the left of F).\n5. Place B in position 4 (since F must be to the right of B).\n6. Place F in position 5 (since it must be to the right of both B and D).\n7. Place C in position 7 (since A must be to the left of C).\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n- A is in position 1, G is in position 2, D is in position 3, B is in position 4, F is in position 5, E is in position 6, and C is in position 7.\n- All constraints are satisfied with this arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"G\", \"D\", \"B\", \"F\", \"E\", \"C\"]>>>"
