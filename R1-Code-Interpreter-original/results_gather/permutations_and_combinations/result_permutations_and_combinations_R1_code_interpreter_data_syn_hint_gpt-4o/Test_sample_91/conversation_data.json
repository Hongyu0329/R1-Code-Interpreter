    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in placing the books:\n\n1. Book F cannot be placed in position 7.\n2. Book G must be to the left of book D.\n3. Book E cannot be placed in position 1.\n4. Book E must be adjacent to book C.\n5. Book F must be to the left of book C.\n6. Book D must be adjacent to book F.\n7. Book D must be placed in position 4.\n8. Book A must be placed in position 2.\n9. Book C must be to the right of book B.\n\nLet's start by placing the books that have fixed positions:\n\n- Book D is in position 4.\n- Book A is in position 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the adjacency and order constraints:\n\n- Since D is in position 4, F must be in position 3 or 5 (adjacent to D).\n- G must be to the left of D, so G can be in position 1 or 3.\n- E must be adjacent to C, and C must be to the right of B.\n\nLet's try to place the books step by step:\n\n1. Place A in position 2.\n2. Place D in position 4.\n3. Since F must be adjacent to D, place F in position 3.\n4. G must be to the left of D, so place G in position 1.\n5. Now, we have positions 5, 6, and 7 left for B, C, and E.\n6. E must be adjacent to C, and C must be to the right of B. So, place B in position 5, E in position 6, and C in position 7.\n\nLet's verify the constraints:\n\n- F is not in position 7.\n- G is to the left of D.\n- E is not in position 1.\n- E is adjacent to C.\n- F is to the left of C.\n- D is adjacent to F.\n- D is in position 4.\n- A is in position 2.\n- C is to the right of B.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n1. G\n2. A\n3. F\n4. D\n5. B\n6. E\n7. C\n\nLet's present the final answer:\n\n<<<[\"G\", \"A\", \"F\", \"D\", \"B\", \"E\", \"C\"]>>>"
