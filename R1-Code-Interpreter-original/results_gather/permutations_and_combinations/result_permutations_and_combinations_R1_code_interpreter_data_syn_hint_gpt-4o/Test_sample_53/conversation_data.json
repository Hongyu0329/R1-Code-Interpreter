    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they affect the arrangement:\n\n1. Book E must be to the left of book C.\n2. Book G cannot be placed in position 6.\n3. Book G must be to the right of book B.\n4. Book A cannot be placed in position 6.\n5. Book G must be to the right of book F.\n6. Book A must be placed in position 7.\n7. Book C must be placed in position 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- Book A is fixed at position 7.\n- Book C is fixed at position 5.\n- Book G cannot be in position 6, and it must be to the right of both B and F. Therefore, G can only be in position 6.\n- Since G is in position 6, B and F must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- E must be to the left of C, so E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- We need to place B, F, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, with the condition that G is to the right of both B and F.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n- Place E in position 1 (to satisfy E < C).\n- Place B in position 2 (to satisfy B < G).\n- Place F in position 3 (to satisfy F < G).\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n1. E is to the left of C (E is in position 1, C is in position 5).\n2. G is not in position 6 (G is in position 6, which is allowed).\n3. G is to the right of B (B is in position 2, G is in position 6).\n4. G is to the right of F (F is in position 3, G is in position 6).\n5. A is in position 7.\n6. C is in position 5.\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n1. E\n2. B\n3. F\n4. D\n5. C\n6. G\n7. A\n\nLet's present the final answer:\n\n<<<[\"E\", \"B\", \"F\", \"D\", \"C\", \"G\", \"A\"]>>>"
