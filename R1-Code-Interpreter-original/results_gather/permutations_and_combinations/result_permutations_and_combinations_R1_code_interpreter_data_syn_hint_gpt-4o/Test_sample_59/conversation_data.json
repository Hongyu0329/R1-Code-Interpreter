    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in arranging the books:\n\n1. **Book D must be adjacent to book F.**\n2. **Book F must be to the right of book D.**\n3. **Book B must be to the right of book G.**\n4. **Book E must be placed in position 4.**\n5. **Book B cannot be placed in position 2.**\n6. **Book D must be to the right of book E.**\n7. **Book A must be adjacent to book C.**\n8. **Book F must be to the right of book A.**\n9. **Book F must be to the right of book D.**\n\nLet's start by placing book E in position 4, as it is a fixed position. This gives us:\n\n- Position 4: E\n\nNext, we know that D must be to the right of E (constraint 6), and F must be to the right of D (constraint 9). Therefore, D and F must be placed in positions 5 and 6, respectively, since F must be adjacent to D and to the right of D (constraints 1 and 2).\n\n- Position 5: D\n- Position 6: F\n\nNow, we need to place A and C adjacent to each other (constraint 7). Since F must be to the right of A (constraint 8), A and C must be placed in positions 2 and 3, respectively.\n\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: C\n\nFinally, we need to place B and G. B must be to the right of G (constraint 3), and B cannot be in position 2 (constraint 5). The only remaining positions are 1 and 7. Therefore, G must be in position 1, and B must be in position 7.\n\n- Position 1: G\n- Position 7: B\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n1. D is adjacent to F, and F is to the right of D.\n2. B is to the right of G.\n3. E is in position 4.\n4. B is not in position 2.\n5. D is to the right of E.\n6. A is adjacent to C.\n7. F is to the right of A.\n8. F is to the right of D.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"G\", \"A\", \"C\", \"E\", \"D\", \"F\", \"B\"]>>>"
