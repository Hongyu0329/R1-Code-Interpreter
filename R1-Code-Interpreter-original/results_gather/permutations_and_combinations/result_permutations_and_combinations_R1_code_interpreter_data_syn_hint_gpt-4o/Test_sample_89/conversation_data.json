    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in placing the books:\n\n1. **Book C must be to the right of book B.**\n2. **Book B must be adjacent to book E.**\n3. **Book D must be to the right of book E.**\n4. **Book F cannot be placed in position 5.**\n5. **Book B cannot be placed in position 2.**\n6. **Book F must be to the right of book C.**\n7. **Book A cannot be placed in position 6.**\n8. **Book C must be placed in position 4.**\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books:\n\n- **Constraint 8** tells us that Book C is in position 4.\n- **Constraint 6** tells us that Book F must be to the right of Book C, so F can be in positions 5, 6, or 7.\n- **Constraint 1** tells us that Book B must be to the left of Book C, so B can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Constraint 5** tells us that Book B cannot be in position 2, so B can only be in positions 1 or 3.\n- **Constraint 2** tells us that Book B must be adjacent to Book E. If B is in position 1, E must be in position 2. If B is in position 3, E must be in position 2.\n- **Constraint 3** tells us that Book D must be to the right of Book E. If E is in position 2, D can be in positions 3, 5, 6, or 7.\n- **Constraint 4** tells us that Book F cannot be in position 5, so F can only be in positions 6 or 7.\n- **Constraint 7** tells us that Book A cannot be in position 6, so A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nLet's try to place the books based on these constraints:\n\n1. Place C in position 4.\n2. Place B in position 3 (since B cannot be in position 2 and must be adjacent to E).\n3. Place E in position 2 (adjacent to B).\n4. Place D in position 5 (to the right of E).\n5. Place F in position 6 (to the right of C and not in position 5).\n6. Place A in position 1 (since A cannot be in position 6).\n7. Place G in position 7 (the only remaining position).\n\nNow, let's verify this arrangement:\n\n- C is in position 4, satisfying constraint 8.\n- B is in position 3, to the left of C, satisfying constraint 1.\n- B is adjacent to E, satisfying constraint 2.\n- D is in position 5, to the right of E, satisfying constraint 3.\n- F is in position 6, not in position 5, satisfying constraint 4.\n- F is to the right of C, satisfying constraint 6.\n- A is not in position 6, satisfying constraint 7.\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the final arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"F\", \"G\"]>>>"
