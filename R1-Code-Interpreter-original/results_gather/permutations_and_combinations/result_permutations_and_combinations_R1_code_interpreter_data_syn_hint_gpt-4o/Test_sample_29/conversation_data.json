    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book E must be placed in position 4.\n2. Book A cannot be placed in position 2.\n3. Book A must be to the right of book D.\n4. Book C must be placed in position 1.\n5. Book A must be placed in position 3.\n6. Book D must be adjacent to book C.\n7. Book D must be placed in position 2.\n\nLet's start by placing the books according to the constraints:\n\n- From constraint 4, we place Book C in position 1.\n- From constraint 7, we place Book D in position 2.\n- From constraint 5, we place Book A in position 3.\n- From constraint 1, we place Book E in position 4.\n\nNow, we have the following arrangement so far: [C, D, A, E, _, _]\n\nThe remaining books are B and F, and they can be placed in positions 5 and 6. There are no constraints on the positions of B and F, so they can be placed in any order.\n\nThus, one possible arrangement is: [C, D, A, E, B, F]\n\nLet's provide the answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"D\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"F\"]>>>"
