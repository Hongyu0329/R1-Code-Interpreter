    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book A must be to the right of book E.\n2. Book G must be adjacent to book A.\n3. Book B must be placed in position 2.\n4. Book E must be to the left of book C.\n5. Book C must be to the right of book E.\n6. Book E must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book D must be adjacent to book G.\n8. Book C cannot be placed in position 5.\n9. Book A must be placed in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books that have fixed positions:\n\n- Book B is in position 2.\n- Book A is in position 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the other constraints:\n\n- Since A is in position 4, G must be adjacent to A, so G can be in position 3 or 5.\n- D must be adjacent to G, so if G is in position 3, D can be in position 1 or 4. If G is in position 5, D can be in position 4 or 6.\n- E must be to the left of A and C, and to the right of B. So E can be in position 3.\n- C must be to the right of E and cannot be in position 5, so C can be in position 5 or 6.\n- F is the remaining book and can be placed in any remaining position.\n\nLet's try to place the books according to these constraints:\n\n- Place B in position 2.\n- Place A in position 4.\n- Place E in position 3 (since it must be to the right of B and to the left of A).\n- Place G in position 5 (adjacent to A).\n- Place D in position 6 (adjacent to G).\n- Place C in position 7 (to the right of E and not in position 5).\n- Place F in position 1 (the only remaining position).\n\nNow, let's verify this arrangement:\n\n1. A is to the right of E (E is in position 3, A is in position 4).\n2. G is adjacent to A (G is in position 5, A is in position 4).\n3. B is in position 2.\n4. E is to the left of C (E is in position 3, C is in position 7).\n5. C is to the right of E (C is in position 7, E is in position 3).\n6. E is to the right of B (E is in position 3, B is in position 2).\n7. D is adjacent to G (D is in position 6, G is in position 5).\n8. C is not in position 5 (C is in position 7).\n9. A is in position 4.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the correct order of books is:\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"B\", \"E\", \"A\", \"G\", \"D\", \"C\"]>>>"
