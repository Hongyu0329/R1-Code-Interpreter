    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in arranging the books:\n\n1. Book G cannot be placed in position 7.\n2. Book F must be to the left of book B.\n3. Book B must be to the right of book D.\n4. Book E cannot be placed in position 2.\n5. Book B must be to the right of book G.\n6. Book D cannot be placed in position 7.\n7. Book D must be to the left of book G.\n8. Book F must be placed in position 3.\n\nFrom constraint 8, we know that Book F is in position 3. This is a fixed position.\n\nNow, let's consider the other constraints:\n\n- From constraint 2, since F is in position 3, B must be in a position greater than 3.\n- From constraint 3, D must be in a position less than B.\n- From constraint 5, G must be in a position less than B.\n- From constraint 7, D must be in a position less than G.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Place F in position 3.\n2. Since D must be to the left of G and G must be to the left of B, we can try placing D in position 1, G in position 2, and B in position 4.\n3. E cannot be in position 2, so it can be placed in position 5.\n4. This leaves positions 6 and 7 for A and C. Since G cannot be in position 7, we can place A in position 6 and C in position 7.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n- F is in position 3.\n- D (position 1) is to the left of G (position 2).\n- G (position 2) is to the left of B (position 4).\n- B (position 4) is to the right of D (position 1).\n- E is not in position 2.\n- D is not in position 7.\n- G is not in position 7.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"G\", \"F\", \"B\", \"E\", \"A\", \"C\"]>>>"
