    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Book D must be placed in position 5.\n2. Book E must be to the right of book C.\n3. Book B cannot be placed in position 1.\n4. Book G must be to the left of book F.\n5. Book A must be to the left of book D.\n6. Book B must be to the left of book C.\n7. Book B must be placed in position 4.\n8. Book D must be to the left of book E.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- From constraint 1, we know D is in position 5.\n- From constraint 7, B is in position 4.\n- From constraint 5, A must be to the left of D, so A can be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- From constraint 6, B is to the left of C, so C must be in position 6 or 7.\n- From constraint 8, D is to the left of E, so E must be in position 6 or 7.\n- From constraint 2, E is to the right of C, so C must be in position 6 and E in position 7.\n- From constraint 3, B cannot be in position 1, which is already satisfied as B is in position 4.\n- From constraint 4, G must be to the left of F. Since positions 1, 2, and 3 are left, and A must be to the left of D, A can be in position 1, G in position 2, and F in position 3.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n1. A is in position 1.\n2. G is in position 2.\n3. F is in position 3.\n4. B is in position 4.\n5. D is in position 5.\n6. C is in position 6.\n7. E is in position 7.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"G\", \"F\", \"B\", \"D\", \"C\", \"E\"]>>>"
