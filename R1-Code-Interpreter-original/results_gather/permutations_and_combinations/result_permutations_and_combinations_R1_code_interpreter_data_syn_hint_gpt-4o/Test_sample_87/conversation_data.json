    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in arranging the books:\n\n1. Book C must be to the left of book D.\n2. Book A must be to the left of book C.\n3. Book F must be placed in position 2.\n4. Book A must be to the right of book E.\n5. Book G cannot be placed in position 6.\n6. Book G cannot be placed in position 2.\n7. Book C must be to the right of book B.\n8. Book G cannot be placed in position 6. (This is a duplicate of constraint 5)\n\nLet's start by placing book F in position 2, as it is a fixed position. Then, we will try to place the other books around it while satisfying the constraints.\n\n- Since F is in position 2, G cannot be in position 2. Also, G cannot be in position 6.\n- A must be to the right of E, so E must be placed before A.\n- C must be to the left of D and to the right of B, so the order of these books must be B, C, D.\n\nLet's try to find a valid arrangement by considering these constraints:\n\n1. Place F in position 2.\n2. Place E in position 1 (since A must be to the right of E).\n3. Place A in position 3 (since A must be to the left of C and to the right of E).\n4. Place B in position 4 (since C must be to the right of B).\n5. Place C in position 5 (since C must be to the left of D).\n6. Place D in position 6.\n7. Place G in position 7 (since G cannot be in position 6 or 2).\n\nNow, let's verify if this arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- C is to the left of D: Yes, C is in position 5 and D is in position 6.\n- A is to the left of C: Yes, A is in position 3 and C is in position 5.\n- F is in position 2: Yes.\n- A is to the right of E: Yes, A is in position 3 and E is in position 1.\n- G is not in position 6: Yes, G is in position 7.\n- G is not in position 2: Yes, G is in position 7.\n- C is to the right of B: Yes, C is in position 5 and B is in position 4.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"E\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"G\"]>>>"
