    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they guide the arrangement:\n\n1. Book G cannot be placed in position 1.\n2. Book D must be to the left of book C.\n3. Book B must be to the right of book G.\n4. Book C must be placed in position 7.\n5. Book E must be adjacent to book A.\n6. Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n7. Book A must be placed in position 1.\n8. Book G must be to the right of book D.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- **Position 1**: Book A must be placed here due to constraint 7.\n- **Position 7**: Book C must be placed here due to constraint 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining positions (2 to 6) and the remaining books (B, D, E, F, G):\n\n- **Position 2**: Since E must be adjacent to A (constraint 5), E can be placed here.\n- **Position 3**: D must be to the left of G (constraint 8), so D can be placed here.\n- **Position 4**: G must be to the right of D (constraint 8) and to the left of B (constraint 3), so G can be placed here.\n- **Position 5**: B must be to the right of G (constraint 3), so B can be placed here.\n- **Position 6**: The only remaining book is F, so F can be placed here.\n\nLet's verify the arrangement:\n\n1. A is in position 1.\n2. E is adjacent to A.\n3. D is to the left of C.\n4. G is to the right of D.\n5. B is to the right of G.\n6. C is in position 7.\n7. E is not in position 7.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the final arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"E\", \"D\", \"G\", \"B\", \"F\", \"C\"]>>>"
