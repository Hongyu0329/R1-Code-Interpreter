    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book F must be adjacent to book D.\n2. Book C must be adjacent to book F.\n3. Book F cannot be placed in position 1.\n4. Book B must be to the right of book G.\n5. Book B must be placed in position 3.\n6. Book E must be to the left of book C.\n7. Book G must be placed in position 2.\n8. Book A cannot be placed in position 4.\n9. Book A must be to the left of book D.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books that have fixed positions:\n\n- Book G is in position 2.\n- Book B is in position 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the adjacency constraints:\n\n- Since F must be adjacent to D and C must be adjacent to F, the possible sequences for these three books are: DFC, FDC, CFD, CDF, DCF, FCD. However, since F cannot be in position 1, we can eliminate sequences where F is in position 1.\n\n- Book E must be to the left of book C, which further restricts the possible sequences.\n\nLet's try to place the books step by step:\n\n1. Place G in position 2 and B in position 3.\n2. Since B is in position 3, F cannot be in position 3, and since F cannot be in position 1, F must be in position 4 or 5.\n3. If F is in position 4, then D can be in position 5 and C in position 6 (satisfying the adjacency constraints). This also satisfies the condition that E must be to the left of C.\n4. A cannot be in position 4, so A can be in position 1 or 5. Since A must be to the left of D, A must be in position 1.\n5. This leaves position 7 for the remaining book, which is E.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n- A is in position 1.\n- G is in position 2.\n- B is in position 3.\n- F is in position 4.\n- D is in position 5.\n- C is in position 6.\n- E is in position 7.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the final arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"G\", \"B\", \"F\", \"D\", \"C\", \"E\"]>>>"
