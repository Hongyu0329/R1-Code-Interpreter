    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book A must be placed in position 3.\n2. Book A cannot be placed in position 1. (This is redundant since A is already in position 3.)\n3. Book F must be to the right of book B.\n4. Book E cannot be placed in position 1.\n5. Book E must be adjacent to book D.\n6. Book E must be to the right of book D.\n7. Book B must be to the right of book E.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- Place A in position 3 as per constraint 1.\n- E and D must be adjacent, with E to the right of D. Possible pairs are (D, E) in positions (1, 2) or (2, 4) or (4, 5).\n- B must be to the right of E, so B can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.\n- F must be to the right of B, so F can be in positions 5 or 6.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n1. Place D in position 2 and E in position 4 (since E cannot be in position 1).\n2. Place B in position 5 (to the right of E).\n3. Place F in position 6 (to the right of B).\n4. The remaining book, C, will be placed in position 1.\n\nThis gives us the arrangement: C, D, A, E, B, F.\n\nLet's verify:\n- A is in position 3.\n- F is to the right of B.\n- E is adjacent to D and to the right of D.\n- B is to the right of E.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the arrangement is correct.\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"D\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"F\"]>>>"
