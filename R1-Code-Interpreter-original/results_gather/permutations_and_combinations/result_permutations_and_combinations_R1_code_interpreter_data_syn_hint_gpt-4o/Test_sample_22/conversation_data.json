    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book C must be adjacent to book E.\n2. Book C must be to the left of book B.\n3. Book F must be adjacent to book B.\n4. Book B cannot be placed in position 6.\n5. Book D must be to the right of book E.\n6. Book C must be placed in position 1.\n7. Book A must be placed in position 3.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- From constraint 6, we know that Book C is in position 1.\n- From constraint 7, we know that Book A is in position 3.\n- From constraint 1, Book E must be adjacent to Book C. Since Book C is in position 1, Book E must be in position 2.\n- From constraint 5, Book D must be to the right of Book E. Since Book E is in position 2, Book D can be in position 4, 5, or 6.\n- From constraint 2, Book C must be to the left of Book B. Since Book C is in position 1, Book B can be in position 4, 5, or 6.\n- From constraint 3, Book F must be adjacent to Book B. This means if Book B is in position 4, Book F can be in position 5; if Book B is in position 5, Book F can be in position 4 or 6; if Book B is in position 6, Book F can be in position 5.\n- From constraint 4, Book B cannot be in position 6.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining books:\n\n- Book C is in position 1.\n- Book E is in position 2.\n- Book A is in position 3.\n- Book B cannot be in position 6, so let's try placing Book B in position 4. Then, Book F must be in position 5 (adjacent to B), and Book D must be in position 6 (to the right of E).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n1. C is adjacent to E.\n2. C is to the left of B.\n3. F is adjacent to B.\n4. B is not in position 6.\n5. D is to the right of E.\n6. C is in position 1.\n7. A is in position 3.\n\nThus, the arrangement is: C, E, A, B, F, D.\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"E\", \"A\", \"B\", \"F\", \"D\"]>>>"
