    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in placing the books:\n\n1. Book E must be to the right of book C.\n2. Book C cannot be placed in position 5.\n3. Book A cannot be placed in position 6.\n4. Book B cannot be placed in position 3.\n5. Book E must be to the left of book D.\n6. Book D must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book D must be placed in position 5.\n8. Book G must be to the right of book F.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books that have fixed positions or relative positions:\n\n- Constraint 7 tells us that Book D must be placed in position 5.\n- From constraint 6, since D is in position 5, B must be in a position less than 5.\n- From constraint 5, E must be in a position less than 5, but greater than C.\n- From constraint 1, E must be to the right of C.\n- From constraint 8, G must be to the right of F.\n\nLet's try to place the books step by step:\n\n1. Place D in position 5 (from constraint 7).\n2. Place B in a position less than 5, and not in position 3 (from constraints 4 and 6). Possible positions for B are 1, 2, or 4.\n3. Place E in a position less than 5, but greater than C (from constraints 1 and 5). Possible positions for E are 3 or 4.\n4. Place C in a position less than E and not in position 5 (from constraints 1 and 2). Possible positions for C are 1, 2, or 3.\n5. Place A in a position not equal to 6 (from constraint 3). Possible positions for A are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n6. Place F and G such that G is to the right of F (from constraint 8). Possible positions for F and G are any positions that satisfy this condition.\n\nNow, let's try to find a valid arrangement by testing these possibilities:\n\n- Place B in position 2.\n- Place C in position 1.\n- Place E in position 3.\n- Place A in position 4.\n- Place F in position 6.\n- Place G in position 7.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- E (position 3) is to the right of C (position 1).\n- C is not in position 5.\n- A is not in position 6.\n- B is not in position 3.\n- E (position 3) is to the left of D (position 5).\n- D (position 5) is to the right of B (position 2).\n- D is in position 5.\n- G (position 7) is to the right of F (position 6).\n\nThus, the arrangement is: C, B, E, A, D, F, G.\n\nLet's output this arrangement:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"B\", \"E\", \"A\", \"D\", \"F\", \"G\"]>>>"
