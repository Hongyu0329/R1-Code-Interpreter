    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n1. Book B cannot be placed in position 5.\n2. Book E cannot be placed in position 7.\n3. Book A must be adjacent to book B.\n4. Book G must be to the left of book D.\n5. Book E must be to the right of book G.\n6. Book G must be to the left of book C.\n7. Book C cannot be placed in position 3.\n8. Book D must be placed in position 5.\n9. Book B must be to the right of book E.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing book D in position 5, as it is the only fixed position:\n\n- Position 5: D\n\nNow, let's consider the placement of G, E, and C, as they have relative positioning constraints:\n\n- G must be to the left of D, E, and C.\n- E must be to the right of G.\n- C must be to the right of G and cannot be in position 3.\n\nLet's try placing G in position 1:\n\n- Position 1: G\n\nNow, E must be to the right of G, and B must be to the right of E. Let's try placing E in position 3:\n\n- Position 3: E\n\nNow, B must be to the right of E, and A must be adjacent to B. Let's try placing B in position 4 and A in position 2:\n\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 4: B\n\nNow, C must be to the right of G and cannot be in position 3. The only available position for C is position 6:\n\n- Position 6: C\n\nFinally, the only remaining book is F, which can be placed in the only remaining position, position 7:\n\n- Position 7: F\n\nLet's verify the arrangement:\n\n1. B is not in position 5. (True)\n2. E is not in position 7. (True)\n3. A is adjacent to B. (True)\n4. G is to the left of D. (True)\n5. E is to the right of G. (True)\n6. G is to the left of C. (True)\n7. C is not in position 3. (True)\n8. D is in position 5. (True)\n9. B is to the right of E. (True)\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n<<<[\"G\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\", \"C\", \"F\"]>>>"
