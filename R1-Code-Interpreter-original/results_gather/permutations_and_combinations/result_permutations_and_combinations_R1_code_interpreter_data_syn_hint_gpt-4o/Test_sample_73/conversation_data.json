    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G on a shelf with positions 1 to 7, while satisfying all the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in placing the books:\n\n1. Book C cannot be placed in position 4.\n2. Book C must be placed in position 5. (This overrides constraint 1, so C is definitely in position 5.)\n3. Book A cannot be placed in position 5. (This is already satisfied since C is in position 5.)\n4. Book D must be adjacent to book F.\n5. Book F must be to the left of book B.\n6. Book G must be to the right of book B.\n7. Book F must be to the left of book G.\n8. Book E must be placed in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Place C in position 5.\n- Place E in position 4.\n- Since D must be adjacent to F, and F must be to the left of B, we can try placing F in position 3 and D in position 2.\n- B must be to the right of F, so B can be placed in position 6.\n- G must be to the right of B, so G can be placed in position 7.\n- Finally, A is the only book left, and it can be placed in position 1.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n- C is in position 5.\n- E is in position 4.\n- D is adjacent to F (D in position 2, F in position 3).\n- F is to the left of B (F in position 3, B in position 6).\n- G is to the right of B (B in position 6, G in position 7).\n- F is to the left of G (F in position 3, G in position 7).\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books from left to right is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"D\", \"F\", \"E\", \"C\", \"B\", \"G\"]>>>"
