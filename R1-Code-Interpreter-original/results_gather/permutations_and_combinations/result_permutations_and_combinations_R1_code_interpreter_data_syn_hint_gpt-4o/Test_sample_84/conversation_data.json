    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can guide us in arranging the books:\n\n1. **Book B must be to the left of book G.**\n2. **Book B must be to the left of book E.**\n3. **Book F must be adjacent to book B.**\n4. **Book G must be adjacent to book C.**\n5. **Book C must be to the left of book D.**\n6. **Book C cannot be placed in position 5.**\n7. **Book C must be to the left of book A.**\n8. **Book A cannot be placed in position 2.**\n\nLet's start by considering the adjacency constraints:\n\n- **Book F must be adjacent to book B.** This means F and B must be next to each other.\n- **Book G must be adjacent to book C.** This means G and C must be next to each other.\n\nNow, let's consider the order constraints:\n\n- **Book B must be to the left of book G and book E.** This implies B is before G and E.\n- **Book C must be to the left of book D and book A.** This implies C is before D and A.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a possible arrangement:\n\n1. Start with the adjacency pairs: (F, B) and (G, C).\n2. Since B must be to the left of G, and F is adjacent to B, the pair (F, B) must come before (G, C).\n3. C must be to the left of D and A, so C must be placed before D and A.\n4. A cannot be in position 2, so it must be placed elsewhere.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n- Start with (F, B) since B must be to the left of G.\n- Place (G, C) after (F, B) since G is adjacent to C.\n- Place D after C since C must be to the left of D.\n- Place A after C since C must be to the left of A, and A cannot be in position 2.\n- Finally, place E after B since B must be to the left of E.\n\nLet's try the arrangement: F, B, G, C, D, A, E\n\nNow, let's verify this arrangement against all constraints:\n\n1. B is to the left of G (True).\n2. B is to the left of E (True).\n3. F is adjacent to B (True).\n4. G is adjacent to C (True).\n5. C is to the left of D (True).\n6. C is not in position 5 (True, C is in position 4).\n7. C is to the left of A (True).\n8. A is not in position 2 (True, A is in position 6).\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the arrangement is valid.\n\n<<<[\"F\", \"B\", \"G\", \"C\", \"D\", \"A\", \"E\"]>>>"
