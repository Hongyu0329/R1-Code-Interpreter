    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book C must be to the right of book D.\n2. Book F must be adjacent to book A.\n3. Book F must be to the left of book C.\n4. Book G must be to the right of book A.\n5. Book G must be to the left of book E.\n6. Book B must be placed in position 3.\n7. Book D cannot be placed in position 7.\n8. Book C must be placed in position 6.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start by placing the books that have fixed positions:\n\n- Book B is in position 3.\n- Book C is in position 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the other constraints:\n\n- Since C is in position 6, D must be in a position to the left of 6, and it cannot be in position 7.\n- F must be adjacent to A, and F must be to the left of C, so F can be in position 5 or 4.\n- G must be to the right of A and to the left of E.\n\nLet's try to place the books step by step:\n\n1. Place B in position 3.\n2. Place C in position 6.\n3. Since F must be adjacent to A and to the left of C, let's place F in position 5 and A in position 4.\n4. Now, G must be to the right of A, so G can be in position 7.\n5. E must be to the right of G, so E can be in position 7.\n6. D must be to the left of C, and it cannot be in position 7, so D can be in position 1.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n- D is in position 1, which is to the left of C in position 6.\n- F is in position 5, adjacent to A in position 4.\n- F is to the left of C.\n- G is in position 7, to the right of A in position 4.\n- G is to the left of E in position 7.\n- B is in position 3.\n- C is in position 6.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"A\", \"B\", \"F\", \"C\", \"G\", \"E\"]>>>"
