    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book E must be placed in position 6.\n2. Book C must be to the right of book A.\n3. Book D cannot be placed in position 5.\n4. Book A must be adjacent to book F.\n5. Book E must be to the right of book D.\n6. Book F must be adjacent to book B.\n7. Book A must be placed in position 1.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- From constraint 7, we know that Book A is in position 1.\n- From constraint 4, Book F must be adjacent to Book A, so Book F can be in position 2.\n- From constraint 6, Book F must be adjacent to Book B, so Book B can be in position 3.\n- From constraint 2, Book C must be to the right of Book A, so Book C can be in position 4.\n- From constraint 5, Book E must be to the right of Book D, and since Book E is in position 6 (from constraint 1), Book D must be in position 5.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n1. A is in position 1.\n2. F is adjacent to A in position 2.\n3. B is adjacent to F in position 3.\n4. C is to the right of A in position 4.\n5. D is in position 5, which is not position 5 (satisfying constraint 3).\n6. E is in position 6, which is to the right of D.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the order of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"A\", \"F\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"]>>>"
