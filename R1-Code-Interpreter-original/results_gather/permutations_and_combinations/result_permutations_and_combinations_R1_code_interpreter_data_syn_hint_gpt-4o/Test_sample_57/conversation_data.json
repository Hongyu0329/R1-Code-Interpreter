    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book D must be placed in position 4.\n2. Book B cannot be placed in position 1.\n3. Book F must be to the right of book D.\n4. Book C must be placed in position 1.\n5. Book F must be to the left of book E.\n6. Book G must be adjacent to book C.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- **Position 1**: Book C (from constraint 5).\n- **Position 4**: Book D (from constraint 1).\n\nNow, let's consider the placement of other books:\n\n- **Position 2 or 3**: Book G (from constraint 6, G must be adjacent to C).\n- **Position 5, 6, or 7**: Book F (from constraint 3, F must be to the right of D).\n- **Position 6 or 7**: Book E (from constraint 5, F must be to the left of E).\n\nLet's try to place the books in a way that satisfies all constraints:\n\n- **Position 1**: C\n- **Position 2**: G (G must be adjacent to C)\n- **Position 3**: A (since B cannot be in position 1, and G is in position 2)\n- **Position 4**: D\n- **Position 5**: F (F must be to the right of D)\n- **Position 6**: E (F must be to the left of E)\n- **Position 7**: B (B cannot be in position 1)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Let's verify:\n\n- C is in position 1.\n- D is in position 4.\n- F is to the right of D.\n- F is to the left of E.\n- G is adjacent to C.\n- B is not in position 1.\n\nThus, the arrangement is valid. The final arrangement of the books is:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"G\", \"A\", \"D\", \"F\", \"E\", \"B\"]>>>"
