    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Book D cannot be placed in position 4.\n2. Book C must be to the left of book E.\n3. Book C must be to the left of book A.\n4. Book F must be to the left of book D.\n5. Book F must be placed in position 2.\n6. Book B must be placed in position 5.\n7. Book E must be placed in position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's start placing the books:\n\n- Book F is placed in position 2 (Constraint 5).\n- Book B is placed in position 5 (Constraint 6).\n- Book E is placed in position 4 (Constraint 7).\n\nNow, the positions are partially filled as follows:\n1. ?\n2. F\n3. ?\n4. E\n5. B\n6. ?\n\nNext, we need to place the remaining books: A, C, and D.\n\n- Book C must be to the left of both E and A (Constraints 2 and 3). Since E is in position 4, C must be in position 1 or 3.\n- Book F (in position 2) must be to the left of D (Constraint 4), so D cannot be in position 1. Therefore, D must be in position 6.\n- Since D is in position 6, C must be in position 1 to satisfy the constraint of being to the left of both E and A.\n- Finally, A must be placed in the remaining position, which is position 3.\n\nThe final arrangement of books is:\n1. C\n2. F\n3. A\n4. E\n5. B\n6. D\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given constraints. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<[\"C\", \"F\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\"]>>>"
