    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Book F must be placed in position 4.**\n   - This is a fixed position for book F.\n\n2. **Book E cannot be placed in position 2.**\n   - E can be in any position except 2.\n\n3. **Book B must be to the right of book F.**\n   - Since F is in position 4, B must be in positions 5, 6, or 7.\n\n4. **Book A cannot be placed in position 7.**\n   - A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.\n\n5. **Book E cannot be placed in position 6.**\n   - E can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n6. **Book A cannot be placed in position 4.**\n   - A can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.\n\n7. **Book A must be to the left of book C.**\n   - A must be in a position less than C.\n\n8. **Book A must be to the right of book F.**\n   - Since F is in position 4, A must be in positions 5 or 6.\n\n9. **Book A must be to the right of book D.**\n   - D must be in a position less than A.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to find a valid arrangement:\n\n- F is fixed at position 4.\n- A must be in position 5 or 6.\n- B must be in position 5, 6, or 7, but to the right of F.\n- E can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.\n- C must be to the right of A.\n\nLet's try to place A in position 5:\n- If A is in position 5, then B can be in position 6 or 7.\n- C must be in position 6 or 7, but to the right of A.\n- D must be in position 1, 2, or 3, but to the left of A.\n- E can be in position 1, 3, or 7.\n\nLet's try to place A in position 5, B in position 6, and C in position 7:\n- D can be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- E can be in position 1 or 3.\n\nLet's place D in position 1 and E in position 3:\n- This satisfies all constraints.\n\nThe arrangement is: D, E, G, F, A, B, C.\n\nLet's verify:\n- F is in position 4.\n- E is not in position 2 or 6.\n- B is to the right of F.\n- A is not in position 7 or 4.\n- A is to the left of C.\n- A is to the right of F and D.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<[\"D\", \"E\", \"G\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]>>>"
