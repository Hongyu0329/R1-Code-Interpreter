    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter, which is the case here since choosing classes is not dependent on the order in which they are chosen.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[ C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from,\n- \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose,\n- \\( n! \\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\nIn this problem:\n- \\( n = 8 \\) (the total number of math classes),\n- \\( r = 3 \\) (the number of classes Michael wants to choose).\n\nSubstituting these values into the combination formula gives:\n\n\\[ C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\times 5!} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n1. \\( 8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320 \\)\n2. \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n3. \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\)\n\nSubstitute these values back into the combination formula:\n\n\\[ C(8, 3) = \\frac{40320}{6 \\times 120} = \\frac{40320}{720} = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 56 different ways for Michael to choose 3 out of 8 math classes.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<56>>>"
