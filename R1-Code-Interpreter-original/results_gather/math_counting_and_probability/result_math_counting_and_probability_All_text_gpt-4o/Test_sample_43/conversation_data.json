    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that it will not rain tomorrow, given the probability that it will rain.\n\n1. **Understand the given probability**: The probability of rain tomorrow is given as \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\).\n\n2. **Recall the basic probability principle**: The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes of an event is 1. In this case, the two possible outcomes are \"it will rain\" and \"it will not rain.\"\n\n3. **Set up the equation**: Let \\(P(\\text{rain})\\) be the probability that it will rain, and \\(P(\\text{no rain})\\) be the probability that it will not rain. According to the basic probability principle:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{rain}) + P(\\text{no rain}) = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute the given probability**: We know \\(P(\\text{rain}) = \\frac{3}{10}\\). Substitute this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{10} + P(\\text{no rain}) = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(P(\\text{no rain})\\)**: To find \\(P(\\text{no rain})\\), subtract \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{no rain}) = 1 - \\frac{3}{10}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Perform the subtraction**: Convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 10:\n   \\[\n   1 = \\frac{10}{10}\n   \\]\n   Now subtract:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{no rain}) = \\frac{10}{10} - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{10}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Express the answer**: The probability that it will not rain tomorrow is \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7/10>>>"
