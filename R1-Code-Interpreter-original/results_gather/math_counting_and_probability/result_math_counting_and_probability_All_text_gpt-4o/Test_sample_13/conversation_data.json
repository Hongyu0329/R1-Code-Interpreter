    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that two randomly chosen cards from a standard 52-card deck are both number cards (2 through 10) and that their values sum to 12. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number cards**: In a standard deck, the number cards are 2 through 10. Each of these cards appears in four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades), so there are 4 cards of each number.\n\n2. **Possible pairs that sum to 12**: We need to find pairs of numbers between 2 and 10 that add up to 12. These pairs are:\n   - 2 and 10\n   - 3 and 9\n   - 4 and 8\n   - 5 and 7\n   - 6 and 6\n\n3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose each pair**:\n   - For pairs (2, 10), (3, 9), (4, 8), and (5, 7), there are 4 ways to choose the first card and 4 ways to choose the second card, giving \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) ways for each pair.\n   - For the pair (6, 6), since both cards are the same, we choose 2 cards from the 4 available sixes. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n4. **Total number of favorable outcomes**: Add the number of ways for each pair:\n   - (2, 10): 16 ways\n   - (3, 9): 16 ways\n   - (4, 8): 16 ways\n   - (5, 7): 16 ways\n   - (6, 6): 6 ways\n\n   Total = 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 6 = 70 ways\n\n5. **Total number of ways to choose any 2 cards from the deck**: The total number of ways to choose 2 cards from a 52-card deck is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{52}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 1326\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that both cards are numbers totaling to 12 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{70}{1326}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the fraction**: Simplify \\(\\frac{70}{1326}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 70 and 1326, which is 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{70}{1326} = \\frac{35}{663}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that both cards are numbers totaling to 12 is \\(\\frac{35}{663}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<35/663>>>"
