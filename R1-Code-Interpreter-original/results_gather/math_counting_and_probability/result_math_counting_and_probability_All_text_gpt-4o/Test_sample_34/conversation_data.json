    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a green ball from the randomly chosen container. We will use the law of total probability, considering each container's contribution to the overall probability.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the probability of selecting each container.**\n\nThere are three containers, and each is equally likely to be selected. Therefore, the probability of selecting any one container is:\n\\[ P(\\text{Container I}) = P(\\text{Container II}) = P(\\text{Container III}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the probability of selecting a green ball from each container.**\n\n- **Container I:** \n  - Total balls = 8 red + 4 green = 12 balls\n  - Probability of selecting a green ball = \\(\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n- **Container II:**\n  - Total balls = 2 red + 4 green = 6 balls\n  - Probability of selecting a green ball = \\(\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n- **Container III:**\n  - Total balls = 2 red + 4 green = 6 balls\n  - Probability of selecting a green ball = \\(\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n**Step 3: Use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of selecting a green ball.**\n\nThe overall probability of selecting a green ball is the sum of the probabilities of selecting a green ball from each container, weighted by the probability of selecting that container:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Green}) = P(\\text{Container I}) \\times P(\\text{Green | Container I}) + P(\\text{Container II}) \\times P(\\text{Green | Container II}) + P(\\text{Container III}) \\times P(\\text{Green | Container III})\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}\\)\n\nAdd these probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the ball selected is green is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<5/9>>>"
