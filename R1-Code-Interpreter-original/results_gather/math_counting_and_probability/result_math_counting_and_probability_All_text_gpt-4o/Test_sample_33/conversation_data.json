    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that no two of the three randomly chosen points on a circle form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - We have a circle, and we choose three points uniformly at random on its circumference.\n   - We need to check if any of the triangles formed by these points and the circle's center are obtuse.\n\n2. **Properties of Triangles**:\n   - A triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than 90 degrees.\n   - For a triangle formed by the center of the circle (O) and two points on the circle (A and B), the angle âˆ AOB is obtuse if the arc AB is greater than 180 degrees.\n\n3. **Random Selection of Points**:\n   - When three points are chosen on a circle, they divide the circle into three arcs.\n   - The sum of the angles subtended by these arcs at the center is 360 degrees.\n\n4. **Condition for No Obtuse Triangle**:\n   - For no obtuse triangle to be formed, each of the arcs must be less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n   - This means that the largest arc must be less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n\n5. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The probability that the largest arc is less than or equal to 180 degrees is equivalent to the probability that the largest angle in the triangle formed by the three points is less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n   - When three points are chosen randomly on a circle, the probability that the largest arc is less than or equal to 180 degrees is 1/4. This is because the largest arc is more than 180 degrees if and only if one of the points lies in the semicircle opposite the other two points.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The probability that no two of the three points form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center is 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.25>>>"
