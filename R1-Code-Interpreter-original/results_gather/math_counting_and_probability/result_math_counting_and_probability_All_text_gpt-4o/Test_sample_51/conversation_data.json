    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unit squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) ring around a central square in a grid.\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:**\n   - The central square is surrounded by rings of unit squares.\n   - The first ring contains 8 unit squares.\n   - The second ring contains 16 unit squares.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern:**\n   - The number of unit squares in each ring forms a sequence: 8, 16, 24, 32, ...\n   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 8.\n\n3. **General Formula for the \\(n^{th}\\) Ring:**\n   - The number of unit squares in the \\(n^{th}\\) ring can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     a_n = 8n\n     \\]\n   - This formula is derived from the observation that each ring adds an additional layer of squares around the previous ring, and each layer adds 8 more squares than the previous one.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) Ring:**\n   - Using the formula \\(a_n = 8n\\), substitute \\(n = 100\\):\n     \\[\n     a_{100} = 8 \\times 100 = 800\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of unit squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) ring is 800.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<800>>>"
