    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of getting exactly two heads in six tosses of a fair coin. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are tossing a fair coin six times. Each toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). We want to find the probability of getting exactly two heads in these six tosses.\n\n2. **Total Number of Outcomes**: Since each toss has two possible outcomes, the total number of possible sequences of heads and tails in six tosses is \\(2^6\\). Calculate this:\n   \\[\n   2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   So, there are 64 possible sequences of heads and tails.\n\n3. **Number of Favorable Outcomes**: We need to find the number of sequences that contain exactly two heads. This is a combinatorial problem where we choose 2 positions for heads out of 6 tosses. The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 6 is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\). Calculate this:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, there are 15 sequences that contain exactly two heads.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability of an event is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{15}{64}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Express the Answer**: The probability is already in its simplest form as a common fraction.\n\nThus, the probability that the sequence contains exactly two heads is \\(\\frac{15}{64}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<15/64>>>"
