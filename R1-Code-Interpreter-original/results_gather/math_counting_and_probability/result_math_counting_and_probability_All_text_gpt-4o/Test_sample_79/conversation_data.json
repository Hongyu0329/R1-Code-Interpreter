    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that three randomly selected sticks can form a triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, three lengths can form a triangle if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Ways to Select Three Sticks:**\n   We have 7 sticks, and we need to choose 3 of them. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check Which Combinations Can Form a Triangle:**\n   We need to check each combination of three sticks to see if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. The combinations are:\n\n   - (2, 3, 5): 2 + 3 = 5, which is not greater than 5. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 3, 7): 2 + 3 = 5, which is not greater than 7. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 3, 11): 2 + 3 = 5, which is not greater than 11. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 3, 13): 2 + 3 = 5, which is not greater than 13. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 3, 17): 2 + 3 = 5, which is not greater than 17. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 5, 7): 2 + 5 = 7, which is not greater than 7. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 5, 11): 2 + 5 = 7, which is not greater than 11. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 5, 13): 2 + 5 = 7, which is not greater than 13. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 5, 17): 2 + 5 = 7, which is not greater than 17. Cannot form a triangle.\n   - (2, 7, 11): 2 + 7 = 9, which is not greater than 11.

Can form a triangle.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Combinations That Can Form a Triangle:**\n   From the above analysis, the combinations that can form a triangle are:\n   - (3, 5, 7)\n   - (3, 11, 13)\n   - (5, 7, 11)\n   - (5, 11, 13)\n   - (5, 13, 17)\n   - (7, 11, 13)\n   - (7, 11, 17)\n   - (7, 13, 17)\n   - (11, 13, 17)\n\n   There are 9 combinations that can form a triangle.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   The probability that a randomly selected set of three sticks can form a triangle is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{9}{35}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a triangle can be formed by joining the endpoints of the sticks is \\(\\frac{9}{35}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<9/35>>>"
