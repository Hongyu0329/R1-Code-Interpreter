    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 4-letter words can be formed from the given letters (A, B, C, D, E) such that at least one of the letters is a vowel. The vowels in this set are A and E.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of 4-Letter Words:**\n   - We have 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E) to choose from, and each position in the 4-letter word can be filled by any of these 5 letters.\n   - Therefore, the total number of 4-letter words is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625\n     \\]\n\n2. **Number of 4-Letter Words with No Vowels:**\n   - If a word has no vowels, it can only be formed using the consonants B, C, and D.\n   - There are 3 consonants, and each position in the 4-letter word can be filled by any of these 3 consonants.\n   - Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with no vowels is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^4 = 81\n     \\]\n\n3. **Number of 4-Letter Words with At Least One Vowel:**\n   - To find the number of words with at least one vowel, we subtract the number of words with no vowels from the total number of words.\n   - Thus, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is:\n     \\[\n     625 - 81 = 544\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of 4-letter words that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E with at least one vowel is:\n\n<<<544>>>"
