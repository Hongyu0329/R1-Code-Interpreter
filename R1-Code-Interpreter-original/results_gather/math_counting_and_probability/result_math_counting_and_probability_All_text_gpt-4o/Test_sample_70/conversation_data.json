    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other in a row of 7 chairs. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Ways to Seat Mary and James:**\n   - There are 7 chairs, and Mary and James can sit in any of these chairs.\n   - The total number of ways to seat Mary and James is the number of ways to choose 2 chairs out of 7 for them, which is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{7}{2} \\).\n   - However, since Mary and James are distinct individuals, we must also consider the arrangements of them in the chosen chairs. Thus, for each pair of chairs, there are 2 possible arrangements (Mary in the first chair and James in the second, or vice versa).\n   - Therefore, the total number of ways to seat Mary and James is \\( \\binom{7}{2} \\times 2 = 21 \\times 2 = 42 \\).\n\n2. **Ways for Mary and James to Sit Next to Each Other:**\n   - If Mary and James sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single \"block\" or \"unit\" that occupies 2 consecutive chairs.\n   - There are 6 possible pairs of consecutive chairs in a row of 7 chairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), and (6,7).\n   - For each pair of consecutive chairs, there are 2 possible arrangements (Mary in the first chair and James in the second, or vice versa).\n   - Therefore, the number of ways for Mary and James to sit next to each other is \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Ways for Mary and James to Not Sit Next to Each Other:**\n   - The number of ways for Mary and James to not sit next to each other is the total number of ways to seat them minus the number of ways they sit next to each other.\n   - This is \\( 42 - 12 = 30 \\).\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is the number of favorable outcomes (ways they do not sit next to each other) divided by the total number of outcomes (total ways to seat them).\n   - Therefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{30}{42} \\).\n   - Simplifying this fraction, we get \\( \\frac{5}{7} \\).\n\nThus, the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is \\( \\frac{5}{7} \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<5/7>>>"
