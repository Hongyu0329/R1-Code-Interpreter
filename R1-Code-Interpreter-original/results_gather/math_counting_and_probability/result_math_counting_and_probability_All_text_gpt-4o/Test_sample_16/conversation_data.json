    "To solve the problem of finding how many two-digit numbers have a tens digit greater than the ones digit, we need to analyze the possible values for the tens and ones digits.\n\n1. **Identify the range of two-digit numbers:**\n   - Two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99.\n\n2. **Define the digits:**\n   - Let the tens digit be represented by \\( t \\) and the ones digit by \\( o \\).\n   - The condition given is \\( t > o \\).\n\n3. **Determine the possible values for \\( t \\) and \\( o \\):**\n   - The tens digit \\( t \\) can range from 1 to 9.\n   - The ones digit \\( o \\) can range from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Analyze each possible value of \\( t \\):**\n   - For each value of \\( t \\), determine the possible values of \\( o \\) such that \\( t > o \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the number of valid combinations for each \\( t \\):**\n   - If \\( t = 1 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0. (1 possibility)\n   - If \\( t = 2 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1. (2 possibilities)\n   - If \\( t = 3 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1, 2. (3 possibilities)\n   - If \\( t = 4 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3. (4 possibilities)\n   - If \\( t = 5 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. (5 possibilities)\n   - If \\( t = 6 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. (6 possibilities)\n   - If \\( t = 7 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. (7 possibilities)\n   - If \\( t = 8 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. (8 possibilities)\n   - If \\( t = 9 \\), then \\( o \\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. (9 possibilities)\n\n6. **Sum the possibilities:**\n   - Total number of two-digit numbers where the tens digit is greater than the ones digit is the sum of all possibilities:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of two-digit numbers in which the tens digit is greater than the ones digit is:\n\n<<<45>>>"
