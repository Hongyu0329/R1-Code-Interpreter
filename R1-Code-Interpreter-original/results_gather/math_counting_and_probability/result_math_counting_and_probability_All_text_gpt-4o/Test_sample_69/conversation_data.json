    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to distribute six identical books between the library and being checked out, with the condition that at least one book is in the library and at least one book is checked out.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Books**: There are 6 identical books.\n\n2. **Distribution Requirement**: We need to distribute these books into two groups: books in the library and books checked out. The condition is that neither group can be empty.\n\n3. **Possible Distributions**: Since the books are identical, the only thing that matters is the number of books in each group. We can represent the number of books in the library as \\( x \\) and the number of books checked out as \\( y \\), where \\( x + y = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Valid Combinations**: We need to find all pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that both \\( x \\geq 1 \\) and \\( y \\geq 1 \\). This means:\n   - \\( x = 1, y = 5 \\)\n   - \\( x = 2, y = 4 \\)\n   - \\( x = 3, y = 3 \\)\n   - \\( x = 4, y = 2 \\)\n   - \\( x = 5, y = 1 \\)\n\n5. **Counting the Combinations**: Each pair \\((x, y)\\) represents a unique way to distribute the books, given the condition that at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out.\n\n6. **Total Number of Ways**: Count the number of valid pairs from step 4. There are 5 such pairs.\n\nTherefore, the number of different ways to distribute the books such that at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out is 5.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
