    "To determine how many three-digit numbers there are, we need to consider the range of numbers that qualify as three-digit numbers. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Definition of a Three-Digit Number**: \n   - A three-digit number is any integer that has exactly three digits. \n   - The smallest three-digit number is 100.\n   - The largest three-digit number is 999.\n\n2. **Range of Three-Digit Numbers**:\n   - The range of three-digit numbers is from 100 to 999, inclusive.\n\n3. **Counting the Numbers**:\n   - To find the total number of three-digit numbers, we need to count all the integers from 100 to 999.\n   - This can be calculated by subtracting the smallest number in the range from the largest number in the range and then adding 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - The formula to calculate the number of integers in a range [a, b] is: \\( b - a + 1 \\).\n   - Applying this formula to our range: \\( 999 - 100 + 1 \\).\n\n5. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - \\( 999 - 100 = 899 \\).\n   - Adding 1 gives: \\( 899 + 1 = 900 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 900 three-digit numbers.\n\nFinal answer: <<<900>>>"
