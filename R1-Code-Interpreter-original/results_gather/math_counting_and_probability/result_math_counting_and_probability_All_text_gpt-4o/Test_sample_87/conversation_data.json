    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions given and determine the probability that the sum of the values on four dice is odd, given that the product of their values is even.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice Rolls:**\n   - Each die is a standard six-sided die with faces numbered 1 through 6.\n   - A product of the values is even if at least one of the dice shows an even number (2, 4, or 6).\n\n2. **Condition for Product to be Even:**\n   - The product of the values of the dice is even if at least one die shows an even number.\n   - The only way the product is odd is if all dice show odd numbers (1, 3, or 5).\n\n3. **Probability of Product Being Even:**\n   - Probability of a single die showing an odd number = 3/6 = 1/2.\n   - Probability of all four dice showing odd numbers = (1/2)^4 = 1/16.\n   - Therefore, the probability of the product being even = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\n4. **Condition for Sum to be Odd:**\n   - The sum of the values on the dice is odd if an odd number of dice show odd numbers.\n   - Possible scenarios for an odd sum with four dice: 1 die shows an odd number, or 3 dice show odd numbers.\n\n5. **Calculating Probability of Odd Sum Given Even Product:**\n   - **Case 1:** 1 die shows an odd number (3 odd, 1 even):\n     - Choose 1 die to be even: 4 ways.\n     - Probability of 1 die being even = 3/6 = 1/2.\n     - Probability of 3 dice being odd = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n     - Total probability for this case = 4 * (1/2) * (1/8) = 1/4.\n\n   - **Case 2:** 3 dice show odd numbers (1 odd, 3 even):\n     - Choose 3 dice to be odd: 4 ways.\n     - Probability of 3 dice being odd = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n     - Probability of 1 die being even = 1/2.\n     - Total probability for this case = 4 * (1/8) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\n   - Total probability of odd sum given even product = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.\n\n6. **Final Probability:**\n   - We need the probability of the sum being odd given that the product is even.\n   - Since the probability of the product being even is 15/16, and the probability of the sum being odd given the product is even is 1/2, the final probability is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the dice is odd given that the product is even is:\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
