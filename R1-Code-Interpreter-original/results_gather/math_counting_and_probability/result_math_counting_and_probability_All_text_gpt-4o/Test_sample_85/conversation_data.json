    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events happening in sequence: drawing a red marble first and then drawing a white marble second, without replacement.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first.\n- There are 3 red marbles and 5 white marbles, making a total of 8 marbles.\n- The probability of drawing a red marble first is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles.\n- Probability of drawing a red marble first = 3/8.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the probability of drawing a white marble second, given that the first marble drawn was red.\n- After drawing a red marble, there are now 7 marbles left in the bag (2 red and 5 white).\n- The probability of drawing a white marble second is the number of white marbles divided by the remaining total number of marbles.\n- Probability of drawing a white marble second = 5/7.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the combined probability of both events happening in sequence.\n- The probability of both events happening (drawing a red marble first and a white marble second) is the product of the probabilities of each event.\n- Combined probability = (3/8) * (5/7).\n\nStep 4: Perform the multiplication to find the final probability.\n- Combined probability = 15/56.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white is 15/56.\n\nFinal answer: <<<15/56>>>"
