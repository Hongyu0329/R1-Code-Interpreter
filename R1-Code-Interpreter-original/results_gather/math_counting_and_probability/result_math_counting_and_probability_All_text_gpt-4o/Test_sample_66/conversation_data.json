    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of outfit combinations and then subtract the number of combinations where all items are the same color.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Combinations:**\n   - You have 6 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 6 hats.\n   - Each item can be chosen independently of the others.\n   - Therefore, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of choices for each item:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ (shirts)} \\times 6 \\text{ (pants)} \\times 6 \\text{ (hats)} = 216 \\text{ total combinations}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations with All Items the Same Color:**\n   - There are 6 colors available.\n   - For each color, there is exactly 1 shirt, 1 pair of pants, and 1 hat.\n   - Therefore, there are 6 combinations where all items are the same color (one for each color).\n\n3. **Calculate Valid Combinations:**\n   - To find the number of valid outfit combinations (where not all items are the same color), subtract the number of invalid combinations (where all items are the same color) from the total combinations:\n     \\[\n     216 \\text{ (total combinations)} - 6 \\text{ (same color combinations)} = 210 \\text{ valid combinations}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of outfit choices where not all items are the same color is 210.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<210>>>."
