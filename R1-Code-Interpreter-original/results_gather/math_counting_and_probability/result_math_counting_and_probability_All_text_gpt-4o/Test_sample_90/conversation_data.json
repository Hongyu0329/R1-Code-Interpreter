    "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from rolling three standard six-sided dice equals 180. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have three dice, each with faces numbered from 1 to 6.\n   - We need to find the probability that the product of the numbers on the top faces of the three dice equals 180.\n\n2. **Factorize 180:**\n   - The prime factorization of 180 is \\(180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Possible Values for Each Die:**\n   - Each die can show a number from 1 to 6. We need to determine which combinations of these numbers can multiply to give 180.\n\n4. **List Possible Combinations:**\n   - We need to find combinations of \\(a, b, c\\) such that \\(a \\times b \\times c = 180\\).\n   - The possible values for each die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n5. **Check Combinations:**\n   - We need to check combinations of these numbers to see if their product equals 180.\n   - The possible combinations are:\n     - \\( (3, 6, 10) \\)\n     - \\( (5, 6, 6) \\)\n   - However, 10 is not a possible outcome on a die, so we discard (3, 6, 10).\n   - The only valid combination is (5, 6, 6).\n\n6. **Count Valid Permutations:**\n   - The combination (5, 6, 6) can be permuted in different ways:\n     - (5, 6, 6)\n     - (6, 5, 6)\n     - (6, 6, 5)\n   - There are 3 permutations of (5, 6, 6).\n\n7. **Calculate Total Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of outcomes when rolling three dice is \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\).\n\n8. **Calculate Probability:**\n   - The probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{3}{216} = \\frac{1}{72}\\).\n\n9. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that the product of the numbers on the three dice equals 180 is \\(\\frac{1}{72}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1/72>>>"
