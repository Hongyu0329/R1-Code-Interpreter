    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) within the rectangle satisfies the condition \\(x < y\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Rectangle:**\n   - The rectangle is defined by the vertices \\((0,0)\\), \\((3,0)\\), \\((3,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\).\n   - This rectangle has a width of 3 units (from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\)) and a height of 2 units (from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\)).\n\n2. **Equation of the Line \\(x = y\\):**\n   - The line \\(x = y\\) is a diagonal line that passes through the origin and has a slope of 1.\n   - Within the rectangle, this line starts at \\((0,0)\\) and ends at \\((2,2)\\) because the line \\(x = y\\) intersects the top boundary of the rectangle at \\(y = 2\\).\n\n3. **Region of Interest:**\n   - We are interested in the region where \\(x < y\\).\n   - This region is above the line \\(x = y\\) within the rectangle.\n\n4. **Determine the Area of the Region \\(x < y\\):**\n   - The line \\(x = y\\) divides the rectangle into two regions.\n   - The region where \\(x < y\\) is a right triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Area of the Triangle:**\n   - The base of the triangle is along the line \\(y = 2\\) from \\((0,2)\\) to \\((2,2)\\), which is 2 units long.\n   - The height of the triangle is along the line \\(x = 0\\) from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((0,2)\\), which is also 2 units.\n   - The area of the triangle is given by the formula for the area of a triangle: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Area of the Rectangle:**\n   - The area of the rectangle is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n7. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability that a randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) satisfies \\(x < y\\) is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle.\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{\\text{Area of Triangle}}{\\text{Area of Rectangle}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(x < y\\) for a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/3>>>"
