    "To determine how many positive four-digit integers are palindromes, we need to understand the structure of a four-digit palindrome. A four-digit palindrome has the form \"abba\", where:\n\n- The first digit 'a' is the same as the fourth digit.\n- The second digit 'b' is the same as the third digit.\n\nGiven this structure, let's analyze the possible values for each digit:\n\n1. **First Digit (a):**\n   - Since we are dealing with four-digit numbers, the first digit 'a' cannot be zero. It must be a positive digit from 1 to 9.\n   - Therefore, there are 9 possible choices for 'a'.\n\n2. **Second Digit (b):**\n   - The second digit 'b' can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n   - Therefore, there are 10 possible choices for 'b'.\n\n3. **Third Digit (b):**\n   - As mentioned, the third digit is the same as the second digit, so it doesn't add any new choices.\n\n4. **Fourth Digit (a):**\n   - The fourth digit is the same as the first digit, so it doesn't add any new choices.\n\nNow, to find the total number of four-digit palindromes, we multiply the number of choices for 'a' and 'b':\n\n- Number of choices for 'a' = 9\n- Number of choices for 'b' = 10\n\nThus, the total number of four-digit palindromes is:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 10 = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of positive four-digit integers that are palindromes is 90.\n\nFinal answer: <<<90>>>"
