    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the portion of the number line where a randomly selected point is closer to 4 than to 0. We will analyze the number line from 0 to 5.\n\n1. **Identify the midpoint between 0 and 4:**\n   - The midpoint between two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) on a number line is given by \\(\\frac{a + b}{2}\\).\n   - Here, \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 4\\).\n   - Midpoint = \\(\\frac{0 + 4}{2} = 2\\).\n\n2. **Determine the region where a point is closer to 4 than to 0:**\n   - A point \\(x\\) on the number line is closer to 4 than to 0 if the distance from \\(x\\) to 4 is less than the distance from \\(x\\) to 0.\n   - Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(|x - 4| < |x - 0|\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get: \\(|x - 4| < |x|\\).\n\n3. **Analyze the inequality \\(|x - 4| < |x|\\):**\n   - For \\(x < 2\\), \\(|x - 4| = 4 - x\\) and \\(|x| = -x\\).\n   - The inequality becomes \\(4 - x < -x\\), which simplifies to \\(4 < 0\\), a contradiction. Thus, no points less than 2 satisfy the inequality.\n   - For \\(x \\geq 2\\), \\(|x - 4| = x - 4\\) and \\(|x| = x\\).\n   - The inequality becomes \\(x - 4 < x\\), which is always true for \\(x \\geq 2\\).\n\n4. **Determine the interval where the point is closer to 4:**\n   - From the analysis, the point is closer to 4 than to 0 for \\(x \\geq 2\\).\n   - The interval on the number line is \\([2, 5]\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the probability:**\n   - The total length of the number line segment is from 0 to 5, which is 5 units.\n   - The length of the segment where the point is closer to 4 is from 2 to 5, which is \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) units.\n   - The probability is the length of the favorable segment divided by the total length: \\(\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected point is closer to 4 than to 0 is 0.6.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0.6>>>"
