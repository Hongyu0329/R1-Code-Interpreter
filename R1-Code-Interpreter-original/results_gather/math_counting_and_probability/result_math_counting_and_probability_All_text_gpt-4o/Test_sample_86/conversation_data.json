    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that both members chosen at random from the club are girls. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Members**: The club has a total of 10 members.\n\n2. **Number of Girls**: There are 5 girls in the club.\n\n3. **Choosing Two Members**: We need to choose 2 members out of the 10. The number of ways to choose 2 members from 10 is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n   \\]\n\n4. **Choosing Two Girls**: We need to choose 2 girls out of the 5 girls. The number of ways to choose 2 girls from 5 is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that both members chosen are girls is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 girls) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any 2 members):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 girls}}{\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 members}} = \\frac{10}{45}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Probability**: Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{45} = \\frac{2}{9}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that both members chosen are girls is \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<2/9>>>"
