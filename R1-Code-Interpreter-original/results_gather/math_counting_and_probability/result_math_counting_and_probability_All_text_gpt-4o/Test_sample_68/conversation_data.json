How many starting lineups (of 5 players) can Coach Yellsalot make, if the starting lineup can't contain both Bob and Yogi?

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can select a starting lineup of 5 players from a team of 12 players, with the restriction that Bob and Yogi cannot both be in the lineup at the same time.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Ways to Choose 5 Players from 12:**\n   - Without any restrictions, the number of ways to choose 5 players from 12 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of players, and \\( k \\) is the number of players to choose.\n   - So, the total number of ways to choose 5 players from 12 is \\( \\binom{12}{5} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( \\binom{12}{5} \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{12}{5} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 792\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ways to Choose 5 Players Including Both Bob and Yogi:**\n   - If both Bob and Yogi are in the lineup, we need to choose the remaining 3 players from the other 10 players (since Bob and Yogi are already chosen).\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 players from 10 is \\( \\binom{10}{3} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\( \\binom{10}{3} \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the Unwanted Lineups:**\n   - We subtract the number of lineups that include both Bob and Yogi from the total number of lineups.\n   - So, the number of valid lineups is \\( \\binom{12}{5} - \\binom{10}{3} = 792 - 120 = 672 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of starting lineups that Coach Yellsalot can make, without including both Bob and Yogi, is 672.\n\nFinal answer: <<<672>>>"
