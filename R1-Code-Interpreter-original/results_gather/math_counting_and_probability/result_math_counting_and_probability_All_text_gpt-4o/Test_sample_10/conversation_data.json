    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two balls drawn from the bag are of the same color. The process involves drawing a ball, recording its color, replacing it, and then drawing a second ball. The key here is that the draws are independent because the ball is replaced each time.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Total Number of Balls**: There are 6 green balls and 4 red balls, making a total of 10 balls in the bag.\n\n2. **Probability of Drawing Two Green Balls**:\n   - The probability of drawing a green ball on the first draw is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls: \\( \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6 \\).\n   - Since the ball is replaced, the probability of drawing a green ball on the second draw is also \\( \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6 \\).\n   - The probability of both balls being green is the product of the probabilities of each draw: \\( 0.6 \\times 0.6 = 0.36 \\).\n\n3. **Probability of Drawing Two Red Balls**:\n   - The probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls: \\( \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \\).\n   - Since the ball is replaced, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is also \\( \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \\).\n   - The probability of both balls being red is the product of the probabilities of each draw: \\( 0.4 \\times 0.4 = 0.16 \\).\n\n4. **Probability of Drawing Two Balls of the Same Color**:\n   - The probability of drawing two balls of the same color is the sum of the probabilities of both balls being green and both balls being red: \\( 0.36 + 0.16 = 0.52 \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the two balls drawn are of the same color is 0.52.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0.52>>>"
