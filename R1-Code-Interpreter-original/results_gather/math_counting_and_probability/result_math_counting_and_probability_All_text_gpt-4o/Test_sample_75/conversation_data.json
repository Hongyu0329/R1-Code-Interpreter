    "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the area of triangle \\(PBC\\) is less than half of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: \n   - We have a right triangle \\(ABC\\) with right angle at \\(C\\).\n   - The vertices are \\(A = (0, 5)\\), \\(B = (8, 0)\\), and \\(C = (0, 0)\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n   - Here, the base \\(BC = 8\\) and the height \\(AC = 5\\).\n   - So, the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Condition for Triangle \\(PBC\\)**:\n   - We want the area of triangle \\(PBC\\) to be less than half of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n   - Half of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(10\\).\n   - The area of triangle \\(PBC\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height from } P\\).\n   - The base \\(BC = 8\\), so the area of triangle \\(PBC\\) is \\(4 \\times \\text{height from } P\\).\n\n4. **Inequality for Triangle \\(PBC\\)**:\n   - We need \\(4 \\times \\text{height from } P < 10\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(\\text{height from } P < 2.5\\).\n\n5. **Geometric Interpretation**:\n   - The height from \\(P\\) to \\(BC\\) is the perpendicular distance from \\(P\\) to the line \\(BC\\).\n   - The line \\(BC\\) is the x-axis, so the height from \\(P\\) is simply the y-coordinate of \\(P\\).\n   - Therefore, we need the y-coordinate of \\(P\\) to be less than \\(2.5\\).\n\n6. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The triangle \\(ABC\\) is bounded by \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 8\\) and \\(0 \\leq y \\leq 5 - \\frac{5}{8}x\\).\n   - The region where \\(y < 2.5\\) is a smaller triangle within \\(ABC\\).\n   - The line \\(y = 2.5\\) intersects \\(AB\\) at some point. To find this point, solve \\(5 - \\frac{5}{8}x = 2.5\\).\n   - Solving gives \\(x = 4\\), so the point is \\((4, 2.5)\\).\n\n7. **Area of the Smaller Triangle**:\n   - The smaller triangle has vertices at \\(C = (0, 0)\\), \\((4, 2.5)\\), and \\((8, 0)\\).\n   - The base of this triangle is \\(8\\) and the height is \\(2.5\\).\n   - The area of this smaller triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 2.5 = 10\\).\n\n8. **Probability**:\n   - The probability is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n   - This is \\(\\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the area of triangle \\(PBC\\) is less than half of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/2>>>"
