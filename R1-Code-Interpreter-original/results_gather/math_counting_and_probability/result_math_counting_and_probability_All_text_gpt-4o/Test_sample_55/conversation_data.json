    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways there are to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can use the \"stars and bars\" method, which is a common combinatorial technique.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 5 indistinguishable balls.\n   - We have 2 distinguishable boxes.\n   - We need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls into the boxes.\n\n2. **Applying the Stars and Bars Method:**\n   - The problem can be visualized as finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n     \\[\n     x_1 + x_2 = 5\n     \\]\n     where \\(x_1\\) is the number of balls in the first box and \\(x_2\\) is the number of balls in the second box.\n\n3. **Using the Formula:**\n   - The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \\(x_1 + x_2 = n\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n     \\]\n     where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to distribute (balls), and \\(k\\) is the number of groups (boxes).\n   - In this case, \\(n = 5\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Ways:**\n   - Plug the values into the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{5 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{6}{1}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(\\binom{6}{1}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{1} = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are 6 ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
