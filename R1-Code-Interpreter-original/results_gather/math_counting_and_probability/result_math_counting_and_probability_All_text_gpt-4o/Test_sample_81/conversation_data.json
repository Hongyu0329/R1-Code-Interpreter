    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a green ball from the randomly chosen container. We will use the law of total probability to find the solution.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of containers and their selection probability:**\n   - There are three containers: A, B, and C.\n   - Each container is equally likely to be selected, so the probability of selecting any one container is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the probability of selecting a green ball from each container:**\n   - **Container A:** \n     - It contains 4 red balls and 6 green balls, making a total of 10 balls.\n     - The probability of selecting a green ball from container A is \\( \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\n   - **Container B:**\n     - It contains 6 red balls and 4 green balls, making a total of 10 balls.\n     - The probability of selecting a green ball from container B is \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n   - **Container C:**\n     - It also contains 6 red balls and 4 green balls, making a total of 10 balls.\n     - The probability of selecting a green ball from container C is \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total probability of selecting a green ball:**\n   - Use the law of total probability:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{green}) = P(\\text{green} | A) \\cdot P(A) + P(\\text{green} | B) \\cdot P(B) + P(\\text{green} | C) \\cdot P(C)\n   \\]\n   - Substitute the known probabilities:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{green}) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n   \\]\n   - Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{green}) = \\frac{3}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{7}{15}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the ball selected is green is \\( \\frac{7}{15} \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<7/15>>>"
