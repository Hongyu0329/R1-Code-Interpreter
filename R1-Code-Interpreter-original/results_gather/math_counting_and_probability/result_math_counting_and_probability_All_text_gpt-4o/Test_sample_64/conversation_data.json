    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of getting at most one tail when flipping \\( n \\) coins. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have \\( n \\) coins, each with two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).\n   - We are interested in the probability that at most one coin shows tails. This means either 0 tails (all heads) or 1 tail.\n\n2. **Probability of All Heads:**\n   - The probability of a single coin showing heads is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability of all \\( n \\) coins showing heads is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\).\n\n3. **Probability of Exactly One Tail:**\n   - To have exactly one tail, one coin shows tails and the remaining \\( n-1 \\) coins show heads.\n   - The probability of one specific coin showing tails is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and the probability of the remaining \\( n-1 \\) coins showing heads is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n-1} \\).\n   - There are \\( n \\) different coins that could be the one showing tails, so the probability of exactly one tail is \\( n \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n-1} = n \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\).\n\n4. **Total Probability of At Most One Tail:**\n   - The total probability of at most one tail is the sum of the probabilities of all heads and exactly one tail:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n + n \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\left(1 + n\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n   \\]\n\n5. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - We are given that this probability is \\( \\frac{3}{16} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + n\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\frac{3}{16}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - Rewrite the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 + n}{2^n} = \\frac{3}{16}\n   \\]\n   - Cross-multiply to clear the fraction:\n   \\[\n   16(1 + n) = 3 \\times 2^n\n   \\]\n   - Simplify:\n   \\[\n   16 + 16n = 3 \\times 2^n\n   \\]\n\n7. **Testing Values of \\( n \\):**\n   - We need to find an integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this equation. Let's test small values of \\( n \\):\n     - \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 16 + 16 \\times 1 = 32 \\), \\( 3 \\times 2^1 = 6 \\) (not equal)\n     - \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 16 + 16 \\times 2 = 48 \\), \\( 3 \\times 2^2 = 12 \\) (not equal)\n     - \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 16 + 16 \\times 3 = 64 \\), \\( 3 \\times 2^3 = 24 \\) (not equal)\n     - \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 16 + 16 \\times 4 = 80 \\), \\( 3 \\times 2^4 = 48 \\) (not equal)\n     - \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 16 + 16 \\times 5 = 96 \\), \\( 3 \\times 2^5 = 96 \\) (equal)\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
