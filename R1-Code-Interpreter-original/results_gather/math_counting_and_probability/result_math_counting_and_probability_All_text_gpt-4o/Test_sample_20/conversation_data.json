    "To determine how many 3-digit mountain numbers exist, we need to analyze the conditions that define a mountain number. A 3-digit number is represented as \\(abc\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are digits, and \\(a \\neq 0\\) since it is a 3-digit number.\n\nThe condition for a mountain number is that the middle digit \\(b\\) must be larger than both the first digit \\(a\\) and the last digit \\(c\\). Therefore, we need to find all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that \\(b > a\\) and \\(b > c\\).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Range of Digits:**\n   - \\(a\\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since \\(a\\) cannot be 0).\n   - \\(b\\) can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n   - \\(c\\) can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\n2. **Condition \\(b > a\\) and \\(b > c\\):**\n   - For each possible value of \\(b\\), determine the valid ranges for \\(a\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Valid Combinations:**\n   - For each \\(b\\) from 1 to 9 (since \\(b\\) must be greater than 0 to be greater than \\(a\\)), calculate the number of valid \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) values:\n     - \\(a\\) can range from 1 to \\(b-1\\).\n     - \\(c\\) can range from 0 to \\(b-1\\).\n\n4. **Count the Combinations:**\n   - For each \\(b\\), the number of valid \\(a\\) values is \\(b-1\\).\n   - For each \\(b\\), the number of valid \\(c\\) values is \\(b\\).\n   - Therefore, for each \\(b\\), the total number of combinations is \\((b-1) \\times b\\).\n\n5. **Sum Over All Possible \\(b\\):**\n   - Calculate the total number of mountain numbers by summing the combinations for each \\(b\\) from 1 to 9.\n\nLet's calculate the total:\n\n- For \\(b = 1\\): \\((1-1) \\times 1 = 0\\)\n- For \\(b = 2\\): \\((2-1) \\times 2 = 2\\)\n- For \\(b = 3\\): \\((3-1) \\times 3 = 6\\)\n- For \\(b = 4\\): \\((4-1) \\times 4 = 12\\)\n- For \\(b = 5\\): \\((5-1) \\times 5 = 20\\)\n- For \\(b = 6\\): \\((6-1) \\times 6 = 30\\)\n- For \\(b = 7\\): \\((7-1) \\times 7 = 42\\)\n- For \\(b = 8\\): \\((8-1) \\times 8 = 56\\)\n- For \\(b = 9\\): \\((9-1) \\times 9 = 72\\)\n\nNow, sum these values:\n\n\\[ 0 + 2 + 6 + 12 + 20 + 30 + 42 + 56 + 72 = 240 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of 3-digit mountain numbers is 240.\n\nFinal answer: <<<240>>>"
