    "To determine how many perfect squares are between 50 and 250, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Perfect Squares**: A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc., are perfect squares because they are 1², 2², 3², 4², respectively.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in perfect squares that are greater than 50 and less than 250.\n\n3. **Find the Smallest Perfect Square Greater than 50**:\n   - Calculate the square root of 50: \\(\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07\\).\n   - The smallest integer greater than 7.07 is 8.\n   - Therefore, the smallest perfect square greater than 50 is \\(8^2 = 64\\).\n\n4. **Find the Largest Perfect Square Less than 250**:\n   - Calculate the square root of 250: \\(\\sqrt{250} \\approx 15.81\\).\n   - The largest integer less than 15.81 is 15.\n   - Therefore, the largest perfect square less than 250 is \\(15^2 = 225\\).\n\n5. **List the Perfect Squares**:\n   - The perfect squares between 64 and 225 are the squares of the integers from 8 to 15.\n   - These integers are: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\n6. **Count the Perfect Squares**:\n   - The integers from 8 to 15 inclusive are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n   - There are 8 integers in this list.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 perfect squares between 50 and 250.\n\nFinal answer: <<<8>>>"
