    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the possible outcomes over two turns, starting with Alice having the ball. We will calculate the probability of each possible sequence of events that results in Alice having the ball after two turns.\n\n1. **Initial State: Alice has the ball.**\n\n2. **First Turn:**\n   - Alice can either keep the ball or toss it to Bob.\n   - Probability that Alice keeps the ball: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n   - Probability that Alice tosses the ball to Bob: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\n3. **Second Turn:**\n   - If Alice kept the ball in the first turn, she has another chance to either keep it or toss it to Bob.\n     - Probability that Alice keeps the ball again: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n     - Probability that Alice tosses the ball to Bob: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n   - If Bob has the ball (because Alice tossed it to him in the first turn), he can either toss it back to Alice or keep it.\n     - Probability that Bob tosses the ball to Alice: \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)\n     - Probability that Bob keeps the ball: \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of Alice having the ball after two turns:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Alice keeps the ball in both turns.\n     - Probability: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n   - **Scenario 2:** Alice tosses the ball to Bob, and Bob tosses it back to Alice.\n     - Probability: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\n5. **Total Probability:**\n   - Add the probabilities of the scenarios where Alice ends up with the ball:\n   - Total Probability = Probability of Scenario 1 + Probability of Scenario 2\n   - Total Probability = \\( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\n6. **Calculate the total probability:**\n   - Convert fractions to a common denominator:\n     - \\( \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{20} \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{20} \\)\n   - Add the fractions:\n     - Total Probability = \\( \\frac{5}{20} + \\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{9}{20} \\)\n\nTherefore, the probability that Alice has the ball again after two turns is \\( \\frac{9}{20} \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<0.45>>>"
