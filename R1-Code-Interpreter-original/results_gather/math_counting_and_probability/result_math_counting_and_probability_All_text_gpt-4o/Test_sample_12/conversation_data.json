    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 3-letter words can be formed using the letters A, B, C, and D, with the condition that the letter A must appear at least once in each word. Repetition of letters is allowed.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of 3-Letter Words Without Any Restrictions:**\n   - Each position in the 3-letter word can be filled by any of the 4 letters (A, B, C, or D).\n   - Therefore, the total number of 3-letter words is \\(4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 4^3 = 64\\).\n\n2. **Number of 3-Letter Words Without the Letter A:**\n   - If the letter A is not used, each position can only be filled by B, C, or D.\n   - Therefore, the number of 3-letter words without the letter A is \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^3 = 27\\).\n\n3. **Number of 3-Letter Words With the Letter A at Least Once:**\n   - To find the number of words with at least one A, we subtract the number of words without any A from the total number of words.\n   - Thus, the number of words with at least one A is \\(64 - 27 = 37\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of 3-letter words that can be formed using the letters A, B, C, and D, with the condition that the letter A appears at least once, is 37.\n\nFinal answer: <<<37>>>"
