    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Molly flips a fair coin five times and gets heads each time. We are asked to find the probability of flipping a tail on her next flip.\n\n2. **Properties of a Fair Coin**: A fair coin has two sides: heads (H) and tails (T). The probability of flipping heads is 1/2, and the probability of flipping tails is also 1/2.\n\n3. **Independence of Coin Flips**: Each flip of a fair coin is an independent event. This means that the outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of another flip. Therefore, the results of the previous five flips (all heads) do not influence the probability of the next flip.\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability of the Next Flip**: Since each flip is independent, the probability of flipping a tail on the next flip remains the same as it was for any single flip of a fair coin. This probability is 1/2.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The probability that Molly will flip a tail on her next flip is 1/2, regardless of the outcomes of the previous flips.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
