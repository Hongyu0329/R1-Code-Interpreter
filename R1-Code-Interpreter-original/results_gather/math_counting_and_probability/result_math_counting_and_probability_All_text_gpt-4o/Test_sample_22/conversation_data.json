    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many three-digit numbers have at least one digit that is either a 7 or a 9. We will use complementary counting to make this calculation easier.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Number of Three-Digit Numbers:**\n   - The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999.\n   - Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers is \\(999 - 100 + 1 = 900\\).\n\n2. **Complementary Counting:**\n   - Instead of directly counting the numbers with at least one 7 or 9, we will count the numbers that do not have any 7s or 9s and subtract this from the total.\n\n3. **Counting Numbers Without 7 or 9:**\n   - For a three-digit number, each digit can be one of the following: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (since we exclude 7 and 9).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Cannot be 0 (since it must be a three-digit number), so choices are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. This gives us 7 options.\n   - **Tens Place:** Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. This gives us 8 options.\n   - **Units Place:** Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. This gives us 8 options.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Three-Digit Numbers Without 7 or 9:**\n   - Multiply the number of choices for each digit: \\(7 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 448\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Three-Digit Numbers With at Least One 7 or 9:**\n   - Subtract the number of numbers without 7 or 9 from the total number of three-digit numbers: \\(900 - 448 = 452\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits is:\n\n<<<452>>>"
