    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that when six 6-sided dice are rolled, the number of dice showing even numbers is equal to the number of dice showing odd numbers. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice:**\n   - A 6-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.\n   - The odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5.\n   - Therefore, there are 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers on a die.\n\n2. **Total Outcomes:**\n   - Each die has 6 possible outcomes.\n   - With 6 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is \\(6^6\\).\n\n3. **Equal Even and Odd Numbers:**\n   - We want exactly 3 dice to show even numbers and 3 dice to show odd numbers.\n   - This is a binomial distribution problem where we choose 3 dice to show even numbers out of 6.\n\n4. **Calculating Combinations:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 dice to show even numbers out of 6 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\times (6-3)!} = 20\\).\n\n5. **Probability of Even or Odd on a Single Die:**\n   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single die is \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - Similarly, the probability of rolling an odd number is also \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n6. **Probability of a Specific Combination:**\n   - The probability of any specific combination of 3 even and 3 odd numbers is \\((\\frac{1}{2})^3 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^3 = (\\frac{1}{2})^6\\).\n\n7. **Total Probability:**\n   - Multiply the number of combinations by the probability of each specific combination:\n   - Total probability = \\(\\binom{6}{3} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^6 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{20}{64} = \\frac{5}{16}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal is \\(\\frac{5}{16}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<5/16>>>"
