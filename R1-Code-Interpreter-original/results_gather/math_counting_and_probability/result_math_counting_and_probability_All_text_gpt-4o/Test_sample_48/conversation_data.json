    "To find the sum of the numbers in Row 8 of Pascal's Triangle, we need to understand the properties of Pascal's Triangle.\n\n1. **Understanding Pascal's Triangle:**\n   - Each row in Pascal's Triangle represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion \\((a + b)^n\\).\n   - The sum of the numbers in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle is \\(2^n\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Row 8:**\n   - Row 8 corresponds to the 9th row if we start counting from Row 0.\n   - According to the property mentioned above, the sum of the numbers in Row 8 is \\(2^8\\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\(2^8\\):**\n   - \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the numbers in Row 8 of Pascal's Triangle is 256.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<256>>>."
