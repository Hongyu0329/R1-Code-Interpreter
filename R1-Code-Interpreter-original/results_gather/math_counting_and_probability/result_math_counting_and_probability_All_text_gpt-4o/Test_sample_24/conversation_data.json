    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 out of the 5 days Robert visits. This is a binomial probability problem, where we have:\n\n- The probability of success (bottling chocolate milk) on any given day, \\( p = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n- The probability of failure (bottling regular milk) on any given day, \\( q = 1 - p = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n- The number of trials (days Robert visits), \\( n = 5 \\).\n- The number of successes we are interested in, \\( k = 4 \\).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot q^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \\( \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n\nLet's calculate each component step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{5}{4}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{4! \\cdot (5-4)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4!}{4! \\times 1!} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( p^k \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   p^k = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16}{81}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\( q^{n-k} \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   q^{n-k} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{5-4} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine all parts to find \\( P(X = 4) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   P(X = 4) = \\binom{5}{4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 5 \\cdot \\frac{16}{81} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 5 \\cdot \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{80}{243}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 out of the 5 days is \\(\\frac{80}{243}\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<80/243>>>"
