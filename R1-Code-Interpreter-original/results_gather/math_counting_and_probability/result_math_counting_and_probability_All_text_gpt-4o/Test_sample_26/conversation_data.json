    "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from tossing three standard dice is equal to 1. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice:**\n   - A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6.\n   - When three dice are tossed, each die can independently land on any of these six numbers.\n\n2. **Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Each die has 6 possible outcomes.\n   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when three dice are tossed is \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\).\n\n3. **Condition for the Product:**\n   - We need the product \\(abc = 1\\).\n   - The only way for the product of three numbers to be 1 is if each of the numbers is 1, because 1 is the only number on a die that can multiply with itself to give 1.\n\n4. **Counting Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - For the product \\(abc = 1\\), each die must show a 1.\n   - Therefore, the only favorable outcome is when all three dice show 1.\n   - There is exactly 1 such outcome: (1, 1, 1).\n\n5. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - Probability is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n   - Number of favorable outcomes = 1.\n   - Total number of possible outcomes = 216.\n   - Therefore, the probability \\(P(abc = 1) = \\frac{1}{216}\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that the product of the numbers obtained from tossing three standard dice is 1 is \\(\\frac{1}{216}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1/216>>>"
