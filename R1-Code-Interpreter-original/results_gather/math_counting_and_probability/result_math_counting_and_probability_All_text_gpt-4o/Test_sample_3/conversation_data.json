    "To compute \\(\\binom{17}{9}\\), we can use the identity for binomial coefficients:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}\n\\]\n\nWe need to express \\(\\binom{17}{9}\\) in terms of known binomial coefficients. We can break it down as follows:\n\n1. \\(\\binom{17}{9} = \\binom{16}{8} + \\binom{16}{9}\\)\n\nWe don't have \\(\\binom{16}{8}\\) or \\(\\binom{16}{9}\\) directly, but we can express them in terms of \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\), \\(\\binom{15}{8}\\), and \\(\\binom{15}{9}\\).\n\n2. \\(\\binom{16}{8} = \\binom{15}{7} + \\binom{15}{8}\\)\n\n3. \\(\\binom{16}{9} = \\binom{15}{8} + \\binom{15}{9}\\)\n\nWe know \\(\\binom{15}{8} = 6435\\), but we need \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\) and \\(\\binom{15}{9}\\).\n\n4. \\(\\binom{15}{7} = \\binom{15}{8}\\) because \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\), so \\(\\binom{15}{7} = 6435\\).\n\n5. \\(\\binom{15}{9} = \\binom{15}{6}\\) because \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\), so \\(\\binom{15}{9} = 5005\\).\n\nNow, substitute these values back:\n\n6. \\(\\binom{16}{8} = 6435 + 6435 = 12870\\)\n\n7. \\(\\binom{16}{9} = 6435 + 5005 = 11440\\)\n\nFinally, compute \\(\\binom{17}{9}\\):\n\n8. \\(\\binom{17}{9} = \\binom{16}{8} + \\binom{16}{9} = 12870 + 11440 = 24310\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<24310>>>"
