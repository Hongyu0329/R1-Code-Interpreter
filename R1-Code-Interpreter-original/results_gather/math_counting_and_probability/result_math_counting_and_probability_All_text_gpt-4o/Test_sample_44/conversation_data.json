    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways there are to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, we need to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Indistinguishable Balls**: The balls are indistinguishable, meaning that the arrangement of balls in the boxes does not depend on which specific ball is in which box, only on the number of balls in each box.\n\n2. **Indistinguishable Boxes**: The boxes are also indistinguishable, meaning that swapping the contents of the boxes does not create a new arrangement.\n\n3. **Distribution of Balls**: We need to consider the different ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. The possible distributions of balls are:\n   - All 4 balls in one box and 0 in the other.\n   - 3 balls in one box and 1 in the other.\n   - 2 balls in each box.\n\n4. **Counting Distinct Arrangements**:\n   - For the distribution (4, 0), there is only 1 way to achieve this since the boxes are indistinguishable.\n   - For the distribution (3, 1), there is also only 1 way to achieve this because swapping the boxes does not create a new arrangement.\n   - For the distribution (2, 2), there is only 1 way to achieve this because both boxes have the same number of balls, making them indistinguishable.\n\n5. **Total Number of Ways**: We add up the distinct arrangements for each distribution:\n   - 1 way for (4, 0)\n   - 1 way for (3, 1)\n   - 1 way for (2, 2)\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to distribute the 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>."
