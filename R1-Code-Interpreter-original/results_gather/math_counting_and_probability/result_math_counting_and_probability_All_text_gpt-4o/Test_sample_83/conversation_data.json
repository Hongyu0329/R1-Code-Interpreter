    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that two different natural numbers selected from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 6\\}\\) have a greatest common factor (GCF) of 1. This means the two numbers are coprime.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to select two different numbers from the set.**\n\nThe set has 6 elements. The number of ways to choose 2 different numbers from 6 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: List all pairs of numbers and identify which pairs are coprime.**\n\nThe pairs of numbers we can choose are:\n- (1, 2)\n- (1, 3)\n- (1, 4)\n- (1, 5)\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 3)\n- (2, 4)\n- (2, 5)\n- (2, 6)\n- (3, 4)\n- (3, 5)\n- (3, 6)\n- (4, 5)\n- (4, 6)\n- (5, 6)\n\nNow, we check each pair to see if they are coprime (i.e., their GCF is 1):\n\n- (1, 2): GCF is 1\n- (1, 3): GCF is 1\n- (1, 4): GCF is 1\n- (1, 5): GCF is 1\n- (1, 6): GCF is 1\n- (2, 3): GCF is 1\n- (2, 4): GCF is 2\n- (2, 5): GCF is 1\n- (2, 6): GCF is 2\n- (3, 4): GCF is 1\n- (3, 5): GCF is 1\n- (3, 6): GCF is 3\n- (4, 5): GCF is 1\n- (4, 6): GCF is 2\n- (5, 6): GCF is 1\n\nThe coprime pairs are: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6).\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of coprime pairs.**\n\nThere are 11 coprime pairs.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability.**\n\nThe probability that two randomly selected numbers from the set are coprime is the number of coprime pairs divided by the total number of pairs:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of coprime pairs}}{\\text{Total number of pairs}} = \\frac{11}{15}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the greatest common factor of the two numbers is one is \\(\\frac{11}{15}\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<<<11/15>>>"
