    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' and do not contain the digit '5'. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Total number of three-digit integers**: \n   - Three-digit integers range from 100 to 999. \n   - Therefore, there are \\(999 - 100 + 1 = 900\\) three-digit integers in total.\n\n2. **Three-digit integers without the digit '5'**:\n   - For the hundreds place, the possible digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices, excluding 5).\n   - For the tens and units places, the possible digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (9 choices each, excluding 5).\n   - Therefore, the total number of three-digit integers without the digit '5' is \\(8 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 648\\).\n\n3. **Three-digit integers without the digit '5' and without the digit '3'**:\n   - For the hundreds place, the possible digits are 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (7 choices, excluding 3 and 5).\n   - For the tens and units places, the possible digits are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices each, excluding 3 and 5).\n   - Therefore, the total number of three-digit integers without the digits '5' and '3' is \\(7 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 448\\).\n\n4. **Three-digit integers with at least one '3' and without the digit '5'**:\n   - We use the principle of complementary counting. \n   - From the total number of three-digit integers without the digit '5' (648), we subtract those that also do not have the digit '3' (448).\n   - Therefore, the number of three-digit integers with at least one '3' and without the digit '5' is \\(648 - 448 = 200\\).\n\nThus, the number of positive, three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' as a digit but do not contain a '5' as a digit is:\n\n<<<200>>>"
