    "To find the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in the expansion of \\((x-1)^9\\), we can use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, we have \\(a = x\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(n = 9\\). We are interested in the term where the power of \\(x\\) is 8, which means we need to find the term where \\(n-k = 8\\).\n\n1. **Identify the term**: We need \\(n-k = 8\\), which implies \\(k = n - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Binomial Theorem**: The term in the expansion corresponding to \\(k = 1\\) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{1} x^{9-1} (-1)^1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the binomial coefficient**: \n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{1} = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the power of \\(-1\\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   (-1)^1 = -1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine the results**: The term is:\n\n   \\[\n   9 \\cdot x^8 \\cdot (-1) = -9x^8\n   \\]\n\n6. **Extract the coefficient**: The coefficient of \\(x^8\\) is \\(-9\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in the expansion of \\((x-1)^9\\) is \\(-9\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<-9>>>"
