    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of two independent events occurring: rolling a number less than three on the first die and rolling a number greater than three on the second die. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the possible outcomes for each die:**\n   - A six-sided die has outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n2. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number less than three on the first die:**\n   - The numbers less than three are 1 and 2.\n   - There are 2 favorable outcomes (1 and 2) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n   - Probability of rolling less than three on the first die = \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than three on the second die:**\n   - The numbers greater than three are 4, 5, and 6.\n   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n   - Probability of rolling greater than three on the second die = \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the combined probability of both events occurring:**\n   - Since the two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n   - Combined probability = \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that Nathan will roll a number less than three on the first die and a number greater than three on the second die is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/6>>>"
