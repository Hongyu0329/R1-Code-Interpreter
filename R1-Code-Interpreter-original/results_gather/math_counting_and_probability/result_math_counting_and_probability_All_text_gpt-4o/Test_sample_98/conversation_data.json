    "To solve the problem \\( \\frac{9!}{8!} \\) without using a calculator, we need to understand the concept of factorials and how they simplify in a fraction.\n\n1. **Understanding Factorials**: \n   - The factorial of a number \\( n \\), denoted as \\( n! \\), is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n   - For example, \\( 9! = 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Fraction**:\n   - We have the expression \\( \\frac{9!}{8!} \\).\n   - Notice that \\( 9! = 9 \\times 8! \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{9!}{8!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8!}{8!} \\).\n\n3. **Canceling the Common Factor**:\n   - Since \\( 8! \\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, it can be canceled out.\n   - This leaves us with \\( 9 \\).\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After canceling \\( 8! \\), the expression simplifies to just \\( 9 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
