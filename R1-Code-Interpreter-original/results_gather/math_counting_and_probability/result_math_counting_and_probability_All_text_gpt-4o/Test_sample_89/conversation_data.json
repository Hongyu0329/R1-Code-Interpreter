    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on, given the conditions of the problem. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements of Lamps:**\n   - Ryan has 3 red and 3 blue lava lamps. The total number of ways to arrange these 6 lamps in a row is given by the combination formula for arranging indistinguishable objects:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total arrangements} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\times 3!} = 20\n     \\]\n\n2. **Condition for the Leftmost Lamp:**\n   - The leftmost lamp must be blue and off. There are 3 blue lamps, and we need to choose 1 to be the leftmost. The remaining 5 lamps (2 blue and 3 red) can be arranged in any order:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ways to choose leftmost blue} = 3\n     \\]\n   - The remaining 5 lamps can be arranged in:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5!}{2! \\times 3!} = 10 \\text{ ways}\n     \\]\n   - Total ways with leftmost blue:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30\n     \\]\n\n3. **Condition for the Rightmost Lamp:**\n   - The rightmost lamp must be red and on. We need to consider the arrangements where the rightmost lamp is red. There are 3 red lamps, and we need to choose 1 to be the rightmost. The remaining 5 lamps (3 blue and 2 red) can be arranged in any order:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ways to choose rightmost red} = 3\n     \\]\n   - The remaining 5 lamps can be arranged in:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5!}{3! \\times 2!} = 10 \\text{ ways}\n     \\]\n   - Total ways with rightmost red:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combining Both Conditions:**\n   - We need to find the arrangements where the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on. We have already calculated the total arrangements for each condition separately, but we need to find the intersection of these conditions.\n   - The leftmost blue lamp is off, and the rightmost red lamp is on. We need to choose 2 more lamps to be on from the remaining 4 lamps (2 blue and 2 red). The number of ways to choose 2 lamps to be on is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The total number of favorable outcomes is the product of the ways to choose the leftmost blue, the ways to choose the rightmost red, and the ways to choose 2 more lamps to be on:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Favorable outcomes} = 3 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 54\n     \\]\n   - The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways to arrange the lamps and choose 3 to be on:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total possible outcomes} = 20 \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 20 \\times 20 = 400\n     \\]\n   - The probability is then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Probability} = \\frac{54}{400} = \\frac{27}{200}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on is:\n\n<<<0.135>>>"
