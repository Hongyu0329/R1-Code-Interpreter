    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two chips drawn from the bag are of different colors. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Chips:**\n   - Blue chips = 5\n   - Red chips = 4\n   - Yellow chips = 3\n   - Total chips = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12\n\n2. **Probability of Drawing Two Chips of the Same Color:**\n   - First, calculate the probability of drawing two chips of the same color.\n   - Probability of drawing two blue chips:\n     - Probability of first blue chip = 5/12\n     - Probability of second blue chip (after replacing the first) = 5/12\n     - Combined probability = (5/12) * (5/12) = 25/144\n\n   - Probability of drawing two red chips:\n     - Probability of first red chip = 4/12 = 1/3\n     - Probability of second red chip (after replacing the first) = 4/12 = 1/3\n     - Combined probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 = 16/144\n\n   - Probability of drawing two yellow chips:\n     - Probability of first yellow chip = 3/12 = 1/4\n     - Probability of second yellow chip (after replacing the first) = 3/12 = 1/4\n     - Combined probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 = 9/144\n\n3. **Total Probability of Drawing Two Chips of the Same Color:**\n   - Add the probabilities of drawing two chips of the same color:\n   - Total probability = 25/144 + 16/144 + 9/144 = 50/144\n\n4. **Probability of Drawing Two Chips of Different Colors:**\n   - The probability of drawing two chips of different colors is the complement of drawing two chips of the same color.\n   - Probability of different colors = 1 - Probability of same color\n   - Probability of different colors = 1 - 50/144 = 94/144\n\n5. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Simplify 94/144 by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 94 and 144, which is 2.\n   - Simplified fraction = (94 รท 2) / (144 รท 2) = 47/72\n\nTherefore, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is:\n\n<<<47/72>>>"
