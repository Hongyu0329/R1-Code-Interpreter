    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different combinations of sandwiches Alex can make given the constraints. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Choosing the Meat:**\n   - Alex has 10 different kinds of lunch meat.\n   - For each sandwich, he needs to choose 1 kind of meat.\n   - Therefore, there are 10 possible choices for the meat.\n\n2. **Choosing the Cheese:**\n   - Alex has 9 different kinds of cheese.\n   - He needs to choose 2 different kinds of cheese for each sandwich.\n   - The order in which he chooses the cheese does not matter, so we are dealing with combinations, not permutations.\n\n3. **Calculating Cheese Combinations:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 kinds of cheese from 9 is given by the combination formula: \n     \\[\n     \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( n = 9 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\).\n   - So, the number of combinations is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = 36\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating Total Sandwich Combinations:**\n   - For each choice of meat, there are 36 possible combinations of cheese.\n   - Since there are 10 choices for the meat, the total number of different sandwiches is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 36 = 360\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different sandwiches Alex can make is 360.\n\nFinal answer: <<<360>>>"
