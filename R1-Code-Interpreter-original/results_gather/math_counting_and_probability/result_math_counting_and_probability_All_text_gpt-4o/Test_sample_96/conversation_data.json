    "To solve the problem of finding how many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Range of Three-Digit Numbers:**\n   - The smallest three-digit number is 100.\n   - The largest three-digit number is 999.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Three-Digit Numbers:**\n   - Total three-digit numbers = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\n3. **Find the Number of Three-Digit Multiples of 5:**\n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 5 is 100.\n   - The largest three-digit multiple of 5 is 995.\n   - The sequence of multiples of 5 is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 100\\) and the common difference \\(d = 5\\).\n   - To find the number of terms, use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\times d\\).\n   - Set \\(a_n = 995\\) and solve for \\(n\\):\n     \\[\n     995 = 100 + (n-1) \\times 5 \\\\\n     995 - 100 = (n-1) \\times 5 \\\\\n     895 = (n-1) \\times 5 \\\\\n     n-1 = 179 \\\\\n     n = 180\n     \\]\n   - There are 180 three-digit multiples of 5.\n\n4. **Find the Number of Three-Digit Multiples of 7:**\n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 7 is 105.\n   - The largest three-digit multiple of 7 is 994.\n   - The sequence of multiples of 7 is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 105\\) and the common difference \\(d = 7\\).\n   - To find the number of terms, use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\times d\\).\n   - Set \\(a_n = 994\\) and solve for \\(n\\):\n     \\[\n     994 = 105 + (n-1) \\times 7 \\\\\n     994 - 105 = (n-1) \\times 7 \\\\\n     889 = (n-1) \\times 7 \\\\\n     n-1 = 127 \\\\\n     n = 128\n     \\]\n   - There are 128 three-digit multiples of 7.\n\n5. **Find the Number of Three-Digit Multiples of Both 5 and 7 (i.e., Multiples of 35):**\n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105.\n   - The largest three-digit multiple of 35 is 980.\n   - The sequence of multiples of 35 is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 105\\) and the common difference \\(d = 35\\).\n   - To find the number of terms, use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\times d\\).\n   - Set \\(a_n = 980\\) and solve for \\(n\\):\n     \\[\n     980 = 105 + (n-1) \\times 35 \\\\\n     980 - 105 = (n-1) \\times 35 \\\\\n     875 = (n-1) \\times 35 \\\\\n     n-1 = 25 \\\\\n     n = 26\n     \\]\n   - There are 26 three-digit multiples of both 5 and 7.\n\n6. **Apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   - The number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of either 5 or 7 is given by:\n     \\[\n     |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n     \\]\n   - Where:\n     - \\(|A|\\) is the number of multiples of 5 (180).\n     - \\(|B|\\) is the number of multiples of 7 (128).\n     - \\(|A \\cap B|\\) is the number of multiples of both 5 and 7 (26).\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     |A \\cup B| = 180 + 128 - 26 = 282\n     \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the Number of Three-Digit Numbers That Are Multiples of Neither 5 Nor 7:**\n   - Subtract the number of multiples of either 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers:\n     \\[\n     900 - 282 = 618\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is:\n\n<<<618>>>"
