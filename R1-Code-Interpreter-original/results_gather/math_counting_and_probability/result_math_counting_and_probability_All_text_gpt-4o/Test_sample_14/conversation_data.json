    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{ 3, 7, 21, 27, 35, 42, 51 \\}\\) is a multiple of 63. \n\nFirst, let's factor 63:\n\\[ 63 = 3^2 \\times 7 \\]\n\nFor a product to be a multiple of 63, it must include at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 7.\n\n**Step 1: Count the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set.**\n\nThe set has 7 elements. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct elements from 7 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[ \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify which numbers in the set are multiples of 3 and 7.**\n\n- Multiples of 3: \\(3, 21, 27, 42, 51\\)\n- Multiples of 7: \\(7, 21, 35, 42\\)\n\n**Step 3: Determine which pairs of numbers have a product that is a multiple of 63.**\n\nTo be a multiple of 63, the product must have at least two 3's and one 7. We will consider different cases:\n\n- **Case 1: One number is a multiple of 9 (i.e., \\(3^2\\)) and the other is a multiple of 7.**\n\n  - Numbers that are multiples of 9: \\(27\\)\n  - Numbers that are multiples of 7: \\(7, 21, 35, 42\\)\n\n  Possible pairs: \\((27, 7), (27, 21), (27, 35), (27, 42)\\)\n\n- **Case 2: One number is a multiple of 3 and the other is a multiple of 21 (i.e., \\(3 \\times 7\\)).**\n\n  - Numbers that are multiples of 3: \\(3, 21, 27, 42, 51\\)\n  - Numbers that are multiples of 21: \\(21, 42\\)\n\n  Possible pairs: \\((3, 21), (3, 42), (21, 27), (21, 42), (21, 51), (27, 42), (42, 51)\\)\n\n**Step 4: Count the valid pairs.**\n\nFrom Case 1, we have 4 pairs: \\((27, 7), (27, 21), (27, 35), (27, 42)\\).\n\nFrom Case 2, we have 7 pairs: \\((3, 21), (3, 42), (21, 27), (21, 42), (21, 51), (27, 42), (42, 51)\\).\n\nHowever, note that some pairs may overlap between the two cases. Specifically, \\((27, 21)\\) and \\((27, 42)\\) are counted in both cases. Therefore, we must ensure we do not double-count these pairs.\n\nThe total number of unique valid pairs is:\n\\[ 4 + 7 - 2 = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the probability.**\n\nThe probability that the product is a multiple of 63 is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\\[ \\frac{9}{21} = \\frac{3}{7} \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set is a multiple of 63 is \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<3/7>>>"
