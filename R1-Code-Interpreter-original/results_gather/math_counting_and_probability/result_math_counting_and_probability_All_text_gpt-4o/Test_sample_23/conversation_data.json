    "To determine how many different positive four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, we need to consider the permutations of these digits. Since there are repeated digits, we must account for these repetitions in our calculations.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of digits**: We have four digits: 2, 2, 9, and 9.\n\n2. **Calculate the total permutations without considering repetitions**: If all digits were unique, the number of permutations of four digits would be calculated as \\(4!\\) (4 factorial), which is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Account for repetitions**: Since the digits 2 and 9 are repeated, we need to divide by the factorial of the number of repetitions for each digit to avoid overcounting. \n\n   - The digit 2 is repeated twice, so we divide by \\(2!\\) (2 factorial), which is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n   - The digit 9 is also repeated twice, so we divide by another \\(2!\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the number of unique permutations**: The formula to calculate the number of unique permutations when there are repetitions is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: There are 6 different positive four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
