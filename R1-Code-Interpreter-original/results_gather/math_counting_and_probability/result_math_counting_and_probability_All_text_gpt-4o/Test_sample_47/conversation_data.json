    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the Lakers win the NBA finals in exactly 7 games. This means the series goes to the full 7 games, and the Lakers win the 7th game.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Series Format:**\n   - The NBA finals is a best-of-7 series. A team needs to win 4 games to win the series.\n\n2. **Probability of Winning a Single Game:**\n   - The probability that the Celtics win a single game is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability that the Lakers win a single game is \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Condition for the Series to Go to 7 Games:**\n   - For the series to go to 7 games, after 6 games, the series must be tied 3-3.\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability of a 3-3 Tie After 6 Games:**\n   - We need exactly 3 wins for the Lakers and 3 wins for the Celtics in the first 6 games.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 wins for the Lakers in 6 games is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\).\n   - The probability of any specific sequence of 3 Lakers wins and 3 Celtics wins is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 \\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Probability of the Lakers Winning the 7th Game:**\n   - The probability that the Lakers win the 7th game is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Combining the Probabilities:**\n   - The probability of the series being tied 3-3 after 6 games is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3\n     \\]\n   - The probability that the Lakers win the 7th game is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability that the Lakers win the series in exactly 7 games is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 \\times \\frac{1}{3}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Calculating the Final Probability:**\n   - Calculate \\( \\binom{6}{3} = 20 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27} \\).\n   - Calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27} \\).\n   - Combine these to find the probability:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times \\frac{1}{27} \\times \\frac{8}{27} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 20 \\times \\frac{8}{2187} = \\frac{160}{2187}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the Lakers win the NBA finals in exactly 7 games is \\( \\frac{160}{2187} \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\frac{160}{2187}>>>"
