    "To determine the maximum possible number of planes that can be formed by 12 points in space, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A plane is uniquely determined by three non-collinear points. Therefore, to form a plane, we need to select 3 points from the given set of points.\n\n2. **Combinatorial Selection**: The number of ways to choose 3 points from a set of 12 points is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of points, and \\( r \\) is the number of points to choose. Here, \\( n = 12 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Combinations**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n   \\]\n\n4. **Non-Collinearity Assumption**: The problem asks for the maximum number of planes, which implies that we assume no three points are collinear. If any three points were collinear, they would not form a plane. Therefore, under the assumption that no three points are collinear, every combination of 3 points will form a unique plane.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the assumption that no three points are collinear, the maximum number of planes that can be formed is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 points from 12, which is 220.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space is:\n\n<<<220>>>"
