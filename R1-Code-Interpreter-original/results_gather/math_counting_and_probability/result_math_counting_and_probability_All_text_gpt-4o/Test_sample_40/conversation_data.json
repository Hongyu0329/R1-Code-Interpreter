    "To solve this problem, we need to consider two main tasks: choosing six people out of seven and then arranging them around a circular table. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Choosing Six People:**\n   - We have seven people and need to choose six of them. The number of ways to choose six people from seven is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of people, and \\(k\\) is the number of people to choose.\n   - \\(\\binom{7}{6} = 7\\). This means there are 7 different groups of six people that can be chosen from the seven.\n\n2. **Arranging Six People in a Circle:**\n   - Once we have chosen six people, we need to arrange them around a circular table. The number of distinct ways to arrange \\(n\\) people in a circle is \\((n-1)!\\).\n   - For six people, the number of circular arrangements is \\((6-1)! = 5! = 120\\).\n\n3. **Considering Rotations:**\n   - In circular permutations, arrangements that are rotations of each other are considered the same. This is already accounted for in the formula \\((n-1)!\\) used above.\n\n4. **Combining the Two Steps:**\n   - We first choose the group of six people, which can be done in 7 ways.\n   - Then, we arrange these six people in a circle, which can be done in 120 ways.\n   - Therefore, the total number of distinct ways to choose and arrange the six people is \\(7 \\times 120 = 840\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<840>>>"
