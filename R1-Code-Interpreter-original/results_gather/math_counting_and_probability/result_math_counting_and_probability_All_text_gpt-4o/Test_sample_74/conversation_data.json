    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the number on the coin and the number on the die equals Erika's age, which is 14 years.\n\n1. **Understand the Components:**\n   - Erika flips a fair coin with sides labeled 10 and 20.\n   - She rolls a standard die with numbers 1 through 6.\n\n2. **Possible Outcomes for the Coin:**\n   - The coin can land on either 10 or 20. Since the coin is fair, each outcome has a probability of 1/2.\n\n3. **Possible Outcomes for the Die:**\n   - The die can show any number from 1 to 6. Each outcome has a probability of 1/6.\n\n4. **Calculate the Desired Sum:**\n   - We want the sum of the coin and die to equal 14.\n\n5. **Consider Each Coin Outcome:**\n   - **If the coin shows 10:**\n     - We need the die to show a number such that 10 + die = 14.\n     - Solving for the die, we get die = 14 - 10 = 4.\n     - The probability of rolling a 4 on the die is 1/6.\n\n   - **If the coin shows 20:**\n     - We need the die to show a number such that 20 + die = 14.\n     - Solving for the die, we get die = 14 - 20 = -6.\n     - Since -6 is not a possible outcome on a standard die, this scenario is impossible.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Probability:**\n   - The only successful scenario is when the coin shows 10 and the die shows 4.\n   - The probability of the coin showing 10 is 1/2.\n   - The probability of the die showing 4 is 1/6.\n   - Therefore, the probability of both events happening is (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12.\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that the sum equals Erika's age is 1/12.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1/12>>>"
