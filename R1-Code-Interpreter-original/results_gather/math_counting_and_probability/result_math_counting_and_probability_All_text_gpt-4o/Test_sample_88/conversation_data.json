    "To find the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle, we need to understand how Pascal's triangle is constructed and identify the smallest three-digit number within it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Pascal's Triangle:**\n   - Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients.\n   - Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.\n   - The rows are indexed starting from 0, and each row \\( n \\) has \\( n+1 \\) elements.\n\n2. **Binomial Coefficients:**\n   - The elements of Pascal's triangle are binomial coefficients, denoted as \\( C(n, k) \\), where \\( n \\) is the row number and \\( k \\) is the position in the row.\n   - The formula for a binomial coefficient is:\n     \\[\n     C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Smallest Three-Digit Number:**\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) such that \\( C(n, k) \\geq 100 \\) and \\( C(n, k) < 1000 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating Binomial Coefficients:**\n   - Start calculating binomial coefficients from the lower rows and move upwards until we find the first three-digit number.\n   - For small values of \\( n \\), calculate \\( C(n, k) \\) for \\( k = 0 \\) to \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Checking Each Row:**\n   - **Row 0:** \\( C(0, 0) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 1:** \\( C(1, 0) = 1, C(1, 1) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 2:** \\( C(2, 0) = 1, C(2, 1) = 2, C(2, 2) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 3:** \\( C(3, 0) = 1, C(3, 1) = 3, C(3, 2) = 3, C(3, 3) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 4:** \\( C(4, 0) = 1, C(4, 1) = 4, C(4, 2) = 6, C(4, 3) = 4, C(4, 4) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 5:** \\( C(5, 0) = 1, C(5, 1) = 5, C(5, 2) = 10, C(5, 3) = 10, C(5, 4) = 5, C(5, 5) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 6:** \\( C(6, 0) = 1, C(6, 1) = 6, C(6, 2) = 15, C(6, 3) = 20, C(6, 4) = 15, C(6, 5) = 6, C(6, 6) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 7:** \\( C(7, 0) = 1, C(7, 1) = 7, C(7, 2) = 21, C(7, 3) = 35, C(7, 4) = 35, C(7, 5) = 21, C(7, 6) = 7, C(7, 7) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 8:** \\( C(8, 0) = 1, C(8, 1) = 8, C(8, 2) = 28, C(8, 3) = 56, C(8, 4) = 70, C(8, 5) = 56, C(8, 6) = 28, C(8, 7) = 8, C(8, 8) = 1 \\)\n   - **Row 9:** \\( C(9, 0) = 1, C(9, 1) = 9, C(9, 2) = 36, C(9, 3) = 84, C(9, 4) = 126, C(9, 5) = 126, C(9, 6) = 84, C(9, 7) = 36, C(9, 8) = 9, C(9, 9) = 1 \\)\n\n6. **Identifying the Smallest Three-Digit Number:**\n   - From the calculations, the first three-digit number appears in row 9: \\( C(9, 4) = 126 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle is:\n\n<<<126>>>"
