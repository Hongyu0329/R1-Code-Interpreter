    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen ball from a set of 50 ping-pong balls, numbered 1 through 50, has a number that is a multiple of 5, a multiple of 7, or both. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. **Identify Multiples of 5:**\n   - The multiples of 5 within the range 1 to 50 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50.\n   - Count of multiples of 5: 10.\n\n2. **Identify Multiples of 7:**\n   - The multiples of 7 within the range 1 to 50 are: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49.\n   - Count of multiples of 7: 7.\n\n3. **Identify Multiples of Both 5 and 7 (i.e., Multiples of 35):**\n   - The multiples of 35 within the range 1 to 50 are: 35.\n   - Count of multiples of 35: 1.\n\n4. **Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:**\n   - Total count of numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 or both is given by:\n     \\[\n     |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - \\(|A|\\) is the count of multiples of 5: 10.\n     - \\(|B|\\) is the count of multiples of 7: 7.\n     - \\(|A \\cap B|\\) is the count of multiples of both 5 and 7 (multiples of 35): 1.\n\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     |A \\cup B| = 10 + 7 - 1 = 16\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability that a randomly chosen ball has a number that is a multiple of 5 or 7 or both is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.\n   - Total number of outcomes (total balls): 50.\n   - Probability:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Probability} = \\frac{|A \\cup B|}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{16}{50} = \\frac{8}{25}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the number on the selected ball is a multiple of 5 or 7 or both is \\(\\frac{8}{25}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<8/25>>>."
