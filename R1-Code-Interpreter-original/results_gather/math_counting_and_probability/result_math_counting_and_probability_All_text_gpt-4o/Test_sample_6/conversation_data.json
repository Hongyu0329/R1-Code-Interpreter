    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of rolling six standard six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have six dice, each with six faces numbered from 1 to 6. We want each die to show a different number, meaning we want all numbers from 1 to 6 to appear exactly once.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - Each die has 6 faces, so for six dice, the total number of possible outcomes is \\(6^6\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Favorable Outcomes**:\n   - We want each of the numbers 1 through 6 to appear exactly once. \n   - The number of ways to arrange six distinct numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is the number of permutations of these six numbers, which is \\(6!\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability**:\n   - The probability of rolling six distinct numbers is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n   - Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{6!}{6^6}\\).\n\n5. **Compute the Values**:\n   - Calculate \\(6!\\): \n     \\[\n     6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(6^6\\):\n     \\[\n     6^6 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 46656\n     \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - The probability is \\(\\frac{720}{46656}\\).\n   - Simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 720 and 46656.\n   - The GCD of 720 and 46656 is 144.\n   - Simplify the fraction:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{720 \\div 144}{46656 \\div 144} = \\frac{5}{324}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers with six six-sided dice is \\(\\frac{5}{324}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\(\\frac{5}{324}\\)>>>."
