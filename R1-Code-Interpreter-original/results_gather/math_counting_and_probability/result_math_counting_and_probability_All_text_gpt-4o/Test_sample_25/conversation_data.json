    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between points \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).\n\n1. **Understand the given conditions:**\n   - \\(AB = 3AD = 6BC\\).\n\n2. **Express the lengths in terms of a variable:**\n   - Let \\(AD = x\\).\n   - Then \\(AB = 3AD = 3x\\).\n   - Also, \\(AB = 6BC\\), so \\(BC = \\frac{AB}{6} = \\frac{3x}{6} = \\frac{x}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the positions of points \\(A\\), \\(D\\), \\(C\\), and \\(B\\):**\n   - \\(A\\) is at position 0.\n   - \\(D\\) is at position \\(x\\).\n   - \\(B\\) is at position \\(3x\\).\n   - Since \\(BC = \\frac{x}{2}\\), \\(C\\) is at position \\(B - BC = 3x - \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{6x}{2} - \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{5x}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the length of \\(\\overline{CD}\\):**\n   - \\(C\\) is at \\(\\frac{5x}{2}\\) and \\(D\\) is at \\(x\\).\n   - The length of \\(\\overline{CD}\\) is \\(\\frac{5x}{2} - x = \\frac{5x}{2} - \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{3x}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the probability:**\n   - The total length of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is \\(3x\\).\n   - The length of \\(\\overline{CD}\\) is \\(\\frac{3x}{2}\\).\n   - The probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is the ratio of the length of \\(\\overline{CD}\\) to the length of \\(\\overline{AB}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\frac{3x}{2}}{3x} = \\frac{3x}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3x} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1/2>>>."
