    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to divide 3 men and 4 women into two groups of two people and one group of three people, ensuring that each group contains at least one man and one woman. The groups of the same size are indistinguishable, which means we need to account for this in our calculations.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total People**: We have 3 men (M1, M2, M3) and 4 women (W1, W2, W3, W4), making a total of 7 people.\n\n2. **Group Requirements**: We need to form two groups of two people and one group of three people. Each group must have at least one man and one woman.\n\n3. **Forming Groups**:\n   - **Group of 3**: This group can have either 2 men and 1 woman or 1 man and 2 women.\n   - **Groups of 2**: Each of these groups must have 1 man and 1 woman.\n\n4. **Case Analysis**:\n   - **Case 1**: Group of 3 has 2 men and 1 woman.\n     - Choose 2 men from 3: \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) ways.\n     - Choose 1 woman from 4: \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\) ways.\n     - Remaining people: 1 man and 3 women.\n     - Form two groups of 2 from these 4 people, each with 1 man and 1 woman.\n     - Choose 1 woman for the first group of 2: \\(\\binom{3}{1} = 3\\) ways.\n     - The remaining 2 people automatically form the second group.\n     - Total for this case: \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 36\\) ways.\n\n   - **Case 2**: Group of 3 has 1 man and 2 women.\n     - Choose 1 man from 3: \\(\\binom{3}{1} = 3\\) ways.\n     - Choose 2 women from 4: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways.\n     - Remaining people: 2 men and 2 women.\n     - Form two groups of 2 from these 4 people, each with 1 man and 1 woman.\n     - Choose 1 man for the first group of 2: \\(\\binom{2}{1} = 2\\) ways.\n     - The remaining 2 people automatically form the second group.\n     - Total for this case: \\(3 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 36\\) ways.\n\n5. **Total Ways**: Add the number of ways from both cases.\n   - Total = 36 (Case 1) + 36 (Case 2) = 72 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different ways to place 3 men and 4 women into two groups of two people and one group of three people, with each group containing at least one man and one woman, is 72.\n\nFinal answer: <<<72>>>"
