    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of two distinct numbers selected from the set \\(\\{ 2, 4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 50 \\}\\) is a multiple of 100.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to select two distinct numbers.**\n\nThe set has 7 elements. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct elements from 7 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for the product to be a multiple of 100.**\n\nA number is a multiple of 100 if it has at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5 (since \\(100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2\\)).\n\n**Step 3: Identify numbers in the set with factors of 2 and 5.**\n\n- Factors of 2:\n  - \\(2 = 2^1\\)\n  - \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n  - \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n  - \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3^1\\)\n  - \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n  - \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n\n- Factors of 5:\n  - \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n  - \\(15 = 3^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n  - \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n  - \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n\n**Step 4: Find pairs whose product is a multiple of 100.**\n\nTo have a product that is a multiple of 100, the pair must have at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5.\n\n- Pairs that satisfy this condition:\n  - \\( (4, 50) \\): \\(4 = 2^2\\), \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^3 \\times 5^2\\)\n  - \\( (10, 20) \\): \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\), \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^3 \\times 5^2\\)\n  - \\( (10, 50) \\): \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\), \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^2 \\times 5^3\\)\n  - \\( (12, 50) \\): \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3^1\\), \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^3 \\times 5^2\\)\n  - \\( (20, 50) \\): \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\), \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^3 \\times 5^3\\)\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of successful outcomes.**\n\nThere are 5 pairs that result in a product that is a multiple of 100.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the probability.**\n\nThe probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{21}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set is a multiple of 100 is \\(\\frac{5}{21}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\frac{5}{21}>>>"
