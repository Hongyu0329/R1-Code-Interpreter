    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year.\n\n1. **Understanding the Die Rolls:**\n   - A fair six-sided die has faces numbered 1 through 6.\n   - Composite numbers on the die: 4 and 6.\n   - Prime numbers on the die: 2, 3, and 5.\n   - If Bob rolls a 1, he rolls again.\n\n2. **Probabilities of Rolling Each Type:**\n   - Probability of rolling a composite number (4 or 6): \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n   - Probability of rolling a prime number (2, 3, or 5): \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - Probability of rolling a 1: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n3. **Handling the Roll of 1:**\n   - If Bob rolls a 1, he rolls again. This means the effective probability of rolling a composite or prime number needs to be adjusted to account for the re-rolls.\n   - The probability of not rolling a 1 is \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\).\n   - The adjusted probability of rolling a composite number is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{18} \\).\n   - The adjusted probability of rolling a prime number is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{12} \\).\n\n4. **Expected Difference Calculation:**\n   - Let \\( X \\) be the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal (prime number).\n   - Let \\( Y \\) be the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal (composite number).\n   - The expected value of \\( X - Y \\) over 365 days is:\n     \\[\n     E[X - Y] = 365 \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{12} - \\frac{5}{18}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{12} - \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{15}{36} - \\frac{10}{36} = \\frac{5}{36}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the expected difference is:\n     \\[\n     365 \\times \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{1825}{36} \\approx 50.6944\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal is approximately 50.6944.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<50.6944>>>"
