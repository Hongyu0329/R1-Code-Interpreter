    "To find the expected value of our winnings after one flip of the coin, we need to consider the probability of each outcome and the corresponding winnings or losses.\n\n1. **Identify the outcomes and their probabilities:**\n   - The probability of flipping heads (H) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n   - The probability of flipping tails (T) is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the winnings or losses for each outcome:**\n   - If we flip heads, we win \\$3.\n   - If we flip tails, we lose \\$2.\n\n3. **Calculate the expected value:**\n   The expected value (EV) is calculated by multiplying each outcome's value by its probability and summing these products.\n\n   \\[\n   EV = (\\text{Probability of H} \\times \\text{Winnings for H}) + (\\text{Probability of T} \\times \\text{Winnings for T})\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the given values:\n\n   \\[\n   EV = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times (-2)\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the calculations:**\n   - Calculate the expected value for heads:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 = 1\n     \\]\n\n   - Calculate the expected value for tails:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{3} \\times (-2) = -\\frac{4}{3}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Sum the expected values:**\n   \\[\n   EV = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   To combine these, convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n   \\[\n   1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   So,\n   \\[\n   EV = \\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{4}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThe expected value of our winnings after one flip is \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\) dollars.\n\nFinal answer: <<<-\\frac{1}{3}>>>"
