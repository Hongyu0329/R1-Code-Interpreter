    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Sue picks two shoes of the same color and that one is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Shoes:**\n   Sue has 11 pairs of shoes, which means she has a total of 22 shoes (11 pairs Ã— 2 shoes per pair).\n\n2. **Total Ways to Pick Two Shoes:**\n   The total number of ways to pick any two shoes from the 22 shoes is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{22}{2} = \\frac{22 \\times 21}{2} = 231\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ways to Pick Two Shoes of the Same Color:**\n   We need to consider each color separately and calculate the number of ways to pick one left shoe and one right shoe of the same color.\n\n   - **Black Shoes:**\n     - There are 6 pairs of black shoes, so there are 6 left black shoes and 6 right black shoes.\n     - The number of ways to pick one left and one right black shoe is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\n   - **Brown Shoes:**\n     - There are 3 pairs of brown shoes, so there are 3 left brown shoes and 3 right brown shoes.\n     - The number of ways to pick one left and one right brown shoe is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n   - **Gray Shoes:**\n     - There are 2 pairs of gray shoes, so there are 2 left gray shoes and 2 right gray shoes.\n     - The number of ways to pick one left and one right gray shoe is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\n4. **Total Ways to Pick Two Shoes of the Same Color and Different Sides:**\n   Add up the ways for each color:\n   \\[\n   36 \\, (\\text{black}) + 9 \\, (\\text{brown}) + 4 \\, (\\text{gray}) = 49\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability Calculation:**\n   The probability that the two shoes picked are of the same color and one is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe is the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{49}{231}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   Simplify \\(\\frac{49}{231}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 49 and 231, which is 7:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{49 \\div 7}{231 \\div 7} = \\frac{7}{33}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Sue picks two shoes of the same color and that one is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe is \\(\\frac{7}{33}\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<7/33>>>"
