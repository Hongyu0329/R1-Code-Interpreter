    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the number of its diagonals.\n\n1. **Understanding the Formula for Diagonals:**\n   - For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides, the formula to calculate the number of diagonals is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n     \\]\n   - This formula arises because each vertex connects to \\( n-3 \\) other vertices to form a diagonal (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices), and since each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end), we divide by 2.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - According to the problem, the number of diagonals is subtracted from the number of sides, and the result is zero. This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     n - \\frac{n(n-3)}{2} = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - Start by eliminating the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:\n     \\[\n     2n - n(n-3) = 0\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     2n - n^2 + 3n = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -n^2 + 5n = 0\n     \\]\n   - Factor out \\( n \\):\n     \\[\n     n(-n + 5) = 0\n     \\]\n   - This gives two solutions:\n     \\[\n     n = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n = 5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Interpreting the Solutions:**\n   - \\( n = 0 \\) is not a valid solution because a polygon cannot have zero sides.\n   - Therefore, the only valid solution is \\( n = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - A polygon with 5 sides is a pentagon, and it satisfies the condition that the number of sides minus the number of diagonals equals zero.\n\nThus, the number of sides of the polygon is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
