    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) from the rectangular region satisfies the condition \\(x > 2y\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Region:**\n   - The rectangular region is defined by the vertices \\((0,0)\\), \\((2008,0)\\), \\((2008,2009)\\), and \\((0,2009)\\).\n   - This rectangle has a width of 2008 (from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 2008\\)) and a height of 2009 (from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2009\\)).\n\n2. **Equation of the Line \\(x = 2y\\):**\n   - The line \\(x = 2y\\) is a straight line with a slope of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - We need to find where this line intersects the boundaries of the rectangle.\n\n3. **Intersections with the Rectangle:**\n   - **Intersection with \\(y = 0\\):** \n     - At \\(y = 0\\), \\(x = 2 \\times 0 = 0\\). So, the point is \\((0, 0)\\).\n   - **Intersection with \\(y = 2009\\):**\n     - At \\(y = 2009\\), \\(x = 2 \\times 2009 = 4018\\). However, since the maximum \\(x\\) value in the rectangle is 2008, this point is outside the rectangle.\n   - **Intersection with \\(x = 2008\\):**\n     - At \\(x = 2008\\), \\(2y = 2008\\) implies \\(y = 1004\\). So, the point is \\((2008, 1004)\\).\n\n4. **Region of Interest:**\n   - The line \\(x = 2y\\) divides the rectangle into two regions.\n   - We are interested in the region where \\(x > 2y\\).\n   - This region is above the line \\(x = 2y\\) and within the rectangle.\n\n5. **Area Calculation:**\n   - The area of the entire rectangle is \\(2008 \\times 2009\\).\n   - The region where \\(x > 2y\\) is a trapezoid with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2008,0)\\), \\((2008,1004)\\), and \\((0,0)\\).\n   - The area of this trapezoid can be calculated by subtracting the area of the triangle below the line \\(x = 2y\\) from the total area of the rectangle.\n\n6. **Area of the Triangle:**\n   - The triangle below the line \\(x = 2y\\) has vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2008,1004)\\), and \\((0,1004)\\).\n   - The base of the triangle is 1004 (from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 1004\\)).\n   - The height of the triangle is 2008 (from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 2008\\)).\n   - The area of the triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1004 \\times 2008\\).\n\n7. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The area of the region where \\(x > 2y\\) is the total area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle.\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{\\text{Area of region where } x > 2y}{\\text{Total area of rectangle}}\\).\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Total area of the rectangle = \\(2008 \\times 2009\\).\n   - Area of the triangle = \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1004 \\times 2008\\).\n   - Area of the region where \\(x > 2y\\) = \\(2008 \\times 2009 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1004 \\times 2008\\).\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{2008 \\times 2009 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1004 \\times 2008}{2008 \\times 2009}\\).\n\n9. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   - Simplify the expression to find the probability in the form of a common fraction.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the probability that \\(x > 2y\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\frac{1}{2}>>>"
