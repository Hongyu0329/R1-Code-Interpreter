    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of three standard 6-sided dice is 16. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice and Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Each die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6.\n   - When rolling three dice, each die is independent, and the total number of possible outcomes is \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Desired Outcome:**\n   - We want the sum of the numbers on the three dice to be 16.\n\n3. **Determine the Combinations that Result in a Sum of 16:**\n   - The minimum sum with three dice is 3 (1+1+1), and the maximum sum is 18 (6+6+6).\n   - We need to find all combinations of three numbers (each between 1 and 6) that add up to 16.\n\n4. **List the Possible Combinations:**\n   - Since the maximum value for each die is 6, and we need a sum of 16, at least one die must show a 6.\n   - Consider the cases where one die shows 6:\n     - If one die is 6, the other two must sum to 10. Possible pairs are (4,6), (5,5), and (6,4).\n   - Consider the cases where two dice show 6:\n     - If two dice are 6, the third die must be 4 to make the sum 16.\n   - Therefore, the combinations are:\n     - (6, 6, 4)\n     - (6, 4, 6)\n     - (4, 6, 6)\n     - (6, 5, 5)\n     - (5, 6, 5)\n     - (5, 5, 6)\n\n5. **Count the Valid Combinations:**\n   - (6, 6, 4) can occur in 3 different ways: (6, 6, 4), (6, 4, 6), (4, 6, 6).\n   - (6, 5, 5) can occur in 3 different ways: (6, 5, 5), (5, 6, 5), (5, 5, 6).\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - There are 6 successful outcomes (3 from (6, 6, 4) and 3 from (6, 5, 5)).\n   - The probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: \\(\\frac{6}{216} = \\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that the sum of the face-up integers is 16 is \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1/36>>>"
