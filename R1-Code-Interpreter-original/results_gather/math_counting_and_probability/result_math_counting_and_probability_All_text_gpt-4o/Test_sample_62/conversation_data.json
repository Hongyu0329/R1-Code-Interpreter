    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the constraints and properties of the string of digits. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The first digit of the string is 1. This means the string starts with '1xxxx...'.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Divisibility**: Any two-digit number formed by consecutive digits within this string is divisible by either 19 or 31. This means that for any two consecutive digits \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_{i+1}\\), the number \\(10a_i + a_{i+1}\\) is divisible by 19 or 31.\n\n3. **Possible Two-Digit Numbers**:\n   - **Divisible by 19**: The two-digit numbers divisible by 19 are 19, 38, 57, 76, and 95.\n   - **Divisible by 31**: The two-digit numbers divisible by 31 are 31, 62, and 93.\n\n4. **Starting with 1**: Since the string starts with 1, the first two-digit number must be one of the numbers that start with 1 and is divisible by 19 or 31. The only such number is 19.\n\n5. **Building the Sequence**:\n   - Start with 19. The next number must start with 9 (the last digit of 19) and be divisible by 19 or 31. The possible numbers are 95 (divisible by 19) and 93 (divisible by 31).\n   - If we choose 95, the next number must start with 5. The only number starting with 5 and divisible by 19 or 31 is 57.\n   - If we choose 93, the next number must start with 3. The only number starting with 3 and divisible by 19 or 31 is 38.\n\n6. **Continuing the Pattern**:\n   - From 57, the next number must start with 7. The only number starting with 7 and divisible by 19 or 31 is 76.\n   - From 76, the next number must start with 6. The only number starting with 6 and divisible by 19 or 31 is 62.\n   - From 62, the next number must start with 2. The only number starting with 2 and divisible by 19 or 31 is 19, which brings us back to the start.\n\n7. **Cycle Identification**: The sequence 19, 95, 57, 76, 62 forms a cycle. This cycle repeats every 5 digits.\n\n8. **Length of the String**: The string is 2002 digits long. Since the cycle is 5 digits long, we need to determine the position of the last digit in the cycle:\n   - 2002 mod 5 = 2. This means the 2002nd digit corresponds to the 2nd digit in the cycle.\n\n9. **Determine the Last Digit**: The cycle is 19, 95, 57, 76, 62. The 2nd digit in this cycle is 9 (from 95).\n\nTherefore, the largest possible last digit in this string is 9.\n\nFinal answer: <<<9>>>"
