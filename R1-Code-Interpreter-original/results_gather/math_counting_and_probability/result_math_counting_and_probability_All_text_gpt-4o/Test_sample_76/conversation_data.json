    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times when rolling a fair six-sided die four times. This is a classic example of a binomial probability problem. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Parameters of the Binomial Distribution:**\n   - A binomial distribution is characterized by the number of trials \\( n \\), the number of successes \\( k \\), and the probability of success on a single trial \\( p \\).\n   - In this problem:\n     - The number of trials \\( n = 4 \\) (since the die is rolled four times).\n     - The number of successes \\( k = 3 \\) (since we want to roll the number 1 exactly three times).\n     - The probability of success on a single trial \\( p = \\frac{1}{6} \\) (since there is one favorable outcome, rolling a 1, out of six possible outcomes on a fair die).\n\n2. **Use the Binomial Probability Formula:**\n   - The probability of getting exactly \\( k \\) successes in \\( n \\) trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n     \\[\n     P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Binomial Coefficient:**\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3! \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1} = 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - Substitute the values into the binomial probability formula:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 3) = \\binom{4}{3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{1}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each part:\n     - \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{216}\\)\n     - \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^1 = \\frac{5}{6}\\)\n   - Combine these:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 3) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{216} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{1296} = \\frac{20}{1296}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the fraction:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20}{1296} = \\frac{5}{324}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times in four rolls of a fair six-sided die is \\(\\frac{5}{324}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5/324>>>"
