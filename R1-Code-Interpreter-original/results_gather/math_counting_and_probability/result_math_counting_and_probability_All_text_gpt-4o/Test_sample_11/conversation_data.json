    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to seat the Smith family's 4 sons and 3 daughters in a row of 7 chairs such that at least 2 boys are next to each other. We can approach this problem using complementary counting.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements**: \n   - First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange 7 people (4 sons + 3 daughters) in 7 chairs. \n   - This is simply the permutation of 7 people, which is \\(7!\\).\n\n2. **Arrangements with No Boys Together**:\n   - To find the number of arrangements where no two boys are next to each other, we can use the following approach:\n   - Arrange the 3 daughters first. There are \\(3!\\) ways to arrange the daughters.\n   - This creates 4 gaps (one before the first daughter, two between the daughters, and one after the last daughter) where the boys can be placed.\n   - We need to place the 4 boys in these 4 gaps such that no two boys are in the same gap. This is equivalent to choosing 4 gaps out of the 4 available, which is not possible without having at least one gap with more than one boy.\n   - Therefore, there are no valid arrangements where no two boys are next to each other.\n\n3. **Complementary Counting**:\n   - Since there are no arrangements where no two boys are next to each other, all arrangements must have at least two boys next to each other.\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to seat them such that at least two boys are next to each other is simply the total number of arrangements.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Arrangements**:\n   - The total number of arrangements is \\(7!\\), which is 5040.\n\nThus, the number of ways to seat the Smith family such that at least two boys are next to each other is 5040.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<5040>>>"
