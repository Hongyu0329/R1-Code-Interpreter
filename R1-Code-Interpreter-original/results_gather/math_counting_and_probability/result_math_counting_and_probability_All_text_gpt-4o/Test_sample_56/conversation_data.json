    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the division \\( r \\div k \\) results in an integer, given the constraints on \\( r \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Range of Values for \\( r \\) and \\( k \\)\n\n- \\( r \\) is an integer such that \\(-3 < r < 6\\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \\( r \\) are \\(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n- \\( k \\) is an integer such that \\(1 < k < 8\\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \\( k \\) are \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Possible Pairs \\((r, k)\\)\n\n- The number of possible values for \\( r \\) is 8.\n- The number of possible values for \\( k \\) is 6.\n- Therefore, the total number of possible pairs \\((r, k)\\) is \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine When \\( r \\div k \\) is an Integer\n\nFor \\( r \\div k \\) to be an integer, \\( r \\) must be divisible by \\( k \\). We will check each value of \\( k \\) and determine which values of \\( r \\) are divisible by \\( k \\).\n\n- **\\( k = 2 \\):** \\( r \\) must be even. Possible values: \\(-2, 0, 2, 4\\). (4 values)\n- **\\( k = 3 \\):** \\( r \\) must be a multiple of 3. Possible values: \\(0, 3\\). (2 values)\n- **\\( k = 4 \\):** \\( r \\) must be a multiple of 4. Possible values: \\(0, 4\\). (2 values)\n- **\\( k = 5 \\):** \\( r \\) must be a multiple of 5. Possible values: \\(0, 5\\). (2 values)\n- **\\( k = 6 \\):** \\( r \\) must be a multiple of 6. Possible value: \\(0\\). (1 value)\n- **\\( k = 7 \\):** \\( r \\) must be a multiple of 7. Possible value: \\(0\\). (1 value)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Favorable Pairs\n\nAdd up the number of favorable pairs for each \\( k \\):\n\n- For \\( k = 2 \\), there are 4 favorable pairs.\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), there are 2 favorable pairs.\n- For \\( k = 4 \\), there are 2 favorable pairs.\n- For \\( k = 5 \\), there are 2 favorable pairs.\n- For \\( k = 6 \\), there is 1 favorable pair.\n- For \\( k = 7 \\), there is 1 favorable pair.\n\nTotal number of favorable pairs = \\(4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12\\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability that \\( r \\div k \\) is an integer is the number of favorable pairs divided by the total number of pairs:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{12}{48} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the division \\( r \\div k \\) is an integer is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1/4>>>"
