    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that both balls drawn from the box are white. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Balls:**\n   - There are 5 white balls and 6 black balls in the box.\n   - Total number of balls = 5 (white) + 6 (black) = 11 balls.\n\n2. **Total Ways to Draw 2 Balls:**\n   - We need to calculate the total number of ways to draw 2 balls from 11 balls.\n   - This can be calculated using combinations: \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n   - Here, \\( n = 11 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n   - So, the total number of ways to draw 2 balls = \\( C(11, 2) = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{2 \\times 1} = 55 \\).\n\n3. **Ways to Draw 2 White Balls:**\n   - We need to calculate the number of ways to draw 2 white balls from the 5 white balls.\n   - Again, using combinations: \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n   - Here, \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n   - So, the number of ways to draw 2 white balls = \\( C(5, 2) = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\).\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The probability that both balls drawn are white is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{\\text{Number of ways to draw 2 white balls}}{\\text{Total number of ways to draw 2 balls}}\\).\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{10}{55} = \\frac{2}{11}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are white is \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<2/11>>>."
