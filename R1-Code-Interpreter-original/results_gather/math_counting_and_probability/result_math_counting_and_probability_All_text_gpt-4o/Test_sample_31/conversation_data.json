    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways Johnny can choose three different marbles from a set of seven different colored marbles, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter, which is the case here since choosing marbles is not dependent on the order in which they are selected.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Marbles**: Johnny has 7 different colored marbles.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Marbles to Choose**: Johnny wants to choose 3 marbles.\n\n3. **Use the Combination Formula**: The formula for combinations is given by:\n   \\[\n   C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n4. **Plug in the Values**: Here, \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\). So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 4!}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Factorials**:\n   - \\( 7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040 \\)\n   - \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n   - \\( 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24 \\)\n\n6. **Substitute and Simplify**:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{5040}{6 \\times 24} = \\frac{5040}{144}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Perform the Division**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5040}{144} = 35\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Johnny can choose three different marbles from his bag in 35 different ways.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<35>>>."
