    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze Pascal's Triangle and determine the probability that a randomly chosen element from the first 15 rows is 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Pascal's Triangle:**\n   - Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. The element in the \\(n\\)-th row and \\(k\\)-th column is given by \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\).\n   - The rows are indexed starting from 0. So, the first 15 rows are rows 0 through 14.\n\n2. **Identifying Elements that are 1:**\n   - In Pascal's Triangle, the first and last elements of each row are always 1. This is because \\(\\binom{n}{0} = 1\\) and \\(\\binom{n}{n} = 1\\) for any non-negative integer \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Counting the Total Number of Elements:**\n   - The number of elements in the \\(n\\)-th row is \\(n + 1\\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of elements in the first 15 rows (rows 0 through 14) is:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=0}^{14} (n + 1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 15\n     \\]\n   - This is the sum of the first 15 positive integers, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 \\times (15 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{15 \\times 16}{2} = 120\n     \\]\n\n4. **Counting the Number of 1s:**\n   - As established, each row has exactly two 1s (one at the beginning and one at the end), except for row 0, which has only one 1.\n   - Therefore, the total number of 1s in the first 15 rows is:\n     \\[\n     1 + 2 \\times 14 = 1 + 28 = 29\n     \\]\n   - The 1 in row 0 is counted once, and each of the other 14 rows contributes 2 ones.\n\n5. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - The probability that a randomly chosen element is 1 is the ratio of the number of 1s to the total number of elements:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{29}{120}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the value of the element chosen is 1 is \\(\\frac{29}{120}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<29/120>>>"
