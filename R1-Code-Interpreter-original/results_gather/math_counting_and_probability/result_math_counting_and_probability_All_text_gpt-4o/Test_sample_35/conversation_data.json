    "To find the expected value of a roll of an eight-sided die, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have an eight-sided die with faces numbered from 1 to 8. We need to calculate the expected value of a single roll.\n\n2. **Define Expected Value**: The expected value (EV) of a discrete random variable is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and then summing all these products.\n\n3. **List Possible Outcomes**: The possible outcomes when rolling the die are the numbers 1 through 8.\n\n4. **Determine Probabilities**: Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of landing face up. Therefore, the probability of each outcome is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate Expected Value**: \n   - Multiply each outcome by its probability:\n     - \\( 1 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{8} \\)\n     - \\( 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} \\)\n     - \\( 3 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} \\)\n     - \\( 4 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} \\)\n     - \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8} \\)\n     - \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} \\)\n     - \\( 7 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8} \\)\n     - \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} \\)\n\n6. **Sum the Products**: Add all the products together to get the expected value:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{5}{8} + \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{7}{8} + \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{36}{8}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the Sum**: Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{8} = 4.5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected value of a roll of the eight-sided die is 4.5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4.5>>>"
