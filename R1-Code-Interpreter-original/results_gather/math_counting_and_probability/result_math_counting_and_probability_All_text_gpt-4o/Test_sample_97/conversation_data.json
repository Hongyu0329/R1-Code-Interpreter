    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a cube, with each face painted either red or blue independently with a probability of 1/2, can be oriented such that all four vertical faces are the same color.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Colorings**: \n   - Each face of the cube can be either red or blue.\n   - There are 6 faces on a cube.\n   - Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n2. **Favorable Orientations**:\n   - We want the cube to be oriented such that the four vertical faces are the same color.\n   - For any given orientation, the cube has 1 top face, 1 bottom face, and 4 vertical faces.\n\n3. **Counting Favorable Colorings**:\n   - Consider the case where the four vertical faces are all red:\n     - The top and bottom faces can be either red or blue independently.\n     - So, there are \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) ways to color the top and bottom faces when the vertical faces are all red.\n   - Similarly, consider the case where the four vertical faces are all blue:\n     - Again, the top and bottom faces can be either red or blue independently.\n     - So, there are \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) ways to color the top and bottom faces when the vertical faces are all blue.\n\n4. **Total Favorable Colorings**:\n   - Since the cube can be oriented in such a way that the vertical faces are all red or all blue, we add the two cases:\n   - Total favorable colorings = 4 (all vertical faces red) + 4 (all vertical faces blue) = 8.\n\n5. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The probability that the cube can be oriented such that all four vertical faces are the same color is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings.\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that the painted cube can be placed on a horizontal surface so that the four vertical faces are all the same color is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/8>>>"
