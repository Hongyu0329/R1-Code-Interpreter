    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of 5 rolled 6-sided dice is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself, meaning it has more than two distinct positive divisors.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - Each die has 6 faces, so there are \\(6^5\\) total possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice. \n   - Calculate \\(6^5 = 7776\\).\n\n2. **Understanding Composite Numbers**:\n   - A composite number is any number that is not prime and greater than 1. \n   - The only numbers that are not composite (and greater than 1) are prime numbers.\n\n3. **Identifying Non-Composite Outcomes**:\n   - The only non-composite numbers greater than 1 are prime numbers.\n   - The smallest prime number is 2.\n   - The product of the numbers on the dice can only be a prime number if one of the dice shows a prime number and all others show 1. However, since 1 is not a face on a standard die, this scenario is impossible.\n   - Therefore, the only non-composite product is 1, which occurs when all dice show 1. But since 1 is not a face on a standard die, this scenario is also impossible.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since every possible product of the numbers on the dice (other than 1) is composite, the probability that the product is a composite number is 1.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of the dice is a composite number is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
