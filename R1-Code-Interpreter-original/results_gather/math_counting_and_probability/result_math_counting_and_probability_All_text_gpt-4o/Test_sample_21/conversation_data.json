    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that it is sunny on exactly one day of the four-day weekend. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - There is a 75% chance of rain each day, which means there is a 25% chance of sunshine each day (since the only other weather condition is sunny).\n   - We need to find the probability that it is sunny on exactly one day out of the four days.\n\n2. **Probability of Sunshine on One Day:**\n   - The probability of sunshine on a given day is 0.25.\n   - The probability of rain on a given day is 0.75.\n\n3. **Using the Binomial Probability Formula:**\n   - We can model this situation using a binomial distribution, where the number of trials \\( n = 4 \\) (the four days), the number of successes \\( k = 1 \\) (one sunny day), and the probability of success on each trial \\( p = 0.25 \\).\n   - The binomial probability formula is given by:\n     \\[\n     P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values, we have:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 1) = \\binom{4}{1} (0.25)^1 (0.75)^{4-1}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - Calculate the binomial coefficient: \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\( (0.25)^1 = 0.25 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( (0.75)^3 = 0.421875 \\).\n   - Multiply these values together:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 1) = 4 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.421875 = 0.421875\n     \\]\n\n5. **Expressing the Probability as a Fraction:**\n   - The decimal 0.421875 can be converted to a fraction. It is equivalent to \\(\\frac{27}{64}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that Paul and Yuri get the weather they want (sunny on exactly one day) is \\(\\frac{27}{64}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<27/64>>>"
