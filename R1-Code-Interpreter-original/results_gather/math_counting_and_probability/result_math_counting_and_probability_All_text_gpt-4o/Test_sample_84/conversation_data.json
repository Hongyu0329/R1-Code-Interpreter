    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways there are to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Distinguishable Balls and Indistinguishable Boxes**: \n   - We have 4 distinguishable balls, which means each ball is unique and can be identified separately.\n   - We have 2 indistinguishable boxes, meaning the boxes cannot be differentiated from one another.\n\n2. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - If the boxes were distinguishable, each ball would have 2 choices (either box 1 or box 2), leading to \\(2^4 = 16\\) ways to distribute the balls.\n   - However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, some of these distributions will be considered the same.\n\n3. **Counting Distinct Distributions**:\n   - We need to count the distinct distributions of balls into boxes, considering the indistinguishability of the boxes.\n   - The possible distributions of balls into the boxes can be categorized by the number of balls in one of the boxes (since the boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider one box):\n     - 0 balls in one box and 4 in the other.\n     - 1 ball in one box and 3 in the other.\n     - 2 balls in each box.\n   \n4. **Calculating Each Case**:\n   - **0 balls in one box and 4 in the other**: There is only 1 way to do this, as all balls must be in one box.\n   - **1 ball in one box and 3 in the other**: Choose 1 ball to be in one box, and the rest will automatically be in the other. There are \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\) ways to choose 1 ball.\n   - **2 balls in each box**: Choose 2 balls to be in one box, and the other 2 will be in the other box. There are \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways to choose 2 balls.\n\n5. **Summing the Distinct Distributions**:\n   - Add the number of ways for each case: \\(1 + 4 + 6 = 11\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes is 11.\n\nFinal answer: <<<11>>>"
