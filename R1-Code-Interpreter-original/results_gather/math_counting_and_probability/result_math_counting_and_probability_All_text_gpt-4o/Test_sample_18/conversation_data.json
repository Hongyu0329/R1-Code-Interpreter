    "To determine the probability that a six-digit integer formed by the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is divisible by 15, we need to consider the divisibility rules for 15. A number is divisible by 15 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.\n\n**Step 1: Divisibility by 5**\n- A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Since we do not have a 0, the last digit must be 5.\n- We have two 5s available, so the last digit can be 5 in multiple ways.\n\n**Step 2: Divisibility by 3**\n- A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n- The sum of the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is 24.\n- Since 24 is divisible by 3, any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 3: Total number of permutations**\n- The total number of permutations of the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is calculated by considering the repetition of the digit 5:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6!}{2!} = \\frac{720}{2} = 360\n  \\]\n  This accounts for the repetition of the digit 5.\n\n**Step 4: Permutations ending in 5**\n- To find the number of permutations where the number ends in 5, we fix one of the 5s as the last digit and permute the remaining five digits: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.\n- The number of permutations of these five digits is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5!}{1!} = 120\n  \\]\n  This accounts for the repetition of the remaining 5.\n\n**Step 5: Probability calculation**\n- The probability that a randomly arranged six-digit number is divisible by 15 is the ratio of favorable outcomes (numbers ending in 5) to the total number of outcomes:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{120}{360} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the integer is divisible by 15 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/3>>>"
