    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that exactly two out of four 20-sided dice show an even number. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice:**\n   - Each die is a 20-sided die with numbers from 1 to 20.\n   - There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 20) and 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 19) on each die.\n\n2. **Probability of Rolling an Even Number:**\n   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single die is 10/20 = 1/2.\n\n3. **Probability of Rolling an Odd Number:**\n   - Similarly, the probability of rolling an odd number on a single die is also 10/20 = 1/2.\n\n4. **Using the Binomial Distribution:**\n   - We are rolling four dice, and we want exactly two of them to show an even number.\n   - This is a binomial probability problem where:\n     - The number of trials (n) = 4 (since there are four dice).\n     - The number of successes (k) = 2 (since we want exactly two even numbers).\n     - The probability of success on each trial (p) = 1/2 (probability of rolling an even number).\n\n5. **Binomial Probability Formula:**\n   - The probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials is given by:\n     \\[\n     P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n     \\]\n   - For our problem:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4-2}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient:**\n   - \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\\)\n\n7. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - Substitute the values into the formula:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 2) = 6 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.375>>>"
