    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard six-sided dice are rolled. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice Roll**: Each die is a standard six-sided die, with faces numbered from 1 to 6. When two dice are rolled, there are a total of \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Defining the Random Variable**: Let \\(X\\) be the random variable representing the number of 1's obtained when two dice are rolled. The possible values of \\(X\\) are 0, 1, or 2.\n\n3. **Calculating Probabilities**:\n   - **Probability of 0 ones**: This occurs when neither die shows a 1. The probability that a single die does not show a 1 is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\). Therefore, the probability that neither die shows a 1 is \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}\\).\n   - **Probability of 1 one**: This occurs when exactly one die shows a 1. There are two scenarios: the first die shows a 1 and the second does not, or the second die shows a 1 and the first does not. The probability for each scenario is \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{36}\\). Since there are two such scenarios, the total probability is \\(2 \\times \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}\\).\n   - **Probability of 2 ones**: This occurs when both dice show a 1. The probability for this is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\n4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value \\(E(X)\\) is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = 0 \\times P(X=0) + 1 \\times P(X=1) + 2 \\times P(X=2)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the probabilities:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = 0 \\times \\frac{25}{36} + 1 \\times \\frac{10}{36} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{36}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E(X) = 0 + \\frac{10}{36} + \\frac{2}{36}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E(X) = \\frac{12}{36} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/3>>>"
