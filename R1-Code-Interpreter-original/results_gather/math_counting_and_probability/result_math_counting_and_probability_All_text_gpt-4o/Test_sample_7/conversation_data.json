    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle from a 2 by 2003 rectangle does not include a shaded square. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Shaded Squares:**\n   - The rectangle is 2 rows by 2003 columns.\n   - The middle unit square of each row is shaded. Since there are 2003 columns, the middle column is the 1002nd column (since 2003/2 = 1001.5, we round up to 1002).\n\n2. **Total Number of Rectangles:**\n   - A rectangle can be defined by choosing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n   - There are 3 horizontal lines (top, middle, bottom) and 2004 vertical lines (since there are 2003 columns, there are 2003 + 1 = 2004 vertical lines).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines from 3 is \\( \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \\).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from 2004 is \\( \\binom{2004}{2} = \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2} = 2006010 \\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of rectangles is \\( 3 \\times 2006010 = 6018030 \\).\n\n3. **Rectangles Not Including the Shaded Square:**\n   - To avoid the shaded square, a rectangle must not include the 1002nd column.\n   - Consider the columns to the left of the 1002nd column (1 to 1001) and the columns to the right (1003 to 2003).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from the first 1001 columns is \\( \\binom{1002}{2} = \\frac{1002 \\times 1001}{2} = 501501 \\).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from the last 1001 columns is also \\( \\binom{1002}{2} = 501501 \\).\n   - Therefore, the number of rectangles that do not include the shaded square is \\( 3 \\times (501501 + 501501) = 3 \\times 1003002 = 3009006 \\).\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does not include a shaded square is the number of rectangles not including the shaded square divided by the total number of rectangles.\n   - This probability is \\( \\frac{3009006}{6018030} \\).\n\n5. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Simplify \\( \\frac{3009006}{6018030} \\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3009006 and 6018030.\n   - The GCD of 3009006 and 6018030 is 2.\n   - Therefore, the simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{3009006 \\div 2}{6018030 \\div 2} = \\frac{1504503}{3009015} \\).\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does not include a shaded square is:\n\n<<<\\frac{1504503}{3009015}>>>"
