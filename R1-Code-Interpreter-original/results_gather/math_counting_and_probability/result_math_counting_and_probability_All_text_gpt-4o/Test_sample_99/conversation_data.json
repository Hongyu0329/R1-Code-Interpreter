    "To find the expected value of the roll of a fair octahedral die, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have an octahedral die, which means it has 8 faces. Each face is numbered from 1 to 8. The die is fair, meaning each face has an equal probability of landing face up.\n\n2. **Define the Random Variable**: Let \\( X \\) be the random variable representing the outcome of a roll of the die. The possible values of \\( X \\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n3. **Determine the Probability Distribution**: Since the die is fair, the probability of each outcome is equal. Therefore, the probability \\( P(X = x) \\) for each \\( x \\) in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\} is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Expected Value**: The expected value \\( E(X) \\) of a discrete random variable is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = \\sum_{x} x \\cdot P(X = x)\n   \\]\n   For our die, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Calculation**: Factor out the common probability:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = \\frac{1}{8} (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers from 1 to 8:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36\n   \\]\n\n7. **Compute the Expected Value**: Substitute the sum back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   E(X) = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 36 = 4.5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the roll of a fair octahedral die is 4.5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4.5>>>"
