    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways there are to put 5 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 5 balls, each of which is distinguishable. This means each ball is unique and can be identified separately. We also have 2 boxes, and these boxes are distinguishable, meaning each box is unique and can be identified separately.\n\n2. **Determine the Choices for Each Ball**: Since each ball is distinguishable and each box is distinguishable, for each ball, we have 2 choices: it can either go into Box 1 or Box 2.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Ways**: Since the choice for each ball is independent of the others, we can multiply the number of choices for each ball. For the first ball, there are 2 choices (Box 1 or Box 2). The same applies to the second ball, the third ball, the fourth ball, and the fifth ball. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Result**: Calculate \\(2^5\\):\n   \\[\n   2^5 = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, there are 32 different ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<32>>>"
