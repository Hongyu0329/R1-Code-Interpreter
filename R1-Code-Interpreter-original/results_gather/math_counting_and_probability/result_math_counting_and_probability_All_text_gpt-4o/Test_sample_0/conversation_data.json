    "To solve the expression \\(9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1\\), we will evaluate each term step by step and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(9^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   9^3 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9\n   \\]\n   First, calculate \\(9 \\times 9 = 81\\).\n   Then, multiply the result by 9: \\(81 \\times 9 = 729\\).\n   So, \\(9^3 = 729\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(3(9^2)\\):**\n   \\[\n   9^2 = 9 \\times 9 = 81\n   \\]\n   Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 81 = 243\\).\n   So, \\(3(9^2) = 243\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(3(9)\\):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 9 = 27\n   \\]\n   So, \\(3(9) = 27\\).\n\n4. **The constant term is 1.**\n\n5. **Sum all the terms:**\n   \\[\n   9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1 = 729 + 243 + 27 + 1\n   \\]\n   First, add \\(729 + 243 = 972\\).\n   Then, add \\(972 + 27 = 999\\).\n   Finally, add \\(999 + 1 = 1000\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 1000.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1000>>>."
