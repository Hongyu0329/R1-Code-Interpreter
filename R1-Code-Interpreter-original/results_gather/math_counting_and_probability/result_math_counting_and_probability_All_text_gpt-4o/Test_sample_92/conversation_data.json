    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different combinations of apples and oranges can be placed in a fruit basket, given that each basket must contain at least one piece of fruit. The apples and oranges are identical within their respective types, so the order in which they are placed in the basket does not matter.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the possible number of apples in a basket:**\n   - Since there are 5 identical apples, the number of apples in a basket can range from 0 to 5.\n\n2. **Identify the possible number of oranges in a basket:**\n   - Since there are 10 identical oranges, the number of oranges in a basket can range from 0 to 10.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of combinations:**\n   - For each possible number of apples (0 to 5), there are 11 possible numbers of oranges (0 to 10).\n   - Therefore, the total number of combinations of apples and oranges is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for apples by the number of choices for oranges: \\( (5 + 1) \\times (10 + 1) = 6 \\times 11 = 66 \\).\n\n4. **Subtract the case where there is no fruit in the basket:**\n   - The problem states that a fruit basket must contain at least one piece of fruit. Therefore, we must subtract the one case where there are 0 apples and 0 oranges.\n   - This leaves us with \\( 66 - 1 = 65 \\) valid combinations.\n\nThus, the number of different kinds of fruit baskets that can be made, each containing at least one piece of fruit, is 65.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<65>>>."
