    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing two red marbles from the jar without replacement. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Marbles:**\n   - Red marbles: 2\n   - Green marbles: 3\n   - White marbles: 10\n   - Total marbles = 2 (red) + 3 (green) + 10 (white) = 15 marbles\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Ways to Draw Two Marbles:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 15 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose.\n   - C(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15-2)!) = (15 × 14) / (2 × 1) = 105 ways\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Draw Two Red Marbles:**\n   - Since there are only 2 red marbles, the number of ways to choose 2 red marbles from 2 is:\n   - C(2, 2) = 2! / (2!(2-2)!) = 1 way\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability of both marbles being red is the number of favorable outcomes (drawing 2 red marbles) divided by the total number of outcomes (drawing any 2 marbles).\n   - Probability = Number of ways to draw 2 red marbles / Total number of ways to draw 2 marbles\n   - Probability = 1 / 105\n\nTherefore, the probability that both marbles drawn will be red is 1/105.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/105>>>"
