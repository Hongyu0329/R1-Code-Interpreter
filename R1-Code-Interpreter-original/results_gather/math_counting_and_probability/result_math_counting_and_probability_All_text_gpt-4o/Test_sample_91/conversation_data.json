    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can choose 6 starters from the volleyball team, given that all three triplets (Alicia, Amanda, and Anna) must be included in the starting lineup.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Players:**\n   - The team has a total of 14 players.\n\n2. **Triplets Requirement:**\n   - The triplets Alicia, Amanda, and Anna must be included in the starting lineup. This means that 3 of the 6 starting positions are already filled by these triplets.\n\n3. **Determine Remaining Positions:**\n   - Since 3 positions are filled by the triplets, we need to choose 3 more players to complete the starting lineup of 6 players.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Players Available for the Remaining Positions:**\n   - Excluding the triplets, there are 14 - 3 = 11 players left on the team.\n\n5. **Choose the Remaining Players:**\n   - We need to choose 3 players from the remaining 11 players. The number of ways to choose 3 players from 11 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{r} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n6. **Apply the Combination Formula:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 players from 11 is \\( \\binom{11}{3} \\).\n\n7. **Calculate \\( \\binom{11}{3} \\):**\n   - The formula for combinations is \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\).\n   - Applying this to our problem: \n     \\[\n     \\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 165\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose 6 starters with all three triplets included is 165.\n\nFinal answer: <<<165>>>"
