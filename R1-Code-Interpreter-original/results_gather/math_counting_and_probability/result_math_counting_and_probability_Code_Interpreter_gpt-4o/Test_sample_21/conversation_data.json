Paul and Yuri want it to be sunny one of those days for a World War III preenactment, but if it's sunny for more than one day they won't know what to do with themselves.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that it is sunny on exactly one day out of the four-day weekend.\n\nGiven:\n- Probability of rain on any given day = 75% = 0.75\n- Probability of sunny weather on any given day = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n\nWe want exactly one sunny day out of four days. This is a binomial probability problem where:\n- Number of trials (n) = 4\n- Number of successes (k) = 1 (one sunny day)\n- Probability of success on a single trial (p) = 0.25\n\nThe probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Given values\nn = 4  # number of days\nk = 1  # exactly one sunny day\np = 0.25  # probability of a sunny day\n\n# Calculate the probability using the binomial formula\nprobability = comb(n, k) * (p ** k) * ((1 - p) ** (n - k))\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that Paul and Yuri get exactly one sunny day during the four-day weekend is \\( \\frac{27}{64} \\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<27/64>>>."
