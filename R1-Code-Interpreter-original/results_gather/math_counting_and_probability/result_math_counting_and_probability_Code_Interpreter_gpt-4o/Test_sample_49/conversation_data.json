    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of 5 rolled 6-sided dice is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself, meaning it has more than two distinct positive divisors.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible outcomes:\n\n1. Each die can show a number from 1 to 6.\n2. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice is \\(6^5\\).\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of outcomes where the product is a composite number. The complementary event is that the product is a prime number or 1. \n\n- The product can be 1 only if all dice show 1, which is one outcome.\n- The product can be a prime number if one die shows a prime number (2, 3, or 5) and all other dice show 1.\n\nLet's calculate the number of outcomes where the product is not composite (i.e., it is 1 or a prime number) and subtract it from the total number of outcomes to find the number of composite outcomes. Then, we can calculate the probability.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Total number of outcomes when rolling 5 dice\ntotal_outcomes = 6**5\n\n# Possible numbers on a die\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Function to check if a number is composite\ndef is_composite(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Count the number of composite outcomes\ncomposite_count = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor outcome in product(numbers, repeat=5):\n    product_value = 1\n    for num in outcome:\n        product_value *= num\n    if is_composite(product_value):\n        composite_count += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability_composite = composite_count / total_outcomes\nprobability_composite\nassistant > The probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of 5 rolled 6-sided dice is a composite number is approximately 0.9979423868312757.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.9979423868312757>>>"
