    "\nassistant > To find the probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white, we can use the concept of conditional probability.\n\n1. **Probability of drawing a red marble first:**\n   - There are 3 red marbles out of a total of 8 marbles.\n   - Probability = \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)\n\n2. **Probability of drawing a white marble second, given that the first marble was red:**\n   - After drawing a red marble, there are 7 marbles left in the bag (2 red and 5 white).\n   - Probability = \\( \\frac{5}{7} \\)\n\n3. **Combined probability:**\n   - The combined probability of both events happening is the product of the two probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the probabilities\nprob_red_first = 3 / 8\nprob_white_second_given_red_first = 5 / 7\n\n# Combined probability\ncombined_probability = prob_red_first * prob_white_second_given_red_first\ncombined_probability\nassistant > The probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white is approximately \\(0.267857\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<0.267857>>>."
