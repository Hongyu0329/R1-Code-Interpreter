    "\nassistant > To find the probability that the product \\(abc = 1\\) when three standard dice are tossed, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and the conditions under which their product equals 1.\n\nEach die can show a number from 1 to 6. For the product \\(abc\\) to be 1, each of the numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) must be 1, because 1 is the only number on a die that can multiply with others to give 1.\n\nLet's calculate the probability:\n\n1. The total number of possible outcomes when three dice are tossed is \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\).\n\n2. The favorable outcome for \\(abc = 1\\) is when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\). There is only 1 such outcome.\n\nThe probability is then given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{1}{216}\n\\]\n\nLet's express this probability in the required format.\nassistant > The probability that the product \\(abc = 1\\) when three standard dice are tossed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{216}\n\\]\n\nExpressing this in the required format:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{1}{216} \\approx 0.00462963\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0.00462963>>>}\n\\]"
