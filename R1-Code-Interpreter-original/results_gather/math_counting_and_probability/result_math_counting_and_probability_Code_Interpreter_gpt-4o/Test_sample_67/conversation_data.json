    "\nassistant > To find the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled, we can use the concept of expected value in probability.\n\nFor a single die, the probability of rolling a 1 is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). Therefore, the expected number of 1's for one die is:\n\n\\[\nE_1 = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 0 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nSince the two dice are independent, the expected number of 1's for two dice is the sum of the expected number of 1's for each die:\n\n\\[\nE_2 = E_1 + E_1 = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
