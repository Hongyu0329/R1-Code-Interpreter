    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that two randomly selected different natural numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) have a greatest common factor (GCF) of 1. This means the two numbers are coprime.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to select two different numbers from the set. This is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of pairs that are coprime. We will list all possible pairs and check their GCF:\n\n1. (1, 2) - GCF is 1\n2. (1, 3) - GCF is 1\n3. (1, 4) - GCF is 1\n4. (1, 5) - GCF is 1\n5. (1, 6) - GCF is 1\n6. (2, 3) - GCF is 1\n7. (2, 4) - GCF is 2\n8. (2, 5) - GCF is 1\n9. (2, 6) - GCF is 2\n10. (3, 4) - GCF is 1\n11. (3, 5) - GCF is 1\n12. (3, 6) - GCF is 3\n13. (4, 5) - GCF is 1\n14. (4, 6) - GCF is 2\n15. (5, 6) - GCF is 1\n\nNow, we count the pairs with GCF equal to 1. Let's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import gcd\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Set of numbers\nnumbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n# Generate all combinations of two different numbers\npairs = combinations(numbers, 2)\n\n# Count pairs with GCF equal to 1\ncoprime_count = sum(1 for a, b in pairs if gcd(a, b) == 1)\ncoprime_count\nassistant > There are 11 pairs of numbers that are coprime (i.e., their greatest common factor is 1).\n\nThe probability that two randomly selected different natural numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) are coprime is given by the ratio of coprime pairs to the total number of pairs:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of coprime pairs}}{\\text{Total number of pairs}} = \\frac{11}{15}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\frac{11}{15}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<11/15>>>."
