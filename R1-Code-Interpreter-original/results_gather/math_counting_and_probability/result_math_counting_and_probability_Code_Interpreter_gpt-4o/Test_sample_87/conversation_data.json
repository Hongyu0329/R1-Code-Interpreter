    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions under which the product of the values of four dice is even and the sum of their values is odd.\n\n### Step 1: Probability that the product is even\nThe product of the values of the dice is even if at least one of the dice shows an even number. A six-sided die has three even numbers (2, 4, 6) and three odd numbers (1, 3, 5). The probability that a single die shows an odd number is \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThe probability that all four dice show odd numbers (and thus the product is odd) is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product is even is:\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Probability that the sum is odd given the product is even\nFor the sum of the dice to be odd, an odd number of dice must show odd numbers. Since the product is even, at least one die must show an even number.\n\nLet's consider the cases where the sum is odd:\n\n1. **One die shows an even number and three dice show odd numbers:**\n   - Choose 1 die to show an even number: \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\) ways.\n   - Probability for this configuration: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\\).\n\n2. **Three dice show even numbers and one die shows an odd number:**\n   - Choose 1 die to show an odd number: \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\) ways.\n   - Probability for this configuration: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\\).\n\nThe total probability that the sum is odd given the product is even is the sum of these probabilities:\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} + 4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Final Probability\nThe probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/2>>>"
