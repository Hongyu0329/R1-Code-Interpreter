    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that exactly two out of the four 20-sided dice show an even number.\n\n1. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a single die:**\n   - A 20-sided die has 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 20) and 10 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 19).\n   - Probability of rolling an even number on one die, \\( P(E) = \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the probability of rolling an odd number on a single die:**\n   - Probability of rolling an odd number on one die, \\( P(O) = \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Use the binomial probability formula:**\n   - We want exactly 2 out of 4 dice to show an even number.\n   - The binomial probability formula is:\n     \\[\n     P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot (p)^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - \\( n = 4 \\) (number of trials),\n     - \\( k = 2 \\) (number of successful trials),\n     - \\( p = \\frac{1}{2} \\) (probability of success on a single trial).\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Parameters\nn = 4  # number of dice\nk = 2  # number of dice showing even numbers\np = 0.5  # probability of rolling an even number on one die\n\n# Binomial probability\nprobability = comb(n, k) * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(n-k))\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that exactly two of the four 20-sided dice show an even number is \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) or 0.375.\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<0.375>>>."
