    "\nassistant > The outcome of each coin flip is independent of the previous flips. Since the coin is fair, the probability of flipping a tail on any single flip is always \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), regardless of the outcomes of previous flips.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Molly will flip a tail on her next flip is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
