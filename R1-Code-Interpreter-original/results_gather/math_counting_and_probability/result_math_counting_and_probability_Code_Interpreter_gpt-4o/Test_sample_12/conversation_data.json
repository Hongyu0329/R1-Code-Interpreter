    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of 3-letter words that can be formed using the letters A, B, C, and D with repetition allowed, and then subtract the number of words that do not contain the letter A at all.\n\n1. **Total number of 3-letter words with repetition allowed:**\n\n   Since we have 4 letters (A, B, C, D) and each position in the 3-letter word can be filled by any of these 4 letters, the total number of 3-letter words is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 4^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of 3-letter words without the letter A:**\n\n   If the letter A is not used, we only have 3 letters (B, C, D) to choose from for each position. Thus, the number of 3-letter words without the letter A is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of 3-letter words with at least one A:**\n\n   To find the number of words with at least one A, we subtract the number of words without any A from the total number of words:\n   \\[\n   4^3 - 3^3\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the total number of 3-letter words with repetition allowed\ntotal_words = 4**3\n\n# Calculate the number of 3-letter words without the letter A\nwords_without_A = 3**3\n\n# Calculate the number of 3-letter words with at least one A\nwords_with_at_least_one_A = total_words - words_without_A\nwords_with_at_least_one_A\nassistant > The number of 3-letter words that can be made from the letters A, B, C, and D, with repetition allowed and using the letter A at least once, is \\(\\boxed{37}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<37>>>."
