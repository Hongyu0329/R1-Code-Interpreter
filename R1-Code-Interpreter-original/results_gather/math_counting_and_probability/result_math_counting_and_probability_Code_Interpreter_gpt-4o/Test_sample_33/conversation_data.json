    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that no two of the three randomly chosen points on a circle form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Circle and Angles**: When three points are chosen on a circle, they form a triangle. The center of the circle is equidistant from all three points, making it the circumcenter of the triangle.\n\n2. **Obtuse Triangle Condition**: A triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than 90 degrees. For a triangle formed by three points on a circle, an angle at the center is obtuse if it is greater than 180 degrees.\n\n3. **Complementary Condition**: The condition that no two points form an obtuse triangle with the center is equivalent to saying that all central angles formed by the points are less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n\n### Probability Calculation:\n\n- **Uniform Distribution**: The points are chosen uniformly, meaning each point can be anywhere on the circle.\n\n- **Non-Obtuse Condition**: For no two points to form an obtuse triangle with the center, the arc between any two points must be less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n\n- **Complementary Probability**: The probability that at least one angle is obtuse is easier to calculate, and we can subtract this from 1 to find the desired probability.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements**: Consider the circle as a 360-degree circle. The first point can be placed anywhere, the second point can be placed anywhere, and the third point can be placed anywhere.\n\n2. **Non-Obtuse Condition**: For no angle to be obtuse, the largest arc between any two points must be less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n\n3. **Probability**: The probability that the largest arc is less than or equal to 180 degrees is equivalent to the probability that the points are all within a semicircle.\n\nThe probability that all three points lie within a semicircle is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). Therefore, the probability that no two points form an obtuse triangle with the center is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{no obtuse triangle}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThus, the probability that no two of these points form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nLet's express this probability in the required format:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.75>>>"
