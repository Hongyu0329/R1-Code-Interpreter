    "\nassistant > To find the probability that the sum of the face-up integers on three standard 6-faced dice is 16, we need to consider the possible outcomes and the total number of outcomes.\n\n1. **Total number of outcomes**: Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling three dice is \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\).\n\n2. **Favorable outcomes**: We need to find the combinations of numbers on the three dice that sum to 16. The possible combinations are:\n   - (6, 6, 4)\n   - (6, 4, 6)\n   - (4, 6, 6)\n   - (6, 5, 5)\n   - (5, 6, 5)\n   - (5, 5, 6)\n\nLet's calculate the number of favorable outcomes and then the probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# All possible outcomes for three dice\noutcomes = product(range(1, 7), repeat=3)\n\n# Count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is 16\nfavorable_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) == 16)\n\n# Total number of outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 6 ** 3\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that the sum of the face-up integers on three standard 6-faced dice is 16 is approximately \\(0.0278\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<0.0278>>>."
