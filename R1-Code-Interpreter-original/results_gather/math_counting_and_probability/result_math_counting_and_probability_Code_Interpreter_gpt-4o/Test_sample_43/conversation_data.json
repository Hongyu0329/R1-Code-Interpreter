    "\nassistant > The probability that it will not rain tomorrow is the complement of the probability that it will rain. The complement rule states that the probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.\n\nGiven that the probability of rain tomorrow is \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\), the probability that it will not rain is:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that it will not rain tomorrow is \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\).\n\nYour answer: <<<\\(\\frac{7}{10}\\)>>>"
