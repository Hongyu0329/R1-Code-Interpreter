    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to consider two main steps:\n\n1. **Choose 6 people out of 7**: This can be done in \\(\\binom{7}{6}\\) ways, which is equal to 7.\n\n2. **Seat the 6 people around a circular table**: When seating people around a circular table, we need to account for rotations being considered the same. The number of distinct ways to arrange \\(n\\) people in a circle is \\((n-1)!\\). For 6 people, this is \\(5!\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of ways:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{7}{6} \\times (6-1)!\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import factorial\n\n# Number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7\nways_to_choose = 7\n\n# Number of ways to arrange 6 people in a circle\nways_to_arrange = factorial(6 - 1)\n\n# Total number of ways\ntotal_ways = ways_to_choose * ways_to_arrange\ntotal_ways\nassistant > The total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table is \\(\\boxed{840}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<840>>>."
