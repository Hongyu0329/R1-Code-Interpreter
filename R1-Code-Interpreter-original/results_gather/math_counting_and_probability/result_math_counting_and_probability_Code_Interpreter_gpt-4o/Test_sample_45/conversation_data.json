    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{ 2, 4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 50 \\}\\) is a multiple of 100.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set. The set has 7 elements, so the number of ways to choose 2 elements is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of pairs whose product is a multiple of 100. A product is a multiple of 100 if it has at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5 (since \\(100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2\\)).\n\nLet's examine the prime factorization of each number in the set:\n\n- \\(2 = 2^1\\)\n- \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n- \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3^1\\)\n- \\(15 = 3^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n\nTo have a product that is a multiple of 100, we need at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5. Let's identify the pairs that satisfy this condition:\n\n1. \\( (10, 20) \\): \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\), \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^3 \\times 5^2\\)\n2. \\( (10, 50) \\): \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\), \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^2 \\times 5^3\\)\n3. \\( (20, 50) \\): \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\), \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(2^3 \\times 5^3\\)\n\nThese are the only pairs that satisfy the condition. There are 3 such pairs.\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{3}{21} = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product is a multiple of 100 is \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<1/7>>>"
