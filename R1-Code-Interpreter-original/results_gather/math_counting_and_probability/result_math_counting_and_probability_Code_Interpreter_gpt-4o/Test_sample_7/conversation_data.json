    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle from the 2 by 2003 rectangle does not include a shaded square.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Shaded Squares\nThe middle unit square of each row is shaded. Since the rectangle is 2 by 2003, the middle square in each row is the 1002nd square. Therefore, the shaded squares are at positions (1, 1002) and (2, 1002).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Number of Rectangles\nA rectangle is defined by choosing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. There are 3 horizontal lines (top, middle, bottom) and 2004 vertical lines (left of the first column to right of the last column).\n\n- Number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines from 3: \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\)\n- Number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from 2004: \\(\\binom{2004}{2} = \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2}\\)\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles is:\n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Number of Rectangles Not Including Shaded Squares\nTo avoid including the shaded squares, we can consider the rectangles that are entirely to the left or right of the 1002nd column.\n\n- Rectangles entirely to the left: Choose 2 vertical lines from the first 1001 lines.\n- Rectangles entirely to the right: Choose 2 vertical lines from the last 1002 lines.\n\n- Number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from 1001: \\(\\binom{1001}{2} = \\frac{1001 \\times 1000}{2}\\)\n- Number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from 1002: \\(\\binom{1002}{2} = \\frac{1002 \\times 1001}{2}\\)\n\nThus, the number of rectangles not including shaded squares is:\n\\[\n3 \\times \\left(\\frac{1001 \\times 1000}{2} + \\frac{1002 \\times 1001}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does not include a shaded square is the ratio of the number of rectangles not including shaded squares to the total number of rectangles.\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of rectangles\ntotal_rectangles = 3 * comb(2004, 2)\n\n# Rectangles not including shaded squares\nrectangles_left = comb(1001, 2)\nrectangles_right = comb(1002, 2)\nrectangles_not_including_shaded = 3 * (rectangles_left + rectangles_right)\n\n# Probability\nprobability = rectangles_not_including_shaded / total_rectangles\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does not include a shaded square is \\(\\frac{499001}{1002003}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.49925162156964153>>>"
