    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that two randomly chosen cards from a standard 52-card deck are both numbered cards (2 through 10) and that their sum is 12.\n\nFirst, let's identify the possible pairs of numbered cards that sum to 12:\n\n- 2 and 10\n- 3 and 9\n- 4 and 8\n- 5 and 7\n- 6 and 6\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose each pair from the deck:\n\n1. **2 and 10**: There are 4 twos and 4 tens in the deck, so there are \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) ways to choose a 2 and a 10.\n2. **3 and 9**: There are 4 threes and 4 nines, so there are \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) ways to choose a 3 and a 9.\n3. **4 and 8**: There are 4 fours and 4 eights, so there are \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) ways to choose a 4 and an 8.\n4. **5 and 7**: There are 4 fives and 4 sevens, so there are \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) ways to choose a 5 and a 7.\n5. **6 and 6**: There are 4 sixes, so there are \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways to choose two sixes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of favorable outcomes:\n\n\\[\n16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 6 = 70\n\\]\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any two cards from a 52-card deck is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{52}{2}\\).\n\nFinally, the probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. Let's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of ways to choose any two cards from a 52-card deck\ntotal_outcomes = comb(52, 2)\n\n# Total number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 6\n\n# Probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that both cards are numbers (2 through 10) totaling to 12 is approximately \\(0.0528\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<0.0528>>>."
