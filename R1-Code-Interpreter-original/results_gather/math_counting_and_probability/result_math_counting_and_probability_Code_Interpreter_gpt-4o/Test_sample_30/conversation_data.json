    "\nassistant > To find the probability that a randomly picked point \\((x, y)\\) from inside the rectangle satisfies \\(x < y\\), we need to determine the area of the region where \\(x < y\\) and divide it by the total area of the rectangle.\n\n1. **Total Area of the Rectangle:**\n   The rectangle has vertices \\((0,0)\\), \\((3,0)\\), \\((3,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\). The width of the rectangle is 3 and the height is 2, so the total area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Area} = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area where \\(x < y\\):**\n   The line \\(x = y\\) is a diagonal line that starts from \\((0,0)\\) and ends at \\((2,2)\\) within the rectangle. The region where \\(x < y\\) is above this line and within the rectangle.\n\n   The line \\(x = y\\) intersects the top boundary of the rectangle at \\((2,2)\\) and the right boundary at \\((3,3)\\), but since the rectangle only extends to \\((3,2)\\), the relevant intersection is at \\((2,2)\\).\n\n   The region where \\(x < y\\) is a right triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\).\n\n   The base and height of this triangle are both 2, so the area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area where } x < y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Probability:**\n   The probability that a randomly picked point \\((x, y)\\) satisfies \\(x < y\\) is the ratio of the area where \\(x < y\\) to the total area of the rectangle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area where } x < y}{\\text{Total Area}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that \\(x < y\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{<<<0.333>>>}}\n\\]"
