    "\nassistant > To determine the maximum number of planes that can be formed by 12 points in space, we need to consider the number of ways to choose 3 points out of 12, since a plane is uniquely determined by three non-collinear points.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 points from 12 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of points, and \\( r \\) is the number of points to choose. In this case, \\( n = 12 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\).\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of points\nn = 12\n# Number of points to choose to form a plane\nr = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\nnumber_of_planes = comb(n, r)\nnumber_of_planes\nassistant > The maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space is \\(\\binom{12}{3} = 220\\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<220>>>."
