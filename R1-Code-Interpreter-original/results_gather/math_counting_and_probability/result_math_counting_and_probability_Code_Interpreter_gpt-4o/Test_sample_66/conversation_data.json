    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outfits and then subtract the number of outfits where all three items are the same color.\n\n1. **Total number of outfits**: Since you have 6 choices for each item (shirt, pants, and hat), the total number of possible outfits is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n   \\]\n\n2. **Outfits with all items the same color**: There are 6 colors, and for each color, there is exactly one outfit where all items are the same color. Therefore, there are 6 such outfits.\n\n3. **Valid outfits**: Subtract the number of outfits where all items are the same color from the total number of outfits:\n   \\[\n   216 - 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of valid outfit choices is 210.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<210>>>."
