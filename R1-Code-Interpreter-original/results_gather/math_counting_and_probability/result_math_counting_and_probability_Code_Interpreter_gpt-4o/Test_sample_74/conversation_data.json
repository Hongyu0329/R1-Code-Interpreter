    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the number on the coin and the number on the die equals 14.\n\n1. **Coin Flip Outcomes**: The coin has two sides labeled 10 and 20. Each side has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Die Roll Outcomes**: A standard die has six faces numbered from 1 to 6. Each face has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n3. **Possible Sums**:\n   - If the coin shows 10, the possible sums with the die are \\( 10 + 1, 10 + 2, 10 + 3, 10 + 4, 10 + 5, 10 + 6 \\).\n   - If the coin shows 20, the possible sums with the die are \\( 20 + 1, 20 + 2, 20 + 3, 20 + 4, 20 + 5, 20 + 6 \\).\n\n4. **Desired Outcome**: We want the sum to be 14.\n\nLet's calculate the probability:\n\n- **Coin shows 10**: The die must show 4 to make the sum 14. The probability of this is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n- **Coin shows 20**: The die cannot show any number to make the sum 14, as the minimum sum is 21.\n\nThe probability of the sum being 14 is the probability of the coin showing 10 and the die showing 4.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum} = 14) = P(\\text{coin} = 10) \\times P(\\text{die} = 4) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the sum equals Erika's age is \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/12>>>"
