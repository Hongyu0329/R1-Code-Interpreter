    "\nassistant > To find how many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers.\n2. Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5.\n3. Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.\n4. Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35).\n5. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of either 5 or 7.\n6. Subtract the result from step 5 from the total number of three-digit numbers to get the count of numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Step 1: Total number of three-digit numbers\ntotal_three_digit_numbers = 999 - 100 + 1\n\n# Step 2: Number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5\nmultiples_of_5 = (995 - 100) // 5 + 1\n\n# Step 3: Number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7\nmultiples_of_7 = (994 - 105) // 7 + 1\n\n# Step 4: Number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7 (multiples of 35)\nmultiples_of_35 = (980 - 105) // 35 + 1\n\n# Step 5: Use inclusion-exclusion principle\nmultiples_of_5_or_7 = multiples_of_5 + multiples_of_7 - multiples_of_35\n\n# Step 6: Calculate numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7\nmultiples_of_neither_5_nor_7 = total_three_digit_numbers - multiples_of_5_or_7\n\nmultiples_of_neither_5_nor_7\nassistant > The number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is <<<618>>>."
