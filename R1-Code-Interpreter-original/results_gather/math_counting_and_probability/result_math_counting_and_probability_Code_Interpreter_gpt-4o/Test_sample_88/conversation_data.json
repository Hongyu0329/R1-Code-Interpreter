    "\nassistant > To find the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle, we need to identify the smallest number that is greater than or equal to 100. Pascal's triangle is constructed using binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) that is a three-digit number.
