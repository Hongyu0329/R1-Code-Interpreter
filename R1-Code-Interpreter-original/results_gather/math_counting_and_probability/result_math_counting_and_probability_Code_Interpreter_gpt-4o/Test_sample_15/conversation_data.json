    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of 4-letter words that can be formed from the given letters and then subtract the number of 4-letter words that contain no vowels.\n\n1. **Total number of 4-letter words:**\n   - We have 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E) and each position in the 4-letter word can be filled by any of these 5 letters.\n   - Therefore, the total number of 4-letter words is \\(5^4\\).\n\n2. **Number of 4-letter words with no vowels:**\n   - The consonants are B, C, and D.\n   - Each position in the 4-letter word can be filled by any of these 3 consonants.\n   - Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with no vowels is \\(3^4\\).\n\n3. **Number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel:**\n   - This is the total number of 4-letter words minus the number of 4-letter words with no vowels.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Total number of 4-letter words\ntotal_words = 5**4\n\n# Number of 4-letter words with no vowels\nno_vowel_words = 3**4\n\n# Number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel\nat_least_one_vowel = total_words - no_vowel_words\nat_least_one_vowel\nassistant > The number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E is <<<544>>>."
