    "\nassistant > To determine the probability that a randomly selected point on the number line from 0 to 5 is closer to 4 than to 0, we need to find the region on the number line where this condition holds true.\n\nA point \\( x \\) on the number line is closer to 4 than to 0 if the distance from \\( x \\) to 4 is less than the distance from \\( x \\) to 0. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n|x - 4| < |x - 0|\n\\]\n\nThis inequality can be solved to find the range of \\( x \\) values that satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's solve this inequality.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Abs\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the inequality\ninequality = Abs(x - 4) < Abs(x - 0)\n\n# Solve the inequality\nsolution = solve(inequality, x)\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the inequality \\( |x - 4| < |x - 0| \\) is \\( 2 < x < \\infty \\). However, since the number line is only from 0 to 5, we restrict this to \\( 2 < x < 5 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected point from 0 to 5 falls within this range. The length of the interval \\( 2 < x < 5 \\) is \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\).\n\nThe total length of the number line from 0 to 5 is \\( 5 - 0 = 5 \\).\n\nThe probability is the ratio of the length of the interval where the condition holds to the total length of the number line:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability and express it as a decimal to the nearest tenth.# Calculate the probability\nprobability = 3 / 5\n\n# Round to the nearest tenth\nprobability_rounded = round(probability, 1)\nprobability_rounded\nassistant > The probability that a randomly selected point on the number line from 0 to 5 is closer to 4 than to 0 is \\(\\boxed{0.6}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<0.6>>>."
