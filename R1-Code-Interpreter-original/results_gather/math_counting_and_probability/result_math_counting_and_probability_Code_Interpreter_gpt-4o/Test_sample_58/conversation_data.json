    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that, when rolling six 6-sided dice, exactly three of them show even numbers and three show odd numbers.\n\nEach die has three even numbers (2, 4, 6) and three odd numbers (1, 3, 5). Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on a single die is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and the probability of rolling an odd number is also \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 dice to show even numbers out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe probability of a specific combination of 3 even and 3 odd numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nThus, the total probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient\nbinom_coeff = comb(6, 3)\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = binom_coeff * (0.5 ** 6)\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal is <<<0.3125>>>."
