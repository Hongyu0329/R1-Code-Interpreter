    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. \n\nSince the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to count the number of distinct partitions of the balls into two groups, where the order of the groups does not matter. \n\nLet's consider the possible distributions:\n\n1. All 4 balls in one box and 0 in the other: There is only 1 way to do this.\n2. 3 balls in one box and 1 in the other: We choose 1 ball to be alone, and the rest go together. There are \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\) ways to do this.\n3. 2 balls in each box: We choose 2 balls to be in one box, and the other 2 will automatically be in the other box. There are \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways to do this, but since the boxes are indistinguishable, we divide by 2, giving us 3 ways.\n\nNow, let's sum these possibilities:\n\n- 1 way for all 4 in one box\n- 4 ways for 3 in one box and 1 in the other\n- 3 ways for 2 in each box\n\nTotal number of ways = \\(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\\).\n\nThus, the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes is 8.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<8>>>."
