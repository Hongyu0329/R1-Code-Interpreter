    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from rolling three standard dice is 180. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice. Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the product \\(abc = 180\\).\n\nThe prime factorization of 180 is:\n\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\]\n\nWe need to distribute these prime factors among the three numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that each number is between 1 and 6 (inclusive).\n\nLet's list the possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that satisfy this condition:\n\n1. \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 6\\), \\(c = 6\\)\n2. \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 5\\), \\(c = 6\\)\n3. \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 6\\), \\(c = 5\\)\n\nThese are the only combinations where the product is 180, as any other combination would result in a number greater than 6 for at least one of the dice.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{216} \\]\n\nLet's compute this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the probability\nfavorable_outcomes = 3\ntotal_outcomes = 6 * 6 * 6\n\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that the product \\(abc = 180\\) when three standard dice are tossed is approximately \\(0.0139\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0139>>>"
