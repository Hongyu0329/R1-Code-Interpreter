    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events occurring:\n\n1. Rolling a number less than 3 on the first die.\n2. Rolling a number greater than 3 on the second die.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each event:\n\n1. **Probability of rolling a number less than 3 on the first die:**\n   - The numbers less than 3 on a six-sided die are 1 and 2.\n   - There are 2 favorable outcomes (1 and 2) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n   - Probability = \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second die:**\n   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.\n   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n   - Probability = \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSince these two events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to find the combined probability:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined Probability} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that Nathan will roll a number less than 3 on the first die and a number greater than 3 on the second die is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
