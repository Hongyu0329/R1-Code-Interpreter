    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other in a row of 7 chairs.\n\n1. **Total number of ways Mary and James can sit:**\n   - There are 7 chairs, and Mary can choose any of the 7 chairs.\n   - After Mary chooses a chair, James can choose any of the remaining 6 chairs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of ways they can sit is \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\).\n\n2. **Number of ways Mary and James sit next to each other:**\n   - Consider Mary and James as a single \"block\" when they sit next to each other.\n   - This \"block\" can be placed in 6 different positions: (1-2), (2-3), (3-4), (4-5), (5-6), (6-7).\n   - Within this \"block\", Mary and James can switch places, so there are 2 arrangements for each block position.\n   - Therefore, the number of ways they can sit next to each other is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Number of ways Mary and James do not sit next to each other:**\n   - Subtract the number of ways they sit next to each other from the total number of ways.\n   - \\(42 - 12 = 30\\).\n\n4. **Probability that they do not sit next to each other:**\n   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n   - \\(\\frac{30}{42} = \\frac{5}{7}\\).\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Total number of ways Mary and James can sit\ntotal_ways = 7 * 6\n\n# Number of ways Mary and James sit next to each other\nnext_to_each_other_ways = 6 * 2\n\n# Number of ways Mary and James do not sit next to each other\nnot_next_to_each_other_ways = total_ways - next_to_each_other_ways\n\n# Probability that they do not sit next to each other\nprobability_not_next_to_each_other = not_next_to_each_other_ways / total_ways\nprobability_not_next_to_each_other\nassistant > The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\), which is approximately 0.7143.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<0.7143>>>."
