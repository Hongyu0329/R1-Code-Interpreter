    "\nassistant > To find the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in the expansion of \\((x-1)^9\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(a = x\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(n = 9\\). We are interested in the term where the power of \\(x\\) is 8, which means \\(n-k = 8\\). Therefore, \\(k = 9 - 8 = 1\\).\n\nThe term in the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{1} x^{9-1} (-1)^1\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this term.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Calculate the coefficient\nn = 9\nk = 1\ncoefficient = comb(n, k) * (-1)**k\ncoefficient\nassistant > The coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in the expansion of \\((x-1)^9\\) is \\(-9\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<-9>>>."
