    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. This is a classic problem in combinatorics, often solved using the \"stars and bars\" method, but with the added complexity of indistinguishable boxes.\n\nFor indistinguishable balls and indistinguishable boxes, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of partitions of the integer 4 into at most 2 parts. The partitions of 4 are:\n\n1. \\(4\\)\n2. \\(3 + 1\\)\n3. \\(2 + 2\\)\n4. \\(2 + 1 + 1\\)\n5. \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1\\)\n\nHowever, since we have at most 2 parts (because there are 2 boxes), we only consider partitions with 1 or 2 parts:\n\n- \\(4\\) (all balls in one box)\n- \\(3 + 1\\) (three balls in one box, one in the other)\n- \\(2 + 2\\) (two balls in each box)\n\nNow, let's count these partitions:\n\n1. \\(4\\): All balls in one box.\n2. \\(3 + 1\\): Three balls in one box, one in the other.\n3. \\(2 + 2\\): Two balls in each box.\n\nSince the boxes are indistinguishable, the partitions \\(3 + 1\\) and \\(1 + 3\\) are considered the same, and similarly for other combinations.\n\nThus, the number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of valid partitions, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways} = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
