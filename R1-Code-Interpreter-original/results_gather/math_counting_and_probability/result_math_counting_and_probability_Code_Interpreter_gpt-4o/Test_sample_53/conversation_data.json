    "\nassistant > To find the probability that the number on the selected ball is a multiple of 5 or 7 or both, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1. **Count the multiples of 5:**\n   - The multiples of 5 from 1 to 50 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50.\n   - There are 10 multiples of 5.\n\n2. **Count the multiples of 7:**\n   - The multiples of 7 from 1 to 50 are: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49.\n   - There are 7 multiples of 7.\n\n3. **Count the multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35):**\n   - The multiples of 35 from 1 to 50 are: 35.\n   - There is 1 multiple of 35.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of balls that are multiples of 5 or 7 or both is:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(|A|\\) is the number of multiples of 5.\n- \\(|B|\\) is the number of multiples of 7.\n- \\(|A \\cap B|\\) is the number of multiples of both 5 and 7.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of multiples of 5\nmultiples_of_5 = 10\n\n# Number of multiples of 7\nmultiples_of_7 = 7\n\n# Number of multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35)\nmultiples_of_35 = 1\n\n# Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nmultiples_of_5_or_7 = multiples_of_5 + multiples_of_7 - multiples_of_35\n\n# Total number of balls\ntotal_balls = 50\n\n# Probability\nprobability = multiples_of_5_or_7 / total_balls\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that the number on the selected ball is a multiple of 5 or 7 or both is \\(\\frac{16}{50}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{8}{25}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability is <<<0.32>>>."
