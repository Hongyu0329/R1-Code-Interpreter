    "\nassistant > To find the number of unit squares in the \\( n^{th} \\) ring, we need to observe the pattern in the number of squares in each ring.\n\n1. The first ring contains 8 unit squares.\n2. The second ring contains 16 unit squares.\n\nWe can see that each ring forms a square around the previous rings. The number of unit squares in each ring increases by 8 as we move to the next ring. This is because each new ring adds a layer of squares around the existing structure, and each side of the square increases by 2 units (one on each end), resulting in an additional 8 squares per ring.\n\nThus, the number of unit squares in the \\( n^{th} \\) ring is given by:\n\\[ 8n \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of unit squares in the \\( 100^{th} \\) ring:\n\\[ 8 \\times 100 = 800 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of unit squares in the \\( 100^{th} \\) ring is 800.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<800>>>"
