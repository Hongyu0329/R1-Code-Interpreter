    "\nassistant > To find the probability that the ball selected is green, we can use the law of total probability. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Probability of selecting each container:**\n   - There are 3 containers, so the probability of selecting any one container is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of selecting a green ball from each container:**\n   - **Container I:** It has 8 red balls and 4 green balls, so the probability of selecting a green ball is \\( \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n   - **Container II:** It has 2 red balls and 4 green balls, so the probability of selecting a green ball is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n   - **Container III:** It has 2 red balls and 4 green balls, so the probability of selecting a green ball is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Total probability of selecting a green ball:**\n   - Using the law of total probability, the total probability of selecting a green ball is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{green}) = P(\\text{green} \\mid \\text{Container I}) \\cdot P(\\text{Container I}) + P(\\text{green} \\mid \\text{Container II}) \\cdot P(\\text{Container II}) + P(\\text{green} \\mid \\text{Container III}) \\cdot P(\\text{Container III})\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Probabilities of selecting a green ball from each container\nP_green_I = 4 / 12\nP_green_II = 4 / 6\nP_green_III = 4 / 6\n\n# Probability of selecting each container\nP_container = 1 / 3\n\n# Total probability of selecting a green ball\nP_green = (P_green_I * P_container) + (P_green_II * P_container) + (P_green_III * P_container)\nP_green\nassistant > The probability that the ball selected is green is \\( \\frac{5}{9} \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<5/9>>>."
