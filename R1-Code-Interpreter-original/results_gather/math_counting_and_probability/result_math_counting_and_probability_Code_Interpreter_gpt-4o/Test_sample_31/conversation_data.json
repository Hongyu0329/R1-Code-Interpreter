    "\nassistant > To determine the number of ways Johnny can choose three different marbles from his bag of 7 different colored marbles, we can use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\). Let's calculate the number of combinations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Total number of marbles\nn = 7\n# Number of marbles to choose\nr = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\ncombinations = math.comb(n, r)\ncombinations\nassistant > The number of ways Johnny can choose three different marbles from his bag is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<35>>>."
