    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two randomly picked shoes are of the same color and consist of one left shoe and one right shoe.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of ways to pick two shoes from the 22 shoes (11 pairs):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways to pick 2 shoes} = \\binom{22}{2}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes for each color:\n\n1. **Black Shoes:**\n   - There are 6 pairs of black shoes, so there are 6 left black shoes and 6 right black shoes.\n   - The number of ways to pick one left and one right black shoe is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\n2. **Brown Shoes:**\n   - There are 3 pairs of brown shoes, so there are 3 left brown shoes and 3 right brown shoes.\n   - The number of ways to pick one left and one right brown shoe is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n3. **Gray Shoes:**\n   - There are 2 pairs of gray shoes, so there are 2 left gray shoes and 2 right gray shoes.\n   - The number of ways to pick one left and one right gray shoe is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\nNow, we sum up the favorable outcomes for all colors and divide by the total number of ways to pick two shoes to find the probability:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{36 + 9 + 4}{\\binom{22}{2}}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of ways to pick 2 shoes from 22\ntotal_ways = comb(22, 2)\n\n# Favorable outcomes for each color\nfavorable_black = 6 * 6\nfavorable_brown = 3 * 3\nfavorable_gray = 2 * 2\n\n# Total favorable outcomes\ntotal_favorable = favorable_black + favorable_brown + favorable_gray\n\n# Probability\nprobability = total_favorable / total_ways\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that two randomly picked shoes are of the same color and consist of one left shoe and one right shoe is \\(\\frac{7}{33}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<7/33>>>."
