    "\nassistant > To find the probability that both marbles drawn are red, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\n1. **Total number of marbles**: \n   - Red marbles = 2\n   - Green marbles = 3\n   - White marbles = 10\n   - Total marbles = 2 + 3 + 10 = 15\n\n2. **Number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 15**: \n   This is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), which represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) items from \\(n\\) items without regard to order. \n   \\[\n   \\binom{15}{2} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of ways to choose 2 red marbles from 2**: \n   \\[\n   \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Probability that both marbles are red**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 red marbles}}{\\text{Total number of ways to choose 2 marbles}} = \\frac{\\binom{2}{2}}{\\binom{15}{2}}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 15\ntotal_ways = comb(15, 2)\n\n# Number of ways to choose 2 red marbles from 2\nred_ways = comb(2, 2)\n\n# Probability that both marbles are red\nprobability = red_ways / total_ways\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that both marbles drawn are red is \\(\\frac{1}{105}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<1/105>>>."
