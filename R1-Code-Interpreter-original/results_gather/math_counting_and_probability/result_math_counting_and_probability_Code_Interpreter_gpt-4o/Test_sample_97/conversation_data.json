    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a cube, with each face painted either red or blue independently with a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), can be oriented such that all four vertical faces are the same color.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Total Number of Colorings:**\n   Each face of the cube can be either red or blue, and there are 6 faces. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings of the cube is:\n   \\[\n   2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes:**\n   We need to count the number of ways to paint the cube such that it can be oriented with all four vertical faces the same color. \n\n   - **Case 1: All faces are the same color.**\n     - All 6 faces are red: 1 way\n     - All 6 faces are blue: 1 way\n     - Total for this case: 2 ways\n\n   - **Case 2: Four vertical faces are the same color, and the top and bottom faces are the other color.**\n     - Choose a color for the vertical faces (red or blue): 2 choices\n     - Choose the opposite color for the top and bottom faces: 1 choice\n     - Total for this case: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) ways\n\n   Since there are 3 pairs of opposite faces (top-bottom, front-back, left-right), and each pair can be the top-bottom pair, we multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ ways}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Favorable Outcomes:**\n   Adding the two cases together, we have:\n   \\[\n   2 + 6 = 8 \\text{ favorable outcomes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:**\n   The probability that the cube can be oriented such that all four vertical faces are the same color is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\n\\]\n\nIn the required format:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0.125>>>}\n\\]"
