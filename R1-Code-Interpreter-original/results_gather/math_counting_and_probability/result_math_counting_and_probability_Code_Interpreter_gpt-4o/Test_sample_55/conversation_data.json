    "\nassistant > When the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are, we are dealing with a problem of distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins. \n\nIn this case, we have 5 indistinguishable balls and 2 distinguishable boxes. The problem can be solved using the \"stars and bars\" method, which is a common combinatorial technique.\n\nThe formula for distributing \\( n \\) indistinguishable objects into \\( k \\) distinguishable bins is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, \\( n = 5 \\) (balls) and \\( k = 2 \\) (boxes).
