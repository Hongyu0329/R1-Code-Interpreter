    "\nassistant > To determine the number of different sandwiches Alex can make, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Choosing the Meat**: Alex has 10 different kinds of lunch meat. He can choose 1 kind of meat in 10 different ways.\n\n2. **Choosing the Cheese**: Alex has 9 different kinds of cheese, and he wants to choose 2 kinds of cheese. Since the order in which he chooses the cheese does not matter, we use combinations to determine the number of ways to choose 2 cheeses from 9. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nLet's calculate the number of different sandwiches Alex can make.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of ways to choose 1 kind of meat from 10\nmeat_choices = 10\n\n# Number of ways to choose 2 kinds of cheese from 9\ncheese_choices = comb(9, 2)\n\n# Total number of different sandwiches\ntotal_sandwiches = meat_choices * cheese_choices\ntotal_sandwiches\nassistant > The total number of different sandwiches Alex can make is <<<360>>>."
