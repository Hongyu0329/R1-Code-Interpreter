    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events happening simultaneously:\n\n1. The leftmost lamp is blue and off.\n2. The rightmost lamp is red and on.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Arranging the lamps:**\n   - Ryan has 3 red and 3 blue lamps, making a total of 6 lamps.\n   - The number of ways to arrange these lamps in a row is given by the combination formula for arranging 3 red and 3 blue lamps: \\(\\frac{6!}{3!3!}\\).\n\n2. **Turning on 3 lamps:**\n   - Out of the 6 lamps, 3 are turned on. The number of ways to choose 3 lamps to turn on from 6 is given by \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\n3. **Specific conditions:**\n   - The leftmost lamp is blue and off.\n   - The rightmost lamp is red and on.\n\nLet's calculate the probability step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Total number of ways to arrange 3 red and 3 blue lamps\ntotal_arrangements = math.comb(6, 3)\n\n# Total number of ways to turn on 3 lamps out of 6\ntotal_turn_on_ways = math.comb(6, 3)\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\n# 1. Leftmost lamp is blue and off\n# 2. Rightmost lamp is red and on\n\n# Choose 1 blue lamp for the leftmost position (off)\n# Choose 1 red lamp for the rightmost position (on)\n# Arrange the remaining 4 lamps (2 red, 2 blue) in the middle\n# Choose 2 lamps to turn on from the 4 middle lamps\n\n# Number of ways to choose 1 blue lamp for the leftmost position\nways_leftmost_blue_off = 3\n\n# Number of ways to choose 1 red lamp for the rightmost position\nways_rightmost_red_on = 3\n\n# Number of ways to arrange the remaining 4 lamps (2 red, 2 blue)\nways_arrange_middle = math.comb(4, 2)\n\n# Number of ways to choose 2 lamps to turn on from the 4 middle lamps\nways_turn_on_middle = math.comb(4, 2)\n\n# Total number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = (ways_leftmost_blue_off * ways_rightmost_red_on *\n                      ways_arrange_middle * ways_turn_on_middle)\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / (total_arrangements * total_turn_on_ways)\nprobability\nassistant > The probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on is \\(\\frac{81}{100}\\) or 0.81.\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<0.81>>>."
