    "\nassistant > To find how many three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits, we can use the principle of complementary counting.\n\n1. **Total number of three-digit numbers**: The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. Therefore, there are \\(999 - 100 + 1 = 900\\) three-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Numbers without any 7 or 9**: \n   - For the hundreds digit, we can choose from 1 to 6 or 8 (7 choices).\n   - For the tens and units digits, we can choose from 0 to 6 or 8 (8 choices each).\n\n   Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers without any 7 or 9 is \\(7 \\times 8 \\times 8\\).\n\n3. **Numbers with at least one 7 or 9**: Subtract the count of numbers without any 7 or 9 from the total number of three-digit numbers.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Total number of three-digit numbers\ntotal_three_digit_numbers = 999 - 100 + 1\n\n# Numbers without any 7 or 9\nhundreds_choices = 7  # 1 to 6, 8\ntens_and_units_choices = 8  # 0 to 6, 8\n\nnumbers_without_7_or_9 = hundreds_choices * tens_and_units_choices * tens_and_units_choices\n\n# Numbers with at least one 7 or 9\nnumbers_with_7_or_9 = total_three_digit_numbers - numbers_without_7_or_9\nnumbers_with_7_or_9\nassistant > The number of three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits is <<<452>>>."
