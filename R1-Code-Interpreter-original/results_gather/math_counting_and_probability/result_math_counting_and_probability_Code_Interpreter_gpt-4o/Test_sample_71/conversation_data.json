    "\nassistant > To determine the number of ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes, we use the concept of combinations. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\). Let's calculate the number of combinations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Total number of classes\nn = 8\n# Number of classes to choose\nr = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\ncombinations = math.comb(n, r)\ncombinations\nassistant > The number of ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes is <<<56>>>."
