    "\nassistant > To find the number of perfect squares between 50 and 250, we need to determine the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\geq 50 \\) and the largest integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m^2 \\leq 250 \\). Then, the number of perfect squares will be the count of integers from \\( n \\) to \\( m \\), inclusive.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the smallest integer n such that n^2 >= 50\nn = math.ceil(math.sqrt(50))\n\n# Calculate the largest integer m such that m^2 <= 250\nm = math.floor(math.sqrt(250))\n\n# Count the number of perfect squares between n^2 and m^2\nnumber_of_perfect_squares = m - n + 1\nnumber_of_perfect_squares\nassistant > The number of perfect squares between 50 and 250 is <<<8>>>."
