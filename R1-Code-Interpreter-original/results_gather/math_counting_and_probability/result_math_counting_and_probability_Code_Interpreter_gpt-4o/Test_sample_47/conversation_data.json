    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the Lakers win the NBA finals in exactly 7 games. This means the series goes to 7 games, and the Lakers win the 7th game.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. The Lakers must win exactly 4 games, and the Celtics must win exactly 3 games in the first 6 games. This ensures that the series goes to a 7th game.\n\n2. The probability of the Lakers winning a single game is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), and the probability of the Celtics winning a single game is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n3. The number of ways to arrange 3 wins for the Celtics and 3 wins for the Lakers in the first 6 games is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\n4. The probability of any specific sequence of 3 wins for the Lakers and 3 wins for the Celtics in the first 6 games is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3\\).\n\n5. The Lakers must win the 7th game, which has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThe probability that the Lakers win the finals in exactly 7 games is the product of the number of ways to arrange the first 6 games, the probability of any specific sequence of those games, and the probability of the Lakers winning the 7th game.\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Probability of Lakers winning a single game\np_lakers = 1/3\n\n# Probability of Celtics winning a single game\np_celtics = 2/3\n\n# Number of ways to arrange 3 wins for each team in the first 6 games\nways_to_arrange = comb(6, 3)\n\n# Probability of any specific sequence of 3 wins for each team in the first 6 games\nprob_specific_sequence = (p_lakers**3) * (p_celtics**3)\n\n# Probability of Lakers winning the 7th game\nprob_lakers_win_7th = p_lakers\n\n# Total probability of Lakers winning in exactly 7 games\nprob_lakers_win_7_games = ways_to_arrange * prob_specific_sequence * prob_lakers_win_7th\nprob_lakers_win_7_games\nassistant > The probability that the Lakers will win the NBA finals in exactly 7 games is \\(\\frac{197}{2691}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.07315957933241879>>>"
