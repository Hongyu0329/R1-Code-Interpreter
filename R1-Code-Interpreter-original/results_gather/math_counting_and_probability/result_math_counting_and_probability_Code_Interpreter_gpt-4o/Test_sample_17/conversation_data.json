    "\nassistant > A four-digit palindrome has the form \\( abba \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are digits, and \\( a \\neq 0 \\) because it is a four-digit number. \n\n- The first digit \\( a \\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0).\n- The second digit \\( b \\) can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nThus, there are 9 choices for \\( a \\) and 10 choices for \\( b \\).\n\nThe total number of four-digit palindromes is the product of the number of choices for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Number of choices for the first digit (a)\nchoices_a = 9\n\n# Number of choices for the second digit (b)\nchoices_b = 10\n\n# Total number of four-digit palindromes\ntotal_palindromes = choices_a * choices_b\ntotal_palindromes\nassistant > The total number of positive four-digit integers that are palindromes is <<<90>>>."
