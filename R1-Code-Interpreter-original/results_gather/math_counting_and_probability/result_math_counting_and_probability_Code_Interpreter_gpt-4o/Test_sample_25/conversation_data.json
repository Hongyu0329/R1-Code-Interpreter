    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the lengths of segments \\(AD\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(CD\\) based on the given relationships, and then calculate the probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(AB = 3AD = 6BC\\)\n\nLet's denote the length of \\(AD\\) as \\(x\\). Then:\n\\[\nAB = 3AD = 3x\n\\]\n\nSince \\(AB = 6BC\\), we have:\n\\[\n6BC = 3x \\implies BC = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know:\n- \\(AB = 3x\\)\n- \\(AD = x\\)\n- \\(BC = \\frac{x}{2}\\)\n\nThe length of \\(CD\\) can be found by considering the positions of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\). Since \\(D\\) is at \\(x\\) and \\(C\\) is at \\(12 - \\frac{x}{2}\\), the length of \\(CD\\) is:\n\\[\nCD = CB - DB = \\left(AB - BC\\right) - AD = \\left(3x - \\frac{x}{2}\\right) - x = \\frac{3x}{2} - x = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is the ratio of the length of \\(\\overline{CD}\\) to the length of \\(\\overline{AB}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{CD}{AB} = \\frac{\\frac{x}{2}}{3x} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is <<<1/6>>>."
