    "\nassistant > To find the number of different positive four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, we need to consider the permutations of these digits.\n\nSince the digits 2 and 9 are repeated, we use the formula for permutations of multiset:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\ldots \\times n_k!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.\n\nIn this case, we have 4 digits in total, with the digit 2 appearing twice and the digit 9 appearing twice. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Total number of digits\nn = 4\n\n# Frequencies of the digits 2 and 9\nn1 = 2\nn2 = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of permutations\nnum_permutations = math.factorial(n) / (math.factorial(n1) * math.factorial(n2))\nnum_permutations\nassistant > It seems there was an internal error while trying to compute the result.

Let me fix that and perform the calculation again.# Re-import the math module and recalculate the number of permutations\nimport math\n\n# Total number of digits\nn = 4\n\n# Frequencies of the digits 2 and 9\nn1 = 2\nn2 = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of permutations\nnum_permutations = math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(n1) * math.factorial(n2))\nnum_permutations\nassistant > The number of different positive four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9 is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<6>>>."
