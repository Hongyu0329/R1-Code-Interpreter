    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the number of three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' and do not contain the digit '5'. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Total number of three-digit integers**: \n   - The smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999. \n   - Therefore, there are \\(999 - 100 + 1 = 900\\) three-digit integers.\n\n2. **Three-digit integers that do not contain the digit '5'**:\n   - For the hundreds place, the digits can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (8 choices).\n   - For the tens and units places, the digits can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (9 choices each).\n   - Therefore, the total number of three-digit integers without the digit '5' is \\(8 \\times 9 \\times 9\\).\n\n3. **Three-digit integers that do not contain the digit '5' and do not contain the digit '3'**:\n   - For the hundreds place, the digits can be 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (7 choices).\n   - For the tens and units places, the digits can be 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (8 choices each).\n   - Therefore, the total number of three-digit integers without the digits '5' and '3' is \\(7 \\times 8 \\times 8\\).\n\n4. **Three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' and do not contain a '5'**:\n   - This is the difference between the total number of three-digit integers without '5' and those without both '5' and '3'.\n   - Therefore, the number of integers we are looking for is \\((8 \\times 9 \\times 9) - (7 \\times 8 \\times 8)\\).\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the number of three-digit integers without the digit '5'\nwithout_5 = 8 * 9 * 9\n\n# Calculate the number of three-digit integers without the digits '5' and '3'\nwithout_5_and_3 = 7 * 8 * 8\n\n# Calculate the number of integers with at least one '3' and no '5'\nwith_3_no_5 = without_5 - without_5_and_3\nwith_3_no_5\nassistant > The number of positive three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' as a digit but do not contain a '5' as a digit is <<<200>>>."
