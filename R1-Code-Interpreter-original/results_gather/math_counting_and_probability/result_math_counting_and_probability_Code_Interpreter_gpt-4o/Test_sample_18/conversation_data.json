    "\nassistant > To determine the probability that a randomly arranged six-digit integer formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is divisible by 15, we need to check for divisibility by both 3 and 5.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since 0 is not available, the last digit must be 5.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 24\n   \\]\n   Since 24 is divisible by 3, any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\nGiven these conditions, the number must end in 5 to be divisible by 5, and the sum of the digits ensures divisibility by 3.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of permutations and the number of favorable permutations:\n\n- **Total permutations**: Since the digits include a repeated digit (5), the total number of permutations is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6!}{2!} = \\frac{720}{2} = 360\n  \\]\n\n- **Favorable permutations**: The number must end in 5. Fixing the last digit as 5, we arrange the remaining five digits (1, 2, 3, 5, 8). The number of permutations of these five digits, considering the repetition of 5, is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5!}{1!} = 120\n  \\]\n\nThe probability is then the ratio of favorable permutations to the total permutations:\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{360} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the integer is divisible by 15 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<1/3>>>"
