    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling six standard six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice is \\(6^6\\).\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**: To get six distinct numbers, each die must show a different number. The number of ways to arrange six distinct numbers (1 through 6) is the number of permutations of 6 distinct numbers, which is \\(6!\\).\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import factorial\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 6**6\n\n# Favorable outcomes (permutations of 6 distinct numbers)\nfavorable_outcomes = factorial(6)\n\n# Probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling six standard six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers is \\(\\frac{1}{65}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability expressed as a common fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{65}\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is: <<<1/65>>>."
