    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two chips drawn from the bag are of different colors. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of chips in the bag:\n\n- Blue chips: 5\n- Red chips: 4\n- Yellow chips: 3\n\nTotal number of chips = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12\n\nSince the chip is replaced after the first draw, the probability of drawing any chip remains the same for both draws.\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of drawing two chips of the same color:\n\n1. Probability of drawing two blue chips:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Blue, Blue}) = \\left(\\frac{5}{12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{12}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. Probability of drawing two red chips:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Red, Red}) = \\left(\\frac{4}{12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{12}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. Probability of drawing two yellow chips:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Yellow, Yellow}) = \\left(\\frac{3}{12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{12}\\right)\n   \\]\n\nThe probability of drawing two chips of the same color is the sum of these probabilities.\n\nFinally, the probability of drawing two chips of different colors is the complement of the probability of drawing two chips of the same color:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Different colors}) = 1 - P(\\text{Same color})\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Probabilities of drawing two chips of the same color\np_blue_blue = (5/12) * (5/12)\np_red_red = (4/12) * (4/12)\np_yellow_yellow = (3/12) * (3/12)\n\n# Probability of drawing two chips of the same color\np_same_color = p_blue_blue + p_red_red + p_yellow_yellow\n\n# Probability of drawing two chips of different colors\np_different_colors = 1 - p_same_color\n\n# Express the probability as a common fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\np_different_colors_fraction = Fraction(p_different_colors).limit_denominator()\n\np_different_colors_fraction\nassistant > The probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is \\(\\frac{47}{72}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<47/72>>>."
