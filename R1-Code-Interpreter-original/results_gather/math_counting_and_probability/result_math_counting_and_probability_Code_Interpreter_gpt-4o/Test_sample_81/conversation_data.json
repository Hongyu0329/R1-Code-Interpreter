    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a green ball from the randomly chosen container. \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Probability of Selecting Each Container:**\n   - There are three containers (A, B, and C), and each is equally likely to be chosen. Therefore, the probability of selecting any one container is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of Selecting a Green Ball from Each Container:**\n   - **Container A:** It has 4 red balls and 6 green balls, so the probability of selecting a green ball from container A is \\( \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n   - **Container B:** It has 6 red balls and 4 green balls, so the probability of selecting a green ball from container B is \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n   - **Container C:** It has 6 red balls and 4 green balls, so the probability of selecting a green ball from container C is \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n3. **Total Probability of Selecting a Green Ball:**\n   - We use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of selecting a green ball:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Green}) = P(\\text{Green | A}) \\cdot P(A) + P(\\text{Green | B}) \\cdot P(B) + P(\\text{Green | C}) \\cdot P(C)\n   \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Green}) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the total probability of selecting a green ball\nP_A = 1/3\nP_B = 1/3\nP_C = 1/3\n\nP_Green_A = 3/5\nP_Green_B = 2/5\nP_Green_C = 2/5\n\nP_Green = (P_Green_A * P_A) + (P_Green_B * P_B) + (P_Green_C * P_C)\nP_Green\nassistant > The probability of selecting a green ball is \\( \\frac{14}{30} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{7}{15} \\).\n\nThus, the probability that the ball selected is green is \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<7/15>>>."
