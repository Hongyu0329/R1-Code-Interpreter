    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of ways to seat the 7 children, and then subtract the number of ways in which no two boys are seated next to each other.\n\n1. **Total number of ways to seat 7 children:**\n\n   Since there are 7 children, the total number of ways to arrange them in a row is given by the factorial of 7:\n\n   \\[\n   7! = 5040\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways in which no two boys are seated next to each other:**\n\n   To ensure that no two boys are seated next to each other, we can first arrange the 3 girls. There are \\(3!\\) ways to arrange the girls:\n\n   \\[\n   3! = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Once the girls are seated, there are 4 gaps created between and at the ends of the girls (e.g., _G_G_G_). We need to place the 4 boys in these 4 gaps such that no two boys are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing 4 out of the 4 available gaps to place the boys, which can be done in:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{4} = 1\n   \\]\n\n   After choosing the gaps, the boys can be arranged among themselves in \\(4!\\) ways:\n\n   \\[\n   4! = 24\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the children such that no two boys are next to each other is:\n\n   \\[\n   3! \\times \\binom{4}{4} \\times 4! = 6 \\times 1 \\times 24 = 144\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of ways in which at least two boys are next to each other:**\n\n   Subtract the number of ways in which no two boys are next to each other from the total number of arrangements:\n\n   \\[\n   7! - (3! \\times \\binom{4}{4} \\times 4!) = 5040 - 144 = 4896\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to seat the Smith family's children such that at least two boys are next to each other is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4896}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4896>>>."
