    "\nassistant > To determine how many 3-digit mountain numbers exist, we need to consider the structure of a 3-digit number, which is represented as \\(abc\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are digits, and \\(a \\neq 0\\) since it's a 3-digit number.\n\nFor a number to be a mountain number, the middle digit \\(b\\) must be greater than both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). Therefore, we need to count the number of valid combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. \\(b\\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it must be greater than \\(a\\) and \\(a\\) is at least 1).\n2. For each value of \\(b\\), \\(a\\) can be any digit from 1 to \\(b-1\\).\n3. For each value of \\(b\\), \\(c\\) can be any digit from 0 to \\(b-1\\).\n\nWe will calculate the total number of such combinations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the number of 3-digit mountain numbers\ntotal_mountain_numbers = 0\n\n# Iterate over possible values of b (1 to 9)\nfor b in range(1, 10):\n    # a can be from 1 to b-1\n    count_a = b - 1\n    # c can be from 0 to b-1\n    count_c = b\n    # Total combinations for this b\n    total_mountain_numbers += count_a * count_c\n\ntotal_mountain_numbers\nassistant > The total number of 3-digit mountain numbers is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is <<<240>>>."
