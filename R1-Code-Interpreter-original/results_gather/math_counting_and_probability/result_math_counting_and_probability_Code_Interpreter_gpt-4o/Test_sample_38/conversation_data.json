    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen element from the first 15 rows of Pascal's Triangle is 1.\n\nPascal's Triangle is constructed such that each element is the sum of the two directly above it. The elements on the edges of the triangle are always 1. Therefore, in each row \\( n \\), the first and last elements are 1. \n\nLet's calculate the total number of elements in the first 15 rows (rows 0 through 14) and the number of elements that are 1.\n\n1. **Total Number of Elements:**\n   - Row \\( n \\) has \\( n+1 \\) elements.\n   - Total number of elements from row 0 to row 14 is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: \n     \\[\n     \\sum_{n=0}^{14} (n+1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 15\n     \\]\n\n2. **Number of Elements that are 1:**\n   - Each row has exactly two 1s (one at each end), except for row 0, which has only one 1.\n   - Total number of 1s is:\n     \\[\n     1 + 2 \\times 14 = 29\n     \\]\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - Probability that a randomly chosen element is 1 is the ratio of the number of 1s to the total number of elements.\n\nLet's compute these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the total number of elements in the first 15 rows of Pascal's Triangle\ntotal_elements = sum(n + 1 for n in range(15))\n\n# Calculate the total number of 1s in the first 15 rows\ntotal_ones = 1 + 2 * 14\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = total_ones / total_elements\ntotal_elements, total_ones, probability\nassistant > The total number of elements in the first 15 rows of Pascal's Triangle is 120, and the total number of elements that are 1 is 29. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen element is 1 is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{29}{120} \\approx 0.24167\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is approximately \\( 0.24167 \\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<0.24167>>>."
