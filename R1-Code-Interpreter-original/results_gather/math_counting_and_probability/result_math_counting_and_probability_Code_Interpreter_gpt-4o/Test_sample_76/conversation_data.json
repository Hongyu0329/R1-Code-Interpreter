    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is used to find the probability of having exactly \\( k \\) successes in \\( n \\) independent Bernoulli trials, each with a success probability of \\( p \\).\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 4 rolls).\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (in this case, rolling a 1 exactly 3 times).\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, the probability of rolling a 1, which is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)).\n\nLet's calculate the probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of trials\nn = 4\n\n# Number of successful trials\nk = 3\n\n# Probability of success on a single trial\np = 1/6\n\n# Calculate the probability using the binomial formula\nprobability = comb(n, k) * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(n-k))\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times when rolling a fair six-sided die four times is approximately \\(0.0154\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is <<<0.0154>>>."
