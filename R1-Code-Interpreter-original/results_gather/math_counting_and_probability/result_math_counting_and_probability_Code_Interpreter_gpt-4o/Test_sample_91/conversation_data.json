    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can choose 6 starters from the volleyball team, given that the three triplets (Alicia, Amanda, and Anna) must be included in the starting lineup.\n\n1. **Select the Triplets**: Since the triplets are already chosen to be in the starting lineup, we have 3 players already selected.\n\n2. **Choose the Remaining Players**: We need to choose 3 more players to complete the lineup of 6 starters. Since the triplets are already included, we have 14 - 3 = 11 players left to choose from.\n\n3. **Calculate the Combinations**: We need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 players from the remaining 11 players. This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of players to choose from, and \\( r \\) is the number of players to choose.\n\nLet's calculate the number of combinations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of players to choose from after selecting the triplets\nremaining_players = 11\n\n# Number of players to choose to complete the lineup\nplayers_to_choose = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\nnumber_of_ways = comb(remaining_players, players_to_choose)\nnumber_of_ways\nassistant > The number of ways to choose 6 starters, with all three triplets included, is \\(\\boxed{165}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<165>>>."
