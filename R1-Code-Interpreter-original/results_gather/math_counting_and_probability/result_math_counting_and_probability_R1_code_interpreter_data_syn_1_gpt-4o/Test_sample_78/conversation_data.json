    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that both balls drawn are white. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of ways to draw 2 balls from the box. The box contains 5 white balls and 6 black balls, making a total of 11 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 11 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways to draw 2 white balls from the 5 white balls. This is also given by the combination formula C(5, 2).\n\nThe probability that both balls drawn are white is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (drawing 2 white balls) to the total number of outcomes (drawing any 2 balls).\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of balls\ntotal_balls = 11\n\n# Number of white balls\nwhite_balls = 5\n\n# Total ways to draw 2 balls from 11\ntotal_ways = math.comb(total_balls, 2)\n\n# Ways to draw 2 white balls from 5\nwhite_ways = math.comb(white_balls, 2)\n\n# Probability that both balls are white\nprobability_white = white_ways / total_ways\n\nprint(probability_white)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability that both balls drawn are white. The probability is approximately 0.1818.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.1818>>>"
