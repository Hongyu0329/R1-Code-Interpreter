    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways there are to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, we need to consider the nature of the problem:\n\n1. **Distinguishable Balls**: Each ball is unique, so the order in which they are placed matters.\n2. **Indistinguishable Boxes**: The boxes are not unique, meaning that swapping the contents of the boxes does not create a new arrangement.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can approach the problem by considering the different ways to distribute the balls into the boxes:\n\n- All 4 balls in one box and 0 in the other.\n- 3 balls in one box and 1 in the other.\n- 2 balls in each box.\n\nFor each of these distributions, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose which balls go into which box, and then account for the indistinguishability of the boxes.\n\nLet's calculate each case:\n\n1. **All 4 balls in one box**: There is only 1 way to do this because the boxes are indistinguishable.\n\n2. **3 balls in one box and 1 in the other**: \n   - Choose 3 balls out of 4 to put in one box. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(4, 3).\n   - Since the boxes are indistinguishable, each selection of 3 balls is unique.\n\n3. **2 balls in each box**:\n   - Choose 2 balls out of 4 to put in one box. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(4, 2).\n   - Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to divide by 2 to account for swapping the boxes.\n\nLet's compute these values using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Case 1: All 4 balls in one box\ncase1 = 1\n\n# Case 2: 3 balls in one box, 1 in the other\ncase2 = comb(4, 3)\n\n# Case 3: 2 balls in each box\ncase3 = comb(4, 2) // 2\n\n# Total number of ways\ntotal_ways = case1 + case2 + case3\n\nprint(total_ways)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the total number of ways.",
    "The code execution has provided the result, which indicates the total number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. The calculation considered all possible distributions and accounted for the indistinguishability of the boxes.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
