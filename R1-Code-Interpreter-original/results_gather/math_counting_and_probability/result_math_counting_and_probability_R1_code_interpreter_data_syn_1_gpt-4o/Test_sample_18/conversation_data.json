    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly arranged six-digit integer formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is divisible by 15. A number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.\n\n**Step 1: Check divisibility by 5.**\nA number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since we don't have a 0, the last digit must be 5. We have two 5s available, so the last digit can be 5.\n\n**Step 2: Check divisibility by 3.**\nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 24 \\]\nSince 24 is divisible by 3, any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of permutations.**\nThe total number of permutations of the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is given by the formula for permutations of multiset:\n\\[ \\frac{6!}{2!} \\]\nwhere 6! is the factorial of the total number of digits, and 2! accounts for the repetition of the digit 5.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of favorable permutations.**\nSince the number must end in 5, we fix one 5 at the end and permute the remaining 5 digits (1, 2, 3, 5, 8):\n\\[ \\frac{5!}{1!} \\]\nwhere 5! is the factorial of the remaining digits, and 1! accounts for the repetition of the remaining 5.\n\nNow, let's calculate these values using Python to find the probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total permutations of the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 8\ntotal_permutations = math.factorial(6) // math.factorial(2)\n\n# Favorable permutations with last digit fixed as 5\nfavorable_permutations = math.factorial(5) // math.factorial(1)\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = favorable_permutations / total_permutations\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the probability is approximately 0.3333. This can be expressed as a common fraction.\n\nThe probability that a randomly arranged six-digit integer formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8 is divisible by 15 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
