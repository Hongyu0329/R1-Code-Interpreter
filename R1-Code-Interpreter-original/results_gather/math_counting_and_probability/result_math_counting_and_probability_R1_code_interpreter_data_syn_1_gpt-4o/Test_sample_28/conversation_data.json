    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of points on the number line from 0 to 5 that are closer to 4 than to 0. \n\n1. **Identify the midpoint**: The point on the number line that is equidistant from 0 and 4 is the midpoint. The midpoint between 0 and 4 is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Midpoint} = \\frac{0 + 4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the range**: Points that are closer to 4 than to 0 will be those greater than 2. Therefore, the range of points closer to 4 than to 0 is from 2 to 5.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability**: The total length of the number line from 0 to 5 is 5 units. The length of the segment from 2 to 5 is 3 units. The probability that a randomly selected point is closer to 4 than to 0 is the ratio of the length of the segment from 2 to 5 to the total length of the number line.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Length of segment from 2 to 5}}{\\text{Total length of number line}} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected point is closer to 4 than to 0 is 0.6.\n\n<<<0.6>>>"
