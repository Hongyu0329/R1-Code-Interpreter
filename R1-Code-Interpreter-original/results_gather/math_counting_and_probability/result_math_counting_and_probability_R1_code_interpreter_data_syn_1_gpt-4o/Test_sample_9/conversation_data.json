    "To find \\(\\binom{25}{5}\\), we can use Pascal's identity, which states:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}\n\\]\n\nWe need to express \\(\\binom{25}{5}\\) in terms of known binomial coefficients. We can use the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{25}{5} = \\binom{24}{4} + \\binom{24}{5}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we don't have \\(\\binom{24}{4}\\) and \\(\\binom{24}{5}\\) directly. We can express these in terms of \\(\\binom{23}{3}\\), \\(\\binom{23}{4}\\), and \\(\\binom{23}{5}\\) using Pascal's identity again:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{24}{4} = \\binom{23}{3} + \\binom{23}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate \\(\\binom{25}{5}\\) using these expressions:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{25}{5} = (\\binom{23}{3} + \\binom{23}{4}) + (\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5})\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this using the given values:\n\n- \\(\\binom{23}{3} = 1771\\)\n- \\(\\binom{23}{4} = 8855\\)\n- \\(\\binom{23}{5} = 33649\\)\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{25}{5} = (1771 + 8855) + (8855 + 33649)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Given values\nC_23_3 = 1771\nC_23_4 = 8855\nC_23_5 = 33649\n\n# Calculate C_24_4 and C_24_5\nC_24_4 = C_23_3 + C_23_4\nC_24_5 = C_23_4 + C_23_5\n\n# Calculate C_25_5\nC_25_5 = C_24_4 + C_24_5\n\n# Output the result\nprint(C_25_5)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(\\binom{25}{5}\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 53130. This means that the value of \\(\\binom{25}{5}\\) is 53130.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<53130>>>"
