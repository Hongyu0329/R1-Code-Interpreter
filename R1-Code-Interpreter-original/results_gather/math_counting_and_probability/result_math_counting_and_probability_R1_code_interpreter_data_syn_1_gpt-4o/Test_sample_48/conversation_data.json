    "To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the numbers in Row 8 of Pascal's Triangle. \n\nIn Pascal's Triangle, each row corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion. The sum of the numbers in any row of Pascal's Triangle is equal to \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the row number starting from 0. \n\nFor example:\n- Row 0: \\(2^0 = 1\\)\n- Row 1: \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n- Row 2: \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- Row 3: \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n- Row 4: \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n- Row 5: \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n\nTherefore, for Row 8, the sum of the numbers will be \\(2^8\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(2^8\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of numbers in Row 8 of Pascal's Triangle\nrow_number = 8\nsum_of_row = 2 ** row_number\nprint(sum_of_row)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the sum.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the sum of the numbers in Row 8 of Pascal's Triangle as 256. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the numbers in Row 8 is:\n\n<<<256>>>"
