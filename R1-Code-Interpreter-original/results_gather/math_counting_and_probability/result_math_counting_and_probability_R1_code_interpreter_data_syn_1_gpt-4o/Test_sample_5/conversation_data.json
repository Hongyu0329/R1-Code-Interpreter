    "To find the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in the expansion of \\((x-1)^9\\), we can use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(a = x\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(n = 9\\). We are interested in the term where the power of \\(x\\) is 8, which means we need to find the term where \\(n-k = 8\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nn-k = 8 \\implies 9-k = 8 \\implies k = 1\n\\]\n\nThe term in the expansion corresponding to \\(k = 1\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{1} x^{9-1} (-1)^1\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this term to find the coefficient of \\(x^8\\).\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\nn = 9\nk = 1\na = 1  # Coefficient of x\nb = -1  # Coefficient of -1\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient\nbinomial_coefficient = comb(n, k)\n\n# Calculate the term\nterm_coefficient = binomial_coefficient * (a ** (n - k)) * (b ** k)\n\nprint(term_coefficient)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the coefficient.",
    "The code execution confirms that the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in the expansion of \\((x-1)^9\\) is \\(-9\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-9>>>"
