    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of ways to seat the Smith family's 4 sons and 3 daughters in a row of 7 chairs, ensuring that at least 2 boys are next to each other.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange all 7 children without any restrictions. This is simply the number of permutations of 7 distinct people:\n\n\\[ 7! = 5040 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to arrange them such that no two boys are next to each other. To do this, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Arrange the 3 daughters first. There are \\(3!\\) ways to do this.\n2. Once the daughters are seated, there are 4 gaps created around them (before the first daughter, between daughters, and after the last daughter) where the boys can be seated.\n3. We need to choose 4 out of these 4 gaps to place the 4 boys, ensuring no two boys are adjacent. This can be done in \\( \\binom{4}{4} \\) ways, which is 1 way.\n4. Finally, arrange the 4 boys in these 4 chosen gaps. There are \\(4!\\) ways to do this.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the children such that no two boys are next to each other is:\n\n\\[ 3! \\times \\binom{4}{4} \\times 4! \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of ways where at least 2 boys are next to each other by subtracting the above result from the total number of arrangements:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total ways with at least 2 boys together} = 7! - (3! \\times \\binom{4}{4} \\times 4!) \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total permutations of 7 children\ntotal_permutations = math.factorial(7)\n\n# Permutations where no two boys are adjacent\ndaughters_permutations = math.factorial(3)\nboys_permutations = math.factorial(4)\nno_adjacent_boys = daughters_permutations * boys_permutations\n\n# Calculate the number of ways with at least 2 boys together\nat_least_two_boys_together = total_permutations - no_adjacent_boys\n\nprint(at_least_two_boys_together)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of ways the children can be seated such that at least 2 boys are next to each other.",
    "The code execution has provided the result, which is the number of ways to seat the Smith family's children such that at least two boys are next to each other. \n\nThe calculation involved:\n- Total permutations of all children: \\(7!\\)\n- Subtracting the permutations where no two boys are adjacent, calculated as \\(3! \\times 4!\\).\n\nThe final result is:\n\n<<<4896>>>"
