    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the probability of an event happening and not happening. The probability of an event not happening is the complement of the probability of the event happening. \n\nGiven:\n- Probability of rain tomorrow, \\( P(\\text{rain}) = \\frac{3}{10} \\).\n\nThe probability that it will not rain tomorrow is the complement of the probability that it will rain. This can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{not rain}) = 1 - P(\\text{rain}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given probability:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{not rain}) = 1 - \\frac{3}{10} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given probability of rain\nprob_rain = 3/10\n\n# Calculate probability of not rain\nprob_not_rain = 1 - prob_rain\n\n# Output the result\nprint(prob_not_rain)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the probability that it will not rain tomorrow.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the probability that it will not rain tomorrow as 0.7. Since the problem asks for the answer to be expressed as a common fraction, we need to convert 0.7 into a fraction.\n\n0.7 can be expressed as \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\) in fractional form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it will not rain tomorrow is \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\).\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{7}{10}\\)>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
