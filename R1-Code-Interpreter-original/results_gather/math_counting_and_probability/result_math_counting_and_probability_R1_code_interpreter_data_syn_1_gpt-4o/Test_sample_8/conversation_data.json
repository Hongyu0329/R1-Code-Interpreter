    "To solve the expression \\(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\\), we can recognize that it resembles the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\), which is given by:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\n\\]\n\nIn this case, if we let \\(a = 99\\) and \\(b = 1\\), the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(99 + 1)^3 = 99^3 + 3 \\cdot 99^2 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 99 \\cdot 1^2 + 1^3\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given expression exactly. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(99 + 1)^3 = 100^3\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\(100^3\\). Let's compute this using Python for accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate 100^3\nresult = 100 ** 3\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(100^3\\).",
    "The calculation of \\(100^3\\) results in \\(1,000,000\\). Therefore, the value of the expression \\(99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1\\) is:\n\n<<<1000000>>>"
