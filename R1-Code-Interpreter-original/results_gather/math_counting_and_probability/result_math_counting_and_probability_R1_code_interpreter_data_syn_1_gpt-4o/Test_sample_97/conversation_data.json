    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a cube, with each face painted either red or blue independently with a probability of 1/2, can be oriented such that all four vertical faces are the same color.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Total Number of Paintings**: \n   - Each face of the cube can be painted in 2 ways (red or blue).\n   - Since there are 6 faces, the total number of ways to paint the cube is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n2. **Favorable Orientations**:\n   - For the cube to have all four vertical faces the same color, the top and bottom faces must be the same color, and the four side faces must be the same color.\n   - There are two scenarios for the top and bottom faces: both red or both blue.\n   - For each scenario, the four side faces can either be all red or all blue.\n\n3. **Counting Favorable Outcomes**:\n   - If the top and bottom faces are red, the four side faces can be all red or all blue. This gives us 2 favorable outcomes.\n   - Similarly, if the top and bottom faces are blue, the four side faces can be all red or all blue. This gives us another 2 favorable outcomes.\n   - Therefore, there are \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) favorable outcomes.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Total number of ways to paint the cube\ntotal_paintings = 2**6\n\n# Favorable outcomes: 2 scenarios for top and bottom, each with 2 options for sides\nfavorable_outcomes = 2 * 2\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_paintings\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the probability value.",
    "The code execution confirms that the probability of the painted cube being oriented such that all four vertical faces are the same color is 0.0625. \n\nThis result is derived from the fact that there are 4 favorable outcomes (2 scenarios for the top and bottom faces, each with 2 options for the side faces) out of a total of 64 possible ways to paint the cube.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0625>>>"
