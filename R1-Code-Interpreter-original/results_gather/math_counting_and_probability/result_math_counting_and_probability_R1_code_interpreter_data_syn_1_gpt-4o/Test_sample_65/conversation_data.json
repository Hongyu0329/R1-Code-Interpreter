    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers on three rolled dice equals 16. \n\nFirst, let's consider the possible outcomes when rolling three dice. Each die has 6 faces, so there are a total of \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\) possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the numbers on the three dice equals 16. The possible combinations of numbers on the dice that sum to 16 are limited because the maximum sum with three dice is 18 (if each die shows a 6).\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n- (6, 6, 4)\n- (6, 4, 6)\n- (4, 6, 6)\n- (5, 5, 6)\n- (5, 6, 5)\n- (6, 5, 5)\n\nEach of these combinations can occur in different permutations. We will calculate the number of permutations for each combination and sum them up to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the probability.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the possible combinations that sum to 16\ncombinations = [(6, 6, 4), (6, 4, 6), (4, 6, 6), (5, 5, 6), (5, 6, 5), (6, 5, 5)]\n\n# Use a set to avoid counting duplicate permutations\nunique_permutations = set()\n\n# Calculate all unique permutations of each combination\nfor combo in combinations:\n    unique_permutations.update(permutations(combo))\n\n# Total number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = len(unique_permutations)\n\n# Total possible outcomes when rolling three dice\ntotal_outcomes = 6 ** 3\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability that the sum of the numbers on three rolled dice equals 16. The probability is approximately 0.0278.\n\nNow, let's express this probability as a fraction for a more precise answer. The probability of 0.027777777777777776 can be expressed as a fraction of 1/36.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the face-up integers is 16 when three standard 6-faced dice are rolled is:\n\n<<<1/36>>>"
