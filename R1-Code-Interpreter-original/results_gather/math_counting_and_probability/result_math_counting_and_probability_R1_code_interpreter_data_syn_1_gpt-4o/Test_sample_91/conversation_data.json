    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can choose 6 starters from the volleyball team, given that the three triplets (Alicia, Amanda, and Anna) must be included in the starting lineup.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Include the Triplets**: Since Alicia, Amanda, and Anna must be in the starting lineup, they automatically occupy 3 of the 6 starting positions.\n\n2. **Choose Remaining Players**: We need to choose the remaining 3 players from the rest of the team. The team has 14 players in total, and 3 of them are the triplets. Therefore, there are \\(14 - 3 = 11\\) players left to choose from.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations**: We need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 players from these 11 players. This is a combinations problem, which can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(n\\) is the total number of players to choose from, and \\(k\\) is the number of players to choose.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total players to choose from (excluding the triplets)\nn = 11\n\n# Number of players to choose\nk = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\ncombinations = math.comb(n, k)\n\nprint(combinations)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of ways to choose 3 players from the remaining 11 players. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the number of ways to choose 3 players from the remaining 11 players, which is 165.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose 6 starters, including the triplets, is 165.\n\n<<<165>>>"
