    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of the bottling plant bottling chocolate milk exactly 4 out of the 5 days Robert visits. This is a binomial probability problem where:\n\n- The number of trials \\( n = 5 \\).\n- The probability of success (bottling chocolate milk) on any given day \\( p = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n- The probability of failure (bottling regular milk) on any given day \\( q = 1 - p = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n- We want exactly \\( k = 4 \\) successes (days with chocolate milk).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot q^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Parameters\nn = 5\nk = 4\np = 2/3\nq = 1 - p\n\n# Binomial coefficient\nbinom_coeff = math.comb(n, k)\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = binom_coeff * (p ** k) * (q ** (n - k))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 out of the 5 days Robert visits. The result is approximately 0.3292.\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n<<<0.3292>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
