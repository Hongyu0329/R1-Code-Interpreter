    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many three-digit numbers have at least one digit as 7 or 9. \n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of three-digit numbers. A three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999, inclusive. Therefore, there are:\n\n\\[ 999 - 100 + 1 = 900 \\]\n\nthree-digit numbers in total.\n\nNext, we will use the principle of complementary counting. Instead of directly counting the numbers that have at least one 7 or 9, we will count the numbers that do not have any 7 or 9 and subtract this from the total.\n\nFor a number to not have any 7 or 9:\n- The hundreds digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, except 7 and 9. So, there are 7 choices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).\n- The tens digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except 7 and 9. So, there are 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).\n- The units digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except 7 and 9. So, there are 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).\n\nThus, the number of three-digit numbers without any 7 or 9 is:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 8 \\times 8 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this and subtract from the total number of three-digit numbers to find the count of numbers with at least one 7 or 9.\n\n```python\n# Total number of three-digit numbers\ntotal_numbers = 999 - 100 + 1\n\n# Number of three-digit numbers without any 7 or 9\nwithout_7_or_9 = 7 * 8 * 8\n\n# Number of three-digit numbers with at least one 7 or 9\nwith_7_or_9 = total_numbers - without_7_or_9\n\nprint(with_7_or_9)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result. Based on the calculations, the number of three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits is 452.\n\n<<<452>>>"
