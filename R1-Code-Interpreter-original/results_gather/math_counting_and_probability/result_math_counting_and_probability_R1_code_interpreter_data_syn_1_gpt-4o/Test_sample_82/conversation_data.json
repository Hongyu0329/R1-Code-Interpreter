    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the indistinguishability of the groups. We have 3 men and 4 women, and we need to form two groups of two people and one group of three people, with each group containing at least one man and one woman.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Group Composition**: \n   - Two groups of two people each.\n   - One group of three people.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each group must have at least one man and one woman.\n   - Identically sized groups are indistinguishable.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - First, choose the group of three people. This group must have at least one man and one woman.\n   - The remaining people will form the two groups of two, each also needing at least one man and one woman.\n\nLet's calculate the number of ways to form these groups:\n\n- **Step 1**: Choose the group of three people.\n  - This group can have either 1 man and 2 women or 2 men and 1 woman.\n\n- **Step 2**: Calculate the number of ways for each scenario.\n\n- **Step 3**: For each scenario, calculate the number of ways to form the remaining two groups of two people.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to calculate the number of ways:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of men and women\nmen = 3\nwomen = 4\n\n# Scenario 1: Group of 3 has 1 man and 2 women\nways_1_man_2_women = comb(men, 1) * comb(women, 2)\n\n# Remaining: 2 men and 2 women\n# Form two groups of 2, each with 1 man and 1 woman\nways_2_groups_1_man_1_woman = comb(2, 1) * comb(2, 1)\n\n# Total ways for scenario 1\ntotal_ways_scenario_1 = ways_1_man_2_women * ways_2_groups_1_man_1_woman\n\n# Scenario 2: Group of 3 has 2 men and 1 woman\nways_2_men_1_woman = comb(men, 2) * comb(women, 1)\n\n# Remaining: 1 man and 3 women\n# Form two groups of 2, each with 1 man and 1 woman\nways_2_groups_1_man_1_woman_scenario_2 = comb(1, 1) * comb(3, 1)\n\n# Total ways for scenario 2\ntotal_ways_scenario_2 = ways_2_men_1_woman * ways_2_groups_1_man_1_woman_scenario_2\n\n# Total ways\ntotal_ways = total_ways_scenario_1 + total_ways_scenario_2\n\nprint(total_ways)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the number of ways to form the groups under the given constraints. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output. Based on the calculations, the total number of ways to arrange 3 men and 4 women into two groups of two people and one group of three people, with each group containing at least one man and one woman, is 108.\n\n<<<108>>>"
