    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the winnings from a single coin flip. The expected value (EV) is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing these products.\n\nLet's define the outcomes and their probabilities:\n- The probability of flipping heads (H) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n- The probability of flipping tails (T) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nThe winnings for each outcome are:\n- If heads, we win $3.\n- If tails, we lose $2.\n\nThe expected value (EV) is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \nEV = (P(H) \\times W(H)) + (P(T) \\times W(T))\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( P(H) = \\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( W(H) = 3 \\)\n- \\( P(T) = \\frac{2}{3} \\) and \\( W(T) = -2 \\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\\[ \nEV = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times -2\\right)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define probabilities and winnings\nprob_heads = 1/3\nwinnings_heads = 3\nprob_tails = 2/3\nwinnings_tails = -2\n\n# Calculate expected value\nexpected_value = (prob_heads * winnings_heads) + (prob_tails * winnings_tails)\nprint(expected_value)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the expected value.",
    "The code output indicates that the expected value of the winnings after one flip is approximately \\(-0.3333\\). This value can be expressed as a common fraction. Since the decimal \\(-0.3333\\) is equivalent to \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), the expected value in fractional form is \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the expected value of our winnings after one flip is \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\) dollars.\n\n<<<-1/3>>>"
