    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 different marbles from a set of 7 different colored marbles. This is a classic combination problem where the order of selection does not matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\). Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of marbles\nn = 7\n# Number of marbles to choose\nk = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\ncombinations = math.comb(n, k)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(combinations)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of ways Johnny can choose 3 marbles from 7.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the number of combinations correctly. The number of ways Johnny can choose 3 different marbles from a set of 7 different colored marbles is 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
