    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the number on the coin and the number on the die equals 14, Erika's age.\n\n1. **Coin Flip Outcomes**: The coin has two sides, labeled 10 and 20. So, there are two possible outcomes for the coin flip: 10 or 20.\n\n2. **Die Roll Outcomes**: A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. So, there are six possible outcomes for the die roll.\n\n3. **Possible Sums**: \n   - If the coin shows 10, the possible sums with the die are: 10+1, 10+2, 10+3, 10+4, 10+5, 10+6.\n   - If the coin shows 20, the possible sums with the die are: 20+1, 20+2, 20+3, 20+4, 20+5, 20+6.\n\n4. **Target Sum**: We are interested in the cases where the sum equals 14.\n\n5. **Calculate Favorable Outcomes**:\n   - For the coin showing 10: The sum 14 can be achieved with the die showing 4 (10+4=14).\n   - For the coin showing 20: The sum 14 cannot be achieved because the smallest sum is 21 (20+1).\n\n6. **Total Possible Outcomes**: Since there are 2 outcomes for the coin and 6 outcomes for the die, there are a total of 2 * 6 = 12 possible outcomes.\n\n7. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 2 * 6\n\n# Favorable outcomes: Coin shows 10 and die shows 4\nfavorable_outcomes = 1\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the probability that the sum of the coin flip and die roll equals Erika's age, 14. The probability is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\), which is approximately 0.0833 in decimal form.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum equals Erika's age is:\n\n<<<1/12>>>"
