    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of 4-letter words that can be formed from the given letters and then subtract the number of 4-letter words that contain no vowels.\n\n1. **Total number of 4-letter words**: Since each position in the word can be filled by any of the 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E), the total number of 4-letter words is \\(5^4\\).\n\n2. **Number of 4-letter words with no vowels**: The consonants available are B, C, and D. So, each position in the word can be filled by any of these 3 letters, resulting in \\(3^4\\) words with no vowels.\n\n3. **Number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel**: This is the total number of 4-letter words minus the number of 4-letter words with no vowels.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of 4-letter words\ntotal_words = 5**4\n\n# Number of 4-letter words with no vowels\nno_vowel_words = 3**4\n\n# Number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel\nat_least_one_vowel = total_words - no_vowel_words\n\nprint(at_least_one_vowel)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result. The number of 4-letter words that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E, with at least one vowel, is 544.\n\n<<<544>>>"
