    "To solve the problem of distributing 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, we need to consider the partitions of the number 4. Since the boxes are indistinguishable, different permutations of the same partition are considered the same.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1. 4 = 4\n2. 4 = 3 + 1\n3. 4 = 2 + 2\n4. 4 = 2 + 1 + 1\n5. 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nHowever, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to consider only unique distributions:\n1. All balls in one box: (4, 0)\n2. Three balls in one box, one in the other: (3, 1)\n3. Two balls in each box: (2, 2)\n\nLet's count these cases:\n- (4, 0) and (0, 4) are the same due to indistinguishable boxes.\n- (3, 1) and (1, 3) are the same due to indistinguishable boxes.\n- (2, 2) is inherently symmetric.\n\nThus, there are 3 unique ways to distribute the balls.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our reasoning is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\n# Number of balls\nn = 4\n# Number of boxes\nk = 2\n\n# Generate all possible distributions of balls into boxes\ndistributions = list(combinations_with_replacement(range(k), n))\n\n# Convert distributions to counts of balls in each box\nunique_distributions = set()\nfor dist in distributions:\n    count = [dist.count(i) for i in range(k)]\n    unique_distributions.add(tuple(sorted(count, reverse=True)))\n\n# Since boxes are indistinguishable, we only count unique distributions\nprint(len(unique_distributions))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of unique ways to distribute the balls into the boxes, considering the indistinguishability of the boxes.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning that there are 3 unique ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. The unique distributions are:\n1. All balls in one box.\n2. Three balls in one box and one in the other.\n3. Two balls in each box.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
