    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the division \\( r \\div k \\) results in an integer, given the constraints on \\( r \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Range of Values\n\n- \\( r \\) is an integer such that \\(-3 < r < 6\\). Therefore, the possible values for \\( r \\) are \\(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n- \\( k \\) is an integer such that \\(1 < k < 8\\). Therefore, the possible values for \\( k \\) are \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Number of Outcomes\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of possible values for \\( r \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine Favorable Outcomes\n\nWe need to find the number of pairs \\((r, k)\\) such that \\( r \\div k \\) is an integer. This means \\( r \\) must be divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nLet's check each possible value of \\( k \\) and see which values of \\( r \\) are divisible by \\( k \\).\n\n- For \\( k = 2 \\), \\( r \\) can be \\(-2, 0, 2, 4\\).\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( r \\) can be \\(0, 3\\).\n- For \\( k = 4 \\), \\( r \\) can be \\(0, 4\\).\n- For \\( k = 5 \\), \\( r \\) can be \\(0, 5\\).\n- For \\( k = 6 \\), \\( r \\) can be \\(0\\).\n- For \\( k = 7 \\), \\( r \\) can be \\(0\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of favorable outcomes using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Possible values for r and k\nr_values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nk_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n# Count favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\nfor k in k_values:\n    for r in r_values:\n        if r % k == 0:\n            favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Total outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = len(r_values) * len(k_values)\n\n# Probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the probability that \\( r \\div k \\) is an integer.\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the probability as a common fraction. Let's see the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability that the division \\( r \\div k \\) results in an integer value. The probability is expressed as a common fraction.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1/4>>>"
