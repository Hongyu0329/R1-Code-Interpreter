    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the number of its diagonals.\n\n1. **Number of Sides (n):** A regular polygon has 'n' sides.\n\n2. **Number of Diagonals (D):** The formula to calculate the number of diagonals in a polygon is:\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Given Condition:** The number of diagonals is subtracted from the number of sides, and the result is zero. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n - D = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the formula for diagonals, we have:\n   \\[\n   n - \\frac{n(n-3)}{2} = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for n:** We need to solve this equation to find the value of 'n'.\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python to find the number of sides of the polygon.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nn = symbols('n', integer=True, positive=True)\n\n# Define the equation based on the given condition\nequation = Eq(n - (n * (n - 3)) / 2, 0)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of 'n' that satisfies the condition.",
    "The code output indicates that the number of sides of the polygon is 5. This means that when the number of diagonals of a polygon with 5 sides is subtracted from the number of sides, the result is zero.\n\nTherefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
