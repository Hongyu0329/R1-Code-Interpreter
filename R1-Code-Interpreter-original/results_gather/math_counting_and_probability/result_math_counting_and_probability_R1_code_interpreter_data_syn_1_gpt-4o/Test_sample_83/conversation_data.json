    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that two randomly selected different natural numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) have a greatest common factor (GCF) of 1. This means that the two numbers are coprime.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to select two different numbers from the set.**\n\nThe set has 6 elements, and we need to choose 2 different numbers. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of elements, and \\(k\\) is the number of elements to choose.\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of coprime pairs.**\n\nTwo numbers are coprime if their GCF is 1. We will list all pairs and check their GCF.\n\n- Pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nNow, let's calculate the GCF for each pair and count the coprime pairs.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# List of pairs\npairs = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), \n         (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), \n         (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), \n         (4, 5), (4, 6), \n         (5, 6)]\n\n# Count coprime pairs\ncoprime_count = sum(1 for a, b in pairs if math.gcd(a, b) == 1)\n\n# Total number of pairs\ntotal_pairs = len(pairs)\n\n# Probability\nprobability = coprime_count / total_pairs\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the number of coprime pairs and the probability that two randomly selected numbers are coprime.\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the probability as a fraction.\n\n<<<\\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}>>>",

    "I apologize for the oversight.
