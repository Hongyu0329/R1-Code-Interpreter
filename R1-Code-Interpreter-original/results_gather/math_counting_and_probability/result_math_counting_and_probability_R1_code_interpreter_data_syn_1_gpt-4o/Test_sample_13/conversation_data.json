    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two randomly chosen cards from a standard 52-card deck are both numbers (2 through 10) and their sum is 12.\n\nFirst, let's identify the possible pairs of cards that can sum to 12:\n- 2 and 10\n- 3 and 9\n- 4 and 8\n- 5 and 7\n- 6 and 6\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to draw each of these pairs from the deck. Each number (2 through 10) appears 4 times in a deck (one for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).\n\n1. For the pair (2, 10), there are 4 ways to choose a 2 and 4 ways to choose a 10, giving us 4 * 4 = 16 ways.\n2. For the pair (3, 9), there are 4 ways to choose a 3 and 4 ways to choose a 9, giving us 4 * 4 = 16 ways.\n3. For the pair (4, 8), there are 4 ways to choose a 4 and 4 ways to choose an 8, giving us 4 * 4 = 16 ways.\n4. For the pair (5, 7), there are 4 ways to choose a 5 and 4 ways to choose a 7, giving us 4 * 4 = 16 ways.\n5. For the pair (6, 6), there are 4 ways to choose the first 6 and 3 ways to choose the second 6 (since one 6 is already chosen), giving us 4 * 3 = 12 ways.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of favorable outcomes by summing up all these possibilities.\n\nFinally, the total number of ways to choose any 2 cards from a 52-card deck is given by the combination formula C(52, 2).\n\nThe probability is then the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = (4 * 4) + (4 * 4) + (4 * 4) + (4 * 4) + (4 * 3)\n\n# Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from 52\ntotal_outcomes = comb(52, 2)\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have the probability that two randomly chosen cards from a standard 52-card deck are both numbers (2 through 10) and their sum is 12.\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.0573.\n\n<<<0.0573>>>"
