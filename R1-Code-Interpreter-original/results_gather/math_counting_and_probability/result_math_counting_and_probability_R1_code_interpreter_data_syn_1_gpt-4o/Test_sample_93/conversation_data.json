    "To solve the problem of computing \\( \\frac{42!}{40!} \\), we can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factorial terms.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding Factorials**: \n   - \\( 42! \\) (42 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 42.\n   - \\( 40! \\) (40 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 40.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Expression**:\n   - The expression \\( \\frac{42!}{40!} \\) can be simplified by canceling out the \\( 40! \\) part from both the numerator and the denominator.\n   - This leaves us with \\( 42 \\times 41 \\) because:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{42!}{40!} = \\frac{42 \\times 41 \\times 40!}{40!} = 42 \\times 41\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Result**:\n   - We need to compute the product of 42 and 41.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the product of 42 and 41\nresult = 42 * 41\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the result of the computation.",
    "The calculation of \\( \\frac{42!}{40!} \\) simplifies to \\( 42 \\times 41 \\), which equals 1722. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1722>>>"
