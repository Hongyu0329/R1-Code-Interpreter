    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of getting exactly two heads in six coin tosses. \n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - Each coin toss has 2 possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).\n   - Therefore, for 6 tosses, the total number of possible outcomes is \\(2^6\\).\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**:\n   - We need to find the number of sequences with exactly 2 heads.\n   - This is a combination problem where we choose 2 positions for heads out of 6 tosses.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 positions from 6 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The probability of getting exactly 2 heads is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of outcomes for 6 coin tosses\ntotal_outcomes = 2**6\n\n# Number of favorable outcomes (exactly 2 heads)\nfavorable_outcomes = comb(6, 2)\n\n# Probability as a fraction\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n\n# Expressing the probability as a common fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability_fraction = Fraction(probability).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(probability_fraction)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability and express it as a common fraction. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the probability as a common fraction. The probability of getting exactly two heads in six coin tosses is \\(\\frac{15}{64}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<15/64>>>"
