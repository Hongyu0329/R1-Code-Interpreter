    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of two-digit numbers where the tens digit is greater than the ones digit. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. A two-digit number can be represented as \\(10a + b\\), where \\(a\\) is the tens digit and \\(b\\) is the ones digit.\n2. The tens digit \\(a\\) can range from 1 to 9 (since 0 would make it a one-digit number).\n3. The ones digit \\(b\\) can range from 0 to 9.\n4. We need to find the count of numbers where \\(a > b\\).\n\nTo find the solution, we can iterate over all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and count the cases where \\(a > b\\).\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nfor a in range(1, 10):  # tens digit from 1 to 9\n    for b in range(0, 10):  # ones digit from 0 to 9\n        if a > b:\n            count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all possible two-digit numbers and count those where the tens digit is greater than the ones digit. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
