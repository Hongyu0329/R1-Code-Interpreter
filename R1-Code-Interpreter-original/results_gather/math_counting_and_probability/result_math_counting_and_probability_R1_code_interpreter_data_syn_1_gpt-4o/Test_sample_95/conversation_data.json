    "To solve for \\( n \\) in the equation \\( 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot n = 8! \\), we need to first calculate \\( 8! \\) and then divide it by \\( 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 8! \\):**  \n   \\( 8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\):**  \n   \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 3^2 = 9 \\).  \n   Therefore, \\( 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 = 32 \\times 9 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( n \\):**  \n   Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( n \\):  \n   \\( n = \\frac{8!}{2^5 \\cdot 3^2} \\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate 8!\nfactorial_8 = math.factorial(8)\n\n# Calculate 2^5 * 3^2\npower_product = (2**5) * (3**2)\n\n# Calculate n\nn = factorial_8 // power_product\n\nprint(n)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the value of \\( n \\) by first calculating \\( 8! \\), then the product \\( 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\), and finally dividing the factorial by the product. Let's execute this code to find the value of \\( n \\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 140. This means that the value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot n = 8! \\) is 140.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<140>>>"
