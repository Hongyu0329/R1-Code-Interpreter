    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two randomly picked shoes are of the same color and consist of one left shoe and one right shoe.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of ways to pick two shoes from the 22 shoes (11 pairs):\n\n1. Total number of shoes = 22\n2. Total ways to pick 2 shoes from 22 = C(22, 2)\n\nNext, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to pick two shoes of the same color, with one being a left shoe and the other a right shoe.\n\n- For black shoes: There are 6 pairs, so 6 ways to pick one left and one right shoe.\n- For brown shoes: There are 3 pairs, so 3 ways to pick one left and one right shoe.\n- For gray shoes: There are 2 pairs, so 2 ways to pick one left and one right shoe.\n\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the ways for each color.\n\nFinally, the probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of ways to pick two shoes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of shoes\ntotal_shoes = 22\n\n# Total ways to pick 2 shoes from 22\ntotal_ways = math.comb(total_shoes, 2)\n\n# Favorable outcomes\nfavorable_black = 6  # 6 pairs of black shoes\nfavorable_brown = 3  # 3 pairs of brown shoes\nfavorable_gray = 2   # 2 pairs of gray shoes\n\n# Total favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = favorable_black + favorable_brown + favorable_gray\n\n# Probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_ways\n\n# Output the probability as a common fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability_fraction = Fraction(probability).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(probability_fraction)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "The code execution has provided the probability as a common fraction, which is \\( \\frac{1}{21} \\). This means that the probability of picking two shoes of the same color, with one being a left shoe and the other a right shoe, is \\( \\frac{1}{21} \\).\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
