    "To determine how many rows of Pascal's Triangle contain the number 43, we need to understand how Pascal's Triangle is constructed. Each element in Pascal's Triangle is a binomial coefficient, which can be represented as:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the row number (starting from 0) and \\( k \\) is the position in the row (also starting from 0).\n\nWe need to find all pairs of \\( (n, k) \\) such that \\( C(n, k) = 43 \\).\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute the binomial coefficients for different values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) and check when they equal 43. We will iterate over possible values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) to find all such occurrences.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_rows_with_value(value):\n    rows = set()\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        found = False\n        for k in range(n + 1):\n            if math.comb(n, k) == value:\n                rows.add(n)\n                found = True\n        if not found and n > value:\n            break\n        n += 1\n    return rows\n\nrows_with_43 = find_rows_with_value(43)\nprint(len(rows_with_43))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the binomial coefficients for increasing values of \\( n \\) and check if any of them equal 43. If a match is found, the row number \\( n \\) is added to a set to ensure uniqueness. The loop stops when no new matches are found and \\( n \\) exceeds the value we are looking for, as larger \\( n \\) will not yield smaller coefficients. The length of the set gives us the number of unique rows containing the number 43.",
    "The code execution indicates that the number 43 appears in only one row of Pascal's Triangle. This means there is only one unique row \\( n \\) where the binomial coefficient \\( C(n, k) = 43 \\) for some \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
