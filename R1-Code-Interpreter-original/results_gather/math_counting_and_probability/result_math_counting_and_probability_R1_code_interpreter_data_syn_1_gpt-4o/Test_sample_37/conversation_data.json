    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two chips drawn from the bag are of different colors. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of chips in the bag:\n- Blue chips = 5\n- Red chips = 4\n- Yellow chips = 3\n\nTotal chips = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12\n\nSince the chip is replaced after the first draw, the probability of drawing any chip remains the same for both draws.\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of drawing two chips of the same color:\n1. Probability of drawing two blue chips:\n   - Probability of first blue chip = 5/12\n   - Probability of second blue chip = 5/12\n   - Combined probability = (5/12) * (5/12)\n\n2. Probability of drawing two red chips:\n   - Probability of first red chip = 4/12\n   - Probability of second red chip = 4/12\n   - Combined probability = (4/12) * (4/12)\n\n3. Probability of drawing two yellow chips:\n   - Probability of first yellow chip = 3/12\n   - Probability of second yellow chip = 3/12\n   - Combined probability = (3/12) * (3/12)\n\nThe probability of drawing two chips of the same color is the sum of the above probabilities.\n\nFinally, the probability of drawing two chips of different colors is 1 minus the probability of drawing two chips of the same color.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Total number of chips\ntotal_chips = 12\n\n# Probability of drawing two blue chips\nprob_blue_blue = (5/total_chips) * (5/total_chips)\n\n# Probability of drawing two red chips\nprob_red_red = (4/total_chips) * (4/total_chips)\n\n# Probability of drawing two yellow chips\nprob_yellow_yellow = (3/total_chips) * (3/total_chips)\n\n# Probability of drawing two chips of the same color\nprob_same_color = prob_blue_blue + prob_red_red + prob_yellow_yellow\n\n# Probability of drawing two chips of different colors\nprob_different_color = 1 - prob_same_color\n\n# Expressing the probability as a common fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprob_different_color_fraction = Fraction(prob_different_color).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(prob_different_color_fraction)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "The code execution has provided the probability of drawing two chips of different colors as \\( \\frac{47}{72} \\). This fraction represents the probability that the two chips drawn are of different colors when one chip is drawn, replaced, and then another chip is drawn.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<47/72>>>"
