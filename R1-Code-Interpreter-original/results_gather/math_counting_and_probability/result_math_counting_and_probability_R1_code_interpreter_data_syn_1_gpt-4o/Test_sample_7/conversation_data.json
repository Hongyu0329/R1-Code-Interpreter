    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle from the 2 by 2003 grid does not include a shaded square. \n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Shaded Squares:**\n   - The grid is 2 rows by 2003 columns.\n   - The middle unit square of each row is shaded. Since there are 2003 columns, the middle column is the 1002nd column (since 2003/2 = 1001.5, we round up to 1002).\n\n2. **Total Number of Rectangles:**\n   - A rectangle is defined by choosing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n   - There are 3 horizontal lines (top, middle, bottom) and 2004 vertical lines (one at each column boundary).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines from 3 is \\( \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \\).\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines from 2004 is \\( \\binom{2004}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Rectangles Including the Shaded Column:**\n   - For a rectangle to include the shaded column, it must have one vertical line on or before the 1002nd column and one on or after the 1002nd column.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines such that they include the 1002nd column is the total number of ways to choose 2 lines minus the number of ways to choose both lines either before or after the 1002nd column.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability is the number of rectangles not including the shaded column divided by the total number of rectangles.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of rectangles\ntotal_rectangles = comb(3, 2) * comb(2004, 2)\n\n# Rectangles including the shaded column\nrectangles_including_shaded = comb(3, 2) * (comb(1002, 2) + comb(1002, 2))\n\n# Rectangles not including the shaded column\nrectangles_not_including_shaded = total_rectangles - rectangles_including_shaded\n\n# Probability\nprobability = rectangles_not_including_shaded / total_rectangles\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned a probability of approximately 0.5002496255616575. However, we need to express this probability as a common fraction.\n\n### Converting to a Common Fraction:\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.5002496255616575, which suggests that the fraction is very close to 1/2. Let's express this probability as a common fraction by simplifying it.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, the probability should be a simple fraction. Let's verify and simplify it manually:\n\n1. **Total Number of Rectangles:**\n   - Total rectangles = \\( \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{2004}{2} \\)\n\n2. **Rectangles Including the Shaded Column:**\n   - Rectangles including the shaded column = \\( \\binom{3}{2} \\times (1002 \\times 1002) \\)\n\n3. **Rectangles Not Including the Shaded Column:**\n   - Rectangles not including the shaded column = Total rectangles - Rectangles including the shaded column\n\n4. **Probability:**\n   - Probability = Rectangles not including the shaded column / Total rectangles\n\nLet's calculate these values manually to ensure accuracy:\n\n- Total rectangles = \\( 3 \\times \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2} \\)\n- Rectangles including the shaded column = \\( 3 \\times 1002 \\times 1002 \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\n- Probability = \\( \\frac{\\text{Total rectangles} - \\text{Rectangles including the shaded column}}{\\text{Total rectangles}} \\)\n\nLet's simplify this manually:\n\n- Total rectangles = \\( 3 \\times \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2} = 3 \\times 1002 \\times 2003 \\)\n- Rectangles including the shaded column = \\( 3 \\times 1002 \\times 1002 \\)\n\n- Probability = \\( \\frac{3 \\times 1002 \\times 2003 - 3 \\times 1002 \\times 1002}{3 \\times 1002 \\times 2003} \\)\n- Simplifying, Probability = \\( \\frac{1002 \\times (2003 - 1002)}{1002 \\times 2003} \\)\n- Probability = \\( \\frac{1001}{2003} \\)\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does not include a shaded square is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1001}{2003}\\)>>>"
