    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year.\n\nFirst, let's identify the numbers on a six-sided die:\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nNext, we classify these numbers:\n- Composite numbers: 4, 6\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5\n- The number 1 requires a re-roll.\n\nThe probability of rolling each number is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nIf Bob rolls a 1, he rolls again. Therefore, we need to calculate the effective probabilities of rolling a composite or prime number, considering the re-rolls.\n\nLet's calculate the effective probabilities:\n- Probability of rolling a composite number (4 or 6): \\( P(\\text{composite}) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- Probability of rolling a prime number (2, 3, or 5): \\( P(\\text{prime}) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nThe probability of rolling a 1 and re-rolling is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). Since the die is fair, the probabilities of rolling composite or prime numbers remain the same after re-rolling.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected difference in the number of days:\n- Let \\( X \\) be the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal (prime numbers).\n- Let \\( Y \\) be the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal (composite numbers).\n\nThe expected value of \\( X - Y \\) over 365 days is:\n\\[ E(X - Y) = 365 \\times (P(\\text{prime}) - P(\\text{composite})) \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the probabilities\nP_prime = 1/2\nP_composite = 1/3\n\n# Number of days in a non-leap year\ndays_in_year = 365\n\n# Calculate the expected difference\nexpected_difference = days_in_year * (P_prime - P_composite)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(expected_difference)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the expected difference.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the expected difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year. The expected value is approximately 60.83.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<60.83>>>"
