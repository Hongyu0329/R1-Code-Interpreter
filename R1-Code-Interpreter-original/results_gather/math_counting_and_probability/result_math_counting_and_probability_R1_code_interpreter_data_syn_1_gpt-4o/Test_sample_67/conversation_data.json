    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard six-sided dice are rolled. \n\nEach die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. The probability of rolling a 1 on a single die is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). Since we have two dice, we need to consider the expected number of 1's for each die separately and then sum them up.\n\nThe expected value \\( E \\) for a single die to show a 1 is calculated as follows:\n\\[ E(\\text{1 on one die}) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 0 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nSince the dice are independent, the expected number of 1's for two dice is:\n\\[ E(\\text{1's on two dice}) = E(\\text{1 on first die}) + E(\\text{1 on second die}) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nThus, the expected number of 1's obtained when two dice are rolled is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nLet's confirm this calculation using a Python script to simulate the process and compute the expected value.\n\n```python\n# Simulate rolling two dice and calculate the expected number of 1's\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# All possible outcomes for two dice\noutcomes = list(product(range(1, 7), repeat=2))\n\n# Calculate the expected number of 1's\nexpected_ones = sum((die1 == 1) + (die2 == 1) for die1, die2 in outcomes) / len(outcomes)\n\nprint(expected_ones)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the expected number of 1's.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), which is approximately 0.3333 in decimal form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)>>>"
