    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that both members chosen are girls. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of ways to choose 2 members from the 10 members. This can be calculated using combinations:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total ways} = \\binom{10}{2} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from the 5 girls:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ways to choose 2 girls} = \\binom{5}{2} \\]\n\nThe probability that both members chosen are girls is then the ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 girls to the total number of ways to choose 2 members:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\binom{5}{2}}{\\binom{10}{2}} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total ways to choose 2 members from 10\ntotal_ways = math.comb(10, 2)\n\n# Ways to choose 2 girls from 5\nways_to_choose_girls = math.comb(5, 2)\n\n# Probability that both chosen are girls\nprobability = ways_to_choose_girls / total_ways\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the probability that both members chosen are girls. The probability is approximately 0.2222.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.2222>>>"
