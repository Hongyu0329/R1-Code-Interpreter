    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two specific events happening simultaneously:\n\n1. The leftmost lamp is blue and off.\n2. The rightmost lamp is red and on.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Arranging the Lamps:**\n   - Ryan has 3 red and 3 blue lamps, making a total of 6 lamps.\n   - The number of ways to arrange these 6 lamps in a row is given by the combination formula for arranging items with repetitions: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{6!}{3! \\times 3!}\n     \\]\n   - This accounts for the indistinguishable nature of the lamps of the same color.\n\n2. **Turning on the Lamps:**\n   - Out of the 6 lamps, 3 are turned on.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 lamps to turn on from 6 is given by the combination formula:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{3}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - We need the leftmost lamp to be blue and off, and the rightmost lamp to be red and on.\n   - For the leftmost lamp to be blue and off, it must be in the off group, and for the rightmost lamp to be red and on, it must be in the on group.\n   - We need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining lamps such that these conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to find the probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of ways to arrange the lamps\ntotal_arrangements = math.comb(6, 3)\n\n# Total number of ways to choose 3 lamps to turn on\ntotal_turn_on = math.comb(6, 3)\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\n# 1. Leftmost is blue and off\n# 2. Rightmost is red and on\n\n# Fix the leftmost as blue and off, and rightmost as red and on\n# Remaining lamps: 2 red, 2 blue\n# Choose 2 lamps to turn on from the remaining 4 lamps\nfavorable_turn_on = math.comb(4, 2)\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = favorable_turn_on / (total_arrangements * total_turn_on)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "It seems there was an error in the calculation process.
