I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color.  How many choices for outfits do I have?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outfits and then subtract the number of outfits where all three items are the same color.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outfits**: \n   - Since there are 6 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 6 hats, and each item can be chosen independently, the total number of possible outfits is the product of the number of choices for each item:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Outfits} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n     \\]\n\n2. **Outfits with All Items the Same Color**:\n   - There are 6 colors, and for each color, there is exactly one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat. Therefore, there are 6 outfits where all items are the same color.\n\n3. **Valid Outfits**:\n   - The number of valid outfits is the total number of outfits minus the number of outfits where all items are the same color:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Valid Outfits} = 216 - 6 = 210\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Total number of items for each category\nnum_colors = 6\n\n# Total possible outfits\ntotal_outfits = num_colors ** 3\n\n# Outfits with all items the same color\nsame_color_outfits = num_colors\n\n# Valid outfits\nvalid_outfits = total_outfits - same_color_outfits\n\nprint(valid_outfits)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed our manual calculation. Therefore, the number of valid outfit choices, where not all items are the same color, is:\n\n<<<210>>>"
