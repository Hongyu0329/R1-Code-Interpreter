    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from rolling three standard dice is equal to 1. \n\nA standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. When three dice are rolled, the possible outcomes for each die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice is \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\).\n\nFor the product \\(abc\\) to be equal to 1, each of the numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) must be 1, because 1 is the only number on a die that can multiply with itself to give 1. Therefore, the only combination that satisfies \\(abc = 1\\) is when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\n1. The number of favorable outcomes (where \\(abc = 1\\)) is 1, as explained above.\n2. The total number of possible outcomes is 216.\n\nThe probability is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet's calculate this probability using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice\ntotal_outcomes = 6 * 6 * 6\n\n# Number of favorable outcomes where abc = 1\nfavorable_outcomes = 1\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from rolling three dice is equal to 1.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from rolling three standard dice is equal to 1. The probability is approximately 0.00463.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.00463>>>"
