    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of 3-letter words that can be formed from the letters A, B, C, and D, with the condition that the letter A must appear at least once in each word.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Total Number of 3-letter Words Without Restriction:**\n   - Each position in the 3-letter word can be filled by any of the 4 letters (A, B, C, D).\n   - Therefore, the total number of 3-letter words is \\(4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 4^3\\).\n\n2. **Number of 3-letter Words Without the Letter A:**\n   - If the letter A is not used, each position can only be filled by B, C, or D.\n   - Therefore, the total number of 3-letter words without A is \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^3\\).\n\n3. **Number of 3-letter Words With At Least One A:**\n   - To find the number of words with at least one A, we subtract the number of words without A from the total number of words.\n   - This is given by: \\(4^3 - 3^3\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of 3-letter words\ntotal_words = 4**3\n\n# Number of 3-letter words without the letter A\nwords_without_A = 3**3\n\n# Number of 3-letter words with at least one A\nwords_with_A = total_words - words_without_A\n\nprint(words_with_A)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result. Based on the calculation, the number of 3-letter words that can be formed from the letters A, B, C, and D, with the condition that the letter A must appear at least once, is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
