    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times when rolling a fair six-sided die four times. This is a classic example of a binomial probability problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Parameters:**\n   - Number of trials (n): 4 (since the die is rolled four times)\n   - Number of successes (k): 3 (since we want to roll the number 1 exactly three times)\n   - Probability of success on a single trial (p): 1/6 (since there is one '1' on a six-sided die)\n\n2. **Binomial Probability Formula:**\n   The probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n   \\[\n   P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   We will use the above formula to calculate the probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Parameters\nn = 4  # number of trials\nk = 3  # number of successes\np = 1/6  # probability of success on a single trial\n\n# Binomial coefficient\nbinom_coeff = math.comb(n, k)\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = binom_coeff * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(n-k))\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times when rolling a six-sided die four times. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the probability of rolling the number 1 exactly three times when rolling a six-sided die four times.\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.0154.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0154>>>"
