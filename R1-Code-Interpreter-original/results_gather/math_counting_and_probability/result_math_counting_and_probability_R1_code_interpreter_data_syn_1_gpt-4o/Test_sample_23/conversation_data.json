    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many unique four-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9. \n\nThe key here is to account for the repetition of digits. If all digits were unique, the number of permutations would be calculated as the factorial of the number of digits, which is 4! (4 factorial). However, since we have repetitions, we need to adjust this calculation.\n\nThe formula for permutations of a multiset (where some elements are repeated) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\ldots \\times n_k!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of the repeated items.\n\nIn this case:\n- Total digits, \\( n = 4 \\)\n- The digit 2 is repeated twice, so \\( n_1 = 2 \\)\n- The digit 9 is repeated twice, so \\( n_2 = 2 \\)\n\nThus, the number of unique permutations is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of digits\nn = 4\n\n# Frequencies of repeated digits\nn1 = 2\nn2 = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of unique permutations\nunique_permutations = math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(n1) * math.factorial(n2))\n\nprint(unique_permutations)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the number of unique four-digit integers that can be formed.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the number of unique permutations of the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9. The result is 6, which means there are 6 different positive four-digit integers that can be formed using these digits.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
