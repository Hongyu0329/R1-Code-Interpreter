    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways Michael can choose 3 out of 8 math classes, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter, which is the case here.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[ C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from,\n- \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose,\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this problem, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\). We can calculate the number of combinations using this formula.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of classes\nn = 8\n# Number of classes to choose\nr = 3\n\n# Calculate combinations\ncombinations = math.comb(n, r)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(combinations)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of ways Michael can choose 3 classes out of 8 and print the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the result of 56. This means there are 56 different ways for Michael to choose 3 out of 8 math classes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<56>>>"
