    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of different sandwiches Alex can make by choosing one kind of meat and two kinds of cheese. \n\n1. **Choosing the Meat**: Alex has 10 different kinds of lunch meat. So, there are 10 ways to choose the meat.\n\n2. **Choosing the Cheese**: Alex has 9 different kinds of cheese, and he needs to choose 2 different kinds. The order in which he chooses the cheese does not matter, so this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 cheeses from 9 is given by the combination formula:\n\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n   In this case, \\( n = 9 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Number of Sandwiches**: The total number of different sandwiches is the product of the number of ways to choose the meat and the number of ways to choose the cheese.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of ways to choose 1 meat from 10\nways_to_choose_meat = 10\n\n# Number of ways to choose 2 cheeses from 9\nways_to_choose_cheese = math.comb(9, 2)\n\n# Total number of different sandwiches\ntotal_sandwiches = ways_to_choose_meat * ways_to_choose_cheese\n\nprint(total_sandwiches)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the total number of different sandwiches Alex can make.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the total number of different sandwiches Alex can make. The output is 360, which means there are 360 different combinations of sandwiches that Alex can create by choosing one kind of meat and two kinds of cheese.\n\n<<<360>>>"
