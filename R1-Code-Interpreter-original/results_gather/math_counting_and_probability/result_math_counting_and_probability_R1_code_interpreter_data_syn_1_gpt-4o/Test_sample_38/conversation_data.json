    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of Pascal's Triangle and how to calculate the probability of selecting a '1' from the first 15 rows.\n\n### Pascal's Triangle Structure:\n- Each row \\( n \\) in Pascal's Triangle has \\( n+1 \\) elements.\n- The elements in row \\( n \\) are given by the binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\).\n- The first and last elements of each row are always 1, i.e., \\(\\binom{n}{0} = 1\\) and \\(\\binom{n}{n} = 1\\).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Count the Total Number of Elements:**\n   - The total number of elements in the first 15 rows (rows 0 through 14) is the sum of the first 15 natural numbers: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 15\\).\n\n2. **Count the Number of '1's:**\n   - Each row contributes exactly two '1's (at the start and end), except for row 0, which contributes only one '1'.\n   - Therefore, the number of '1's is \\(2 \\times 14 + 1\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability is the ratio of the number of '1's to the total number of elements.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of elements in the first 15 rows\ntotal_elements = sum(range(1, 16))\n\n# Calculate the number of '1's in the first 15 rows\nnumber_of_ones = 2 * 14 + 1\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = number_of_ones / total_elements\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the probability of selecting a '1' from the first 15 rows of Pascal's Triangle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability of selecting a '1' from the first 15 rows of Pascal's Triangle. \n\nThe probability is approximately 0.2417.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.2417>>>"
