  "question": "The Screamers are coached by Coach Yellsalot.  The Screamers have 12 players, but two of them, Bob and Yogi, refuse to play together.  How many starting lineups (of 5 players) can Coach Yellsalot make, if the starting lineup can't contain both Bob and Yogi?  (The order of the 5 players in the lineup does not matter; that is, two lineups are the same if they consist of the same 5 players.)\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: ",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible starting lineups of 5 players from a team of 12 players, with the restriction that Bob and Yogi cannot both be in the lineup.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Total Combinations Without Restriction**: First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 players out of 12 without any restrictions. This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of players, and k is the number of players to choose.\n\n2. **Combinations Including Both Bob and Yogi**: Next, calculate the number of lineups that include both Bob and Yogi. If both are in the lineup, we need to choose 3 more players from the remaining 10 players (since Bob and Yogi are already chosen).\n\n3. **Valid Combinations**: Subtract the number of lineups that include both Bob and Yogi from the total number of lineups to get the number of valid lineups.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of players\ntotal_players = 12\n\n# Number of players in a lineup\nlineup_size = 5\n\n# Calculate total combinations without restriction\ntotal_combinations = math.comb(total_players, lineup_size)\n\n# Calculate combinations including both Bob and Yogi\n# If Bob and Yogi are in the lineup, we choose 3 more players from the remaining 10\ncombinations_with_both = math.comb(total_players - 2, lineup_size - 2)\n\n# Valid combinations (total - those with both Bob and Yogi)\nvalid_combinations = total_combinations - combinations_with_both\n\nprint(valid_combinations)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of valid starting lineups that Coach Yellsalot can make, considering the restriction that Bob and Yogi cannot both be in the lineup. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the number of valid starting lineups. Based on the calculations, the number of starting lineups that Coach Yellsalot can make, without including both Bob and Yogi, is 672.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<672>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The Screamers are coached by Coach Yellsalot.
