Paul and Yuri want it to be sunny one of those days for a World War III preenactment, but if it's sunny for more than one day they won't know what to do with themselves.

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that it is sunny exactly one day out of the four-day weekend. \n\nGiven:\n- Probability of rain on any given day = 75% = 0.75\n- Probability of sunny on any given day = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n\nWe need to find the probability of exactly one sunny day in four days. This is a binomial probability problem where:\n- n = 4 (number of trials, i.e., days)\n- k = 1 (number of successful trials, i.e., sunny days)\n- p = 0.25 (probability of success on a single trial, i.e., sunny day)\n\nThe probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this probability using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Given values\nn = 4  # number of days\nk = 1  # number of sunny days\np = 0.25  # probability of a sunny day\n\n# Calculate the probability using the binomial formula\nprobability = comb(n, k) * (p ** k) * ((1 - p) ** (n - k))\n\n# Convert the probability to a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability_fraction = Fraction(probability).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(probability_fraction)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of having exactly one sunny day in four days and express it as a fraction.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the probability as a fraction. The probability that Paul and Yuri get exactly one sunny day during the four-day weekend is \\(\\frac{27}{64}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<27/64>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The Boston weatherman says there is a 75 percent chance of rain for each day of the Labor Day four-day weekend.
