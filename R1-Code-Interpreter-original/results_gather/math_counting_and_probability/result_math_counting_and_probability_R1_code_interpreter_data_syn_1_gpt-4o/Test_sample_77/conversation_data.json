    "To determine how many three-digit numbers there are, we need to consider the range of numbers that qualify as three-digit numbers. A three-digit number starts from 100 and goes up to 999.\n\nThe reasoning process involves calculating the total number of integers from 100 to 999, inclusive. This can be done by subtracting the smallest three-digit number from the largest three-digit number and then adding one to include both endpoints.\n\nLet's calculate this using a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Define the smallest and largest three-digit numbers\nsmallest_three_digit = 100\nlargest_three_digit = 999\n\n# Calculate the number of three-digit numbers\nnumber_of_three_digit_numbers = largest_three_digit - smallest_three_digit + 1\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_three_digit_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output of 900. This means there are 900 three-digit numbers, starting from 100 and ending at 999.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<900>>>"
