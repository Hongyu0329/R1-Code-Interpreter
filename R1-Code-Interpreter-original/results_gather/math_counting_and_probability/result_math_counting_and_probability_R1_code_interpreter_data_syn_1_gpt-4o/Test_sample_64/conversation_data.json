    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of getting at most one tail when flipping $n$ coins. \n\nThe probability of getting a tail on a single coin flip is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of getting a head is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nThe probability of getting at most one tail in $n$ flips is the sum of the probabilities of getting exactly 0 tails and exactly 1 tail.\n\n1. **Probability of getting 0 tails (all heads):** \n   This is simply the probability of getting heads on all $n$ flips, which is $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$.\n\n2. **Probability of getting exactly 1 tail:**\n   We can choose which one of the $n$ coins will show tails in $\\binom{n}{1} = n$ ways. The probability of getting tails on one specific coin and heads on the rest is $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 1 tail is $n \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^n$.\n\nThe total probability of getting at most one tail is the sum of these two probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at most 1 tail}) = (\\frac{1}{2})^n + n \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^n\n\\]\n\nGiven that this probability is $\\frac{3}{16}$, we have:\n\n\\[\n(\\frac{1}{2})^n + n \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^n = \\frac{3}{16}\n\\]\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n\\[\n(1 + n) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^n = \\frac{3}{16}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for $n$ using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nn = symbols('n', integer=True, positive=True)\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq((1 + n) * (1/2)**n, 3/16)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of $n$ that satisfies the equation.",
    "The code output indicates that the solution to the equation is \\( n = 5 \\). This means that when 5 coins are flipped, the probability of getting at most one tail is \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of coins \\( n \\) is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
