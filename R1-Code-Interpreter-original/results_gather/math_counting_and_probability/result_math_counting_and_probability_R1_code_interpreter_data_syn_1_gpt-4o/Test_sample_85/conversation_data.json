    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events happening in sequence: drawing a red marble first and then drawing a white marble second, without replacement.\n\n1. **Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first:**\n   - There are 3 red marbles out of a total of 8 marbles (3 red + 5 white).\n   - Probability of drawing a red marble first = Number of red marbles / Total number of marbles = 3/8.\n\n2. **Calculate the probability of drawing a white marble second:**\n   - After drawing a red marble, there are now 7 marbles left in the bag (2 red + 5 white).\n   - Probability of drawing a white marble second = Number of white marbles / Total number of remaining marbles = 5/7.\n\n3. **Calculate the combined probability:**\n   - Since these are independent events, the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of red and white marbles\nred_marbles = 3\nwhite_marbles = 5\n\n# Total number of marbles\ntotal_marbles = red_marbles + white_marbles\n\n# Probability of drawing a red marble first\nprob_red_first = red_marbles / total_marbles\n\n# Probability of drawing a white marble second\n# After drawing a red marble, one less marble in total and one less red marble\nprob_white_second = white_marbles / (total_marbles - 1)\n\n# Combined probability\ncombined_probability = prob_red_first * prob_white_second\n\nprint(combined_probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first and a white marble second. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability of drawing a red marble first and a white marble second. The result is approximately 0.26785714285714285.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white is:\n\n<<<0.26785714285714285>>>"
