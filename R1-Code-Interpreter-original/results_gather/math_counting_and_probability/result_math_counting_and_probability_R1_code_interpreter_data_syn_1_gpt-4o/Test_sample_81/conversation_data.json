    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a green ball from the randomly chosen container. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Probability of Selecting a Container:**\n   - There are three containers: A, B, and C.\n   - The probability of selecting any one container is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of Selecting a Green Ball from Each Container:**\n   - **Container A:** \n     - Total balls = 4 red + 6 green = 10 balls.\n     - Probability of selecting a green ball = \\( \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n   - **Container B:** \n     - Total balls = 6 red + 4 green = 10 balls.\n     - Probability of selecting a green ball = \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n   - **Container C:** \n     - Total balls = 6 red + 4 green = 10 balls.\n     - Probability of selecting a green ball = \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n3. **Total Probability of Selecting a Green Ball:**\n   - We use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of selecting a green ball:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Green}) = P(\\text{A}) \\cdot P(\\text{Green}|\\text{A}) + P(\\text{B}) \\cdot P(\\text{Green}|\\text{B}) + P(\\text{C}) \\cdot P(\\text{Green}|\\text{C})\n   \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Probabilities of selecting a green ball from each container\np_green_A = 3/5\np_green_B = 2/5\np_green_C = 2/5\n\n# Probability of selecting each container\np_container = 1/3\n\n# Total probability of selecting a green ball\np_green = p_container * p_green_A + p_container * p_green_B + p_container * p_green_C\n\n# Output the result\nprint(p_green)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the probability of selecting a green ball.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability of selecting a green ball. The result is a decimal, but we need to express the probability as a common fraction.\n\nThe decimal 0.4666666666666667 is equivalent to the fraction \\(\\frac{14}{30}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a green ball is \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\n<<<7/15>>>"
