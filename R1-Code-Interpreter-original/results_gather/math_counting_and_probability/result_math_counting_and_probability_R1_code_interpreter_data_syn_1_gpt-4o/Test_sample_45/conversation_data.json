    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{ 2, 4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 50 \\}\\) is a multiple of 100.\n\nFirst, let's consider the conditions for a product to be a multiple of 100. A number is a multiple of 100 if it has at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5 (since \\(100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2\\)).\n\nLet's analyze the factors of 2 and 5 in each number in the set:\n\n- \\(2 = 2^1 \\times 5^0\\)\n- \\(4 = 2^2 \\times 5^0\\)\n- \\(10 = 2^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 5^0\\)\n- \\(15 = 2^0 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(50 = 2^1 \\times 5^2\\)\n\nTo have a product that is a multiple of 100, the product of two numbers must have at least \\(2^2\\) and \\(5^2\\).\n\nNext, we will calculate the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set and then count the number of favorable outcomes where the product is a multiple of 100.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of elements in the set, and \\(k\\) is the number of elements to choose. Here, \\(n = 7\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of favorable outcomes. We will check each pair of numbers to see if their product is a multiple of 100.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the set\nnumbers = [2, 4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 50]\n\n# Function to check if a product is a multiple of 100\ndef is_multiple_of_100(a, b):\n    product = a * b\n    return product % 100 == 0\n\n# Calculate total number of combinations\ntotal_combinations = len(list(combinations(numbers, 2)))\n\n# Calculate number of favorable combinations\nfavorable_combinations = sum(1 for a, b in combinations(numbers, 2) if is_multiple_of_100(a, b))\n\n# Calculate probability\nprobability = favorable_combinations / total_combinations\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the probability by counting the number of favorable combinations and dividing by the total number of combinations. Let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set is a multiple of 100. The result is approximately \\(0.3333\\), which can be expressed as a common fraction.\n\nThe decimal \\(0.3333\\) is equivalent to the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set is a multiple of 100 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
