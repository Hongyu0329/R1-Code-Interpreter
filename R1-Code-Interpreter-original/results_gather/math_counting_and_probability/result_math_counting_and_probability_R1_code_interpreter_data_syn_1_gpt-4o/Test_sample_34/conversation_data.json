    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a green ball from the randomly chosen container. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Probability of Selecting Each Container:**\n   - There are three containers, and each is equally likely to be chosen. Therefore, the probability of selecting any one container is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Probability of Selecting a Green Ball from Each Container:**\n   - **Container I:** It has 8 red balls and 4 green balls. The probability of selecting a green ball from Container I is \\( \\frac{4}{8+4} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n   - **Container II:** It has 2 red balls and 4 green balls. The probability of selecting a green ball from Container II is \\( \\frac{4}{2+4} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n   - **Container III:** It has 2 red balls and 4 green balls. The probability of selecting a green ball from Container III is \\( \\frac{4}{2+4} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Total Probability of Selecting a Green Ball:**\n   - We use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of selecting a green ball:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Green}) = P(\\text{Green} | \\text{Container I}) \\cdot P(\\text{Container I}) + P(\\text{Green} | \\text{Container II}) \\cdot P(\\text{Container II}) + P(\\text{Green} | \\text{Container III}) \\cdot P(\\text{Container III})\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Probabilities of selecting each container\np_container = 1/3\n\n# Probabilities of selecting a green ball from each container\np_green_I = 4/12\np_green_II = 4/6\np_green_III = 4/6\n\n# Total probability of selecting a green ball\np_green = (p_green_I * p_container) + (p_green_II * p_container) + (p_green_III * p_container)\n\nprint(p_green)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of selecting a green ball, which is approximately 0.5555555555555556. To express this as a common fraction, we recognize that this decimal is equivalent to \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a green ball is:\n\n<<<5/9>>>"
