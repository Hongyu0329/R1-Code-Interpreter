    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly selected ball from the 50 balls is numbered with a multiple of 5 or 7 or both.\n\n1. **Identify Multiples of 5 and 7:**\n   - First, we find the multiples of 5 within the range 1 to 50.\n   - Then, we find the multiples of 7 within the same range.\n   - Finally, we find the multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35) within the range.\n\n2. **Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:**\n   - The probability of selecting a ball with a number that is a multiple of 5 or 7 is given by:\n     \\[\n     P(5 \\cup 7) = P(5) + P(7) - P(5 \\cap 7)\n     \\]\n   - Where:\n     - \\(P(5)\\) is the probability of selecting a multiple of 5.\n     - \\(P(7)\\) is the probability of selecting a multiple of 7.\n     - \\(P(5 \\cap 7)\\) is the probability of selecting a multiple of both 5 and 7.\n\n3. **Calculate the Probabilities:**\n   - Count the number of multiples of 5, 7, and 35 within the range.\n   - Use these counts to calculate the probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of balls\ntotal_balls = 50\n\n# Count multiples of 5\nmultiples_of_5 = len([i for i in range(1, total_balls + 1) if i % 5 == 0])\n\n# Count multiples of 7\nmultiples_of_7 = len([i for i in range(1, total_balls + 1) if i % 7 == 0])\n\n# Count multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35)\nmultiples_of_35 = len([i for i in range(1, total_balls + 1) if i % 35 == 0])\n\n# Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nprobability = (multiples_of_5 + multiples_of_7 - multiples_of_35) / total_balls\n\n# Print the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprint(Fraction(probability).limit_denominator())\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability and express it as a common fraction. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the probability that a randomly selected ball is numbered with a multiple of 5 or 7 or both. The result is expressed as a common fraction.\n\nThe probability is \\(\\frac{8}{25}\\).\n\n<<<8/25>>>"
