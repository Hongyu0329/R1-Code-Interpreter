    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 3-digit numbers have the property that their middle digit is larger than the other two digits. Let's denote a 3-digit number as \\(abc\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are its digits. The conditions for \\(abc\\) to be a mountain number are:\n\n1. \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are digits, so \\(0 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 9\\).\n2. \\(a\\) cannot be 0 because \\(abc\\) is a 3-digit number, so \\(1 \\leq a \\leq 9\\).\n3. The middle digit \\(b\\) must be greater than both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\), i.e., \\(b > a\\) and \\(b > c\\).\n\nTo find the total number of such numbers, we can iterate over all possible values of \\(b\\) and count the valid combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) for each \\(b\\).\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nfor b in range(1, 10):  # b must be between 1 and 9\n    for a in range(0, b):  # a must be less than b\n        for c in range(0, b):  # c must be less than b\n            if a != 0:  # a must be non-zero for a 3-digit number\n                count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code will count all the valid 3-digit mountain numbers by iterating over possible values of \\(b\\) and checking the conditions for \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the count of 3-digit mountain numbers. Based on the logic and the code execution, the total number of 3-digit mountain numbers is 240.\n\n<<<240>>>"
