    "To find \\(\\binom{18}{12}\\), we can use Pascal's identity, which states:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}\n\\]\n\nApplying this identity to \\(\\binom{18}{12}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{18}{12} = \\binom{17}{11} + \\binom{17}{12}\n\\]\n\nWe are given \\(\\binom{17}{11} = 12376\\). However, we do not have \\(\\binom{17}{12}\\) directly. We can use the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, which states:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(\\binom{17}{12} = \\binom{17}{5}\\).\n\nTo find \\(\\binom{17}{5}\\), we can use the fact that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{17}{5} = \\binom{17}{12} = \\frac{\\binom{19}{12} \\times 12}{19 - 12 + 1}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(\\binom{19}{12} = 50388\\), we can calculate \\(\\binom{17}{5}\\) and then find \\(\\binom{18}{12}\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbinom_19_12 = 50388\nbinom_17_11 = 12376\n\n# Calculate binom(17, 5) using the relation with binom(19, 12)\nbinom_17_5 = binom_19_12 * 12 // (19 - 12 + 1)\n\n# Calculate binom(18, 12) using Pascal's identity\nbinom_18_12 = binom_17_11 + binom_17_5\n\nprint(binom_18_12)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\(\\binom{18}{12}\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 87958. This means that the value of \\(\\binom{18}{12}\\) is 87958.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<87958>>>"
