    "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \\(\\left(\\sqrt{4! \\cdot 3!}\\right)^2\\).\n\n1. **Calculate the factorials**:\n   - \\(4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\)\n   - \\(3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the factorials**:\n   - \\(4! \\cdot 3! = 24 \\cdot 6\\)\n\n3. **Take the square root and then square it**:\n   - \\(\\left(\\sqrt{4! \\cdot 3!}\\right)^2 = 4! \\cdot 3!\\)\n\nSince squaring the square root of a number returns the original number, the expression simplifies to \\(4! \\cdot 3!\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate factorials\nfactorial_4 = math.factorial(4)\nfactorial_3 = math.factorial(3)\n\n# Calculate the product\nproduct = factorial_4 * factorial_3\n\n# Since the expression simplifies to the product itself, print the product\nprint(product)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final answer.",
    "The code execution confirms that the value of \\(\\left(\\sqrt{4! \\cdot 3!}\\right)^2\\) is indeed the product of \\(4!\\) and \\(3!\\), which is 144.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<144>>>"
