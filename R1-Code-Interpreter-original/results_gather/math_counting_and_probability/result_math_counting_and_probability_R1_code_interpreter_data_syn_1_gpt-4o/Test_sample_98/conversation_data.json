    "To solve the problem \\( \\frac{9!}{8!} \\), we can simplify the expression by recognizing that factorials are products of consecutive integers. Specifically, \\( 9! = 9 \\times 8! \\). Therefore, the expression simplifies as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9!}{8!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8!}{8!}\n\\]\n\nThe \\( 8! \\) in the numerator and the denominator cancel each other out, leaving us with:\n\n\\[\n9\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( \\frac{9!}{8!} \\) is simply 9.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate 9! and 8!\nfactorial_9 = math.factorial(9)\nfactorial_8 = math.factorial(8)\n\n# Calculate the division\nresult = factorial_9 / factorial_8\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should see that the result is indeed 9.\n\n<<<9>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The result of \\( \\frac{9!}{8!} \\) is indeed 9. The output is shown as 9.0 because the division operation in Python returns a float by default. However, the integer value is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
