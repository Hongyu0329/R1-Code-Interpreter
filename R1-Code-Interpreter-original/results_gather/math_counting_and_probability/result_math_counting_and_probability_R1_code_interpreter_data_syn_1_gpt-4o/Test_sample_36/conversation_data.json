    "To solve the problem of determining how many ways there are to put 5 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations.\n\nSince both the balls and the boxes are distinguishable, each ball has 2 choices: it can either go into the first box or the second box. Therefore, for each of the 5 balls, there are 2 choices.\n\nThe total number of ways to distribute the balls into the boxes is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each ball. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total ways} = 2^5 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Number of balls\nn_balls = 5\n\n# Number of boxes\nn_boxes = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of ways\ntotal_ways = n_boxes ** n_balls\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_ways)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the total number of ways to distribute the balls into the boxes.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the correct output. The calculation \\(2^5\\) gives us the total number of ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<32>>>"
