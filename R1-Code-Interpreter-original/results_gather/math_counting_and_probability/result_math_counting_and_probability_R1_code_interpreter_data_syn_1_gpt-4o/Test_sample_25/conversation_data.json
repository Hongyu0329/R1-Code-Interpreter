    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the lengths of segments \\(AD\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(CD\\) based on the given conditions, and then calculate the probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Given Conditions:**\n   - \\(AB = 3AD = 6BC\\)\n\n2. **Expressing Lengths in Terms of \\(AB\\):**\n   - Let \\(AB = x\\).\n   - Then, \\(AD = \\frac{x}{3}\\) because \\(AB = 3AD\\).\n   - Also, \\(BC = \\frac{x}{6}\\) because \\(AB = 6BC\\).\n\n3. **Finding \\(CD\\):**\n   - Since \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are on \\(\\overline{AB}\\), we need to find the position of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).\n   - \\(D\\) is at \\(\\frac{x}{3}\\) from \\(A\\).\n   - \\(B\\) is at \\(x\\) from \\(A\\).\n   - \\(C\\) is at \\(x - \\frac{x}{6} = \\frac{5x}{6}\\) from \\(A\\).\n\n4. **Length of \\(CD\\):**\n   - \\(CD = C - D = \\frac{5x}{6} - \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{5x}{6} - \\frac{2x}{6} = \\frac{3x}{6} = \\frac{x}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The probability that a point is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is the length of \\(\\overline{CD}\\) divided by the length of \\(\\overline{AB}\\).\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{CD}{AB} = \\frac{\\frac{x}{2}}{x} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected point on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{1}{2}>>>"
