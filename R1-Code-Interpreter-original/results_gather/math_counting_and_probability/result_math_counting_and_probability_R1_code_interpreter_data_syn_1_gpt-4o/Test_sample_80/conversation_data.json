    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing two red marbles from the jar without replacement.\n\n1. **Total Marbles in the Jar**: \n   - Red marbles = 2\n   - Green marbles = 3\n   - White marbles = 10\n   - Total marbles = 2 + 3 + 10 = 15\n\n2. **Probability of Drawing Two Red Marbles**:\n   - The probability of drawing the first red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles: \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\).\n   - After drawing one red marble, there is one red marble left and a total of 14 marbles left in the jar.\n   - The probability of drawing the second red marble is then \\( \\frac{1}{14} \\).\n\n3. **Combined Probability**:\n   - Since these are independent events (drawing without replacement), we multiply the probabilities of each event: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability of two red marbles} = \\frac{2}{15} \\times \\frac{1}{14}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the probability of drawing two red marbles\nprobability_first_red = 2 / 15\nprobability_second_red = 1 / 14\n\n# Combined probability\ncombined_probability = probability_first_red * probability_second_red\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nresult = Fraction(combined_probability).limit_denominator()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the probability as a common fraction.",
    "The code execution has provided the probability of drawing two red marbles as \\( \\frac{1}{105} \\). This result is consistent with our calculations.\n\nThe probability of drawing two red marbles from the jar without replacement is \\( \\frac{1}{105} \\).\n\n<<<1/105>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A jar contains two red marbles, three green marbles, ten white marbles and no other marbles.
