    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unit squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) ring around a central square. \n\nThe pattern of the number of squares in each ring can be observed as follows:\n- The \\(1^{st}\\) ring has 8 squares.\n- The \\(2^{nd}\\) ring has 16 squares.\n\nWe can see that each ring forms a square border around the previous squares. The number of squares in each ring increases by a constant amount as we move outward. Specifically, the number of squares in the \\(n^{th}\\) ring is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of squares in the } n^{th} \\text{ ring} = 8n \\]\n\nThis formula arises because each ring is essentially a square with a perimeter that increases linearly with \\(n\\). \n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) ring using this formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of squares in the } 100^{th} \\text{ ring} = 8 \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of squares in the 100th ring\nn = 100\nnumber_of_squares = 8 * n\nprint(number_of_squares)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of unit squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) ring.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the number of unit squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) ring. Based on the formula and the computation, the number of unit squares in the \\(100^{th}\\) ring is 800.\n\n<<<800>>>"
