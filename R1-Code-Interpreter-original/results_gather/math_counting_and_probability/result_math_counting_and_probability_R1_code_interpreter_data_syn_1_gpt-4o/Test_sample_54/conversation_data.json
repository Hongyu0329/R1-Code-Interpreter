    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the nature of a fair coin flip. A fair coin has two sides: heads (H) and tails (T), each with an equal probability of occurring. The probability of flipping a head or a tail on any single flip is independent of previous flips. This is a fundamental property of independent events in probability.\n\nGiven that the coin is fair, the probability of flipping a tail on any single flip is 1/2, regardless of the outcomes of previous flips. The fact that Molly flipped heads five times in a row does not affect the probability of the next flip. This is because each flip is an independent event.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Molly will flip a tail on her next flip is simply the probability of flipping a tail on any single flip of a fair coin, which is 1/2.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our understanding is correct.\n\n```python\n# Probability of flipping a tail on a fair coin\nprobability_of_tail = 1 / 2\nprint(probability_of_tail)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning. The probability of flipping a tail on the next flip of a fair coin is 0.5, which can be expressed as the common fraction 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Molly will flip a tail on her next flip is:\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
