    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' and do not contain a '5'. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Total number of three-digit integers**: \n   - The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. \n   - Therefore, there are \\(999 - 100 + 1 = 900\\) three-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Three-digit numbers that do not contain a '5'**:\n   - For the hundreds place, the digits can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (8 options, excluding 5).\n   - For the tens and units places, the digits can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (9 options each, excluding 5).\n   - Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers without a '5' is \\(8 \\times 9 \\times 9\\).\n\n3. **Three-digit numbers that do not contain a '5' and do not contain a '3'**:\n   - For the hundreds place, the digits can be 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (7 options, excluding 3 and 5).\n   - For the tens and units places, the digits can be 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (8 options each, excluding 3 and 5).\n   - Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers without a '5' and without a '3' is \\(7 \\times 8 \\times 8\\).\n\n4. **Three-digit numbers that contain at least one '3' and do not contain a '5'**:\n   - This is the difference between the total number of three-digit numbers without a '5' and those without both '5' and '3'.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Total number of three-digit numbers without a '5'\ntotal_without_5 = 8 * 9 * 9\n\n# Total number of three-digit numbers without a '5' and without a '3'\ntotal_without_5_and_3 = 7 * 8 * 8\n\n# Total number of three-digit numbers with at least one '3' and no '5'\nresult = total_without_5 - total_without_5_and_3\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result. Based on the calculations, the number of positive three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' as a digit but do not contain a '5' as a digit is 200.\n\n<<<200>>>"
