    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the area of triangle \\( PBC \\) is less than half of the area of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of Triangle \\( ABC \\)\n\nTriangle \\( ABC \\) is a right triangle with \\( A = (0, 5) \\), \\( B = (8, 0) \\), and \\( C = (0, 0) \\). The area of a right triangle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nHere, the base \\( BC = 8 \\) and the height \\( AC = 5 \\). Therefore, the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 5 = 20\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Condition for Triangle \\( PBC \\)\n\nWe want the area of triangle \\( PBC \\) to be less than half of the area of triangle \\( ABC \\). Therefore, we need:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle PBC < \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express the Area of Triangle \\( PBC \\)\n\nThe area of triangle \\( PBC \\) can be expressed using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nFor triangle \\( PBC \\), the vertices are \\( P = (x, y) \\), \\( B = (8, 0) \\), and \\( C = (0, 0) \\). Thus, the area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle PBC = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x(0-0) + 8(0-y) + 0(y-0) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8y = 4y\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Set the Inequality\n\nWe need:\n\n\\[\n4y < 10 \\implies y < 2.5\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Probability\n\nThe point \\( P \\) is randomly placed in the interior of triangle \\( ABC \\). The range for \\( y \\) is from 0 to 5 (the height of the triangle). The probability that \\( y < 2.5 \\) is the ratio of the length of the interval where \\( y \\) satisfies the condition to the total length of the interval:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{2.5 - 0}{5 - 0} = \\frac{2.5}{5} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the area of triangle \\( PBC \\) is less than half of the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{1}{2}>>>"
