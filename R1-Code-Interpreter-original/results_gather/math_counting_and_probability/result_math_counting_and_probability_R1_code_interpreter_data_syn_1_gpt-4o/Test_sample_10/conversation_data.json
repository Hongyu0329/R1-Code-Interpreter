    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two balls drawn from the bag are of the same color. Since the balls are replaced after each draw, the probability of drawing a ball of a certain color remains constant for each draw.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Total number of balls**: There are 6 green balls and 4 red balls, making a total of 10 balls.\n\n2. **Probability of drawing two green balls**:\n   - Probability of drawing a green ball on the first draw = 6/10.\n   - Since the ball is replaced, the probability of drawing a green ball on the second draw is also 6/10.\n   - Therefore, the probability of both balls being green = (6/10) * (6/10).\n\n3. **Probability of drawing two red balls**:\n   - Probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw = 4/10.\n   - Since the ball is replaced, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is also 4/10.\n   - Therefore, the probability of both balls being red = (4/10) * (4/10).\n\n4. **Total probability of drawing two balls of the same color**:\n   - This is the sum of the probabilities of both balls being green and both balls being red.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Number of green and red balls\ngreen_balls = 6\nred_balls = 4\ntotal_balls = green_balls + red_balls\n\n# Probability of drawing two green balls\nprob_two_green = (green_balls / total_balls) * (green_balls / total_balls)\n\n# Probability of drawing two red balls\nprob_two_red = (red_balls / total_balls) * (red_balls / total_balls)\n\n# Total probability of drawing two balls of the same color\nprob_same_color = prob_two_green + prob_two_red\n\nprint(prob_same_color)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the probability that the two balls drawn are of the same color is 0.52.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.52>>>"
