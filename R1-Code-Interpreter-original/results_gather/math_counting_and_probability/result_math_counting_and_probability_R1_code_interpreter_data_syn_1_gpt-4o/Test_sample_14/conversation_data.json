    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{ 3, 7, 21, 27, 35, 42, 51 \\}\\) is a multiple of 63.\n\nFirst, let's factor 63:\n\\[ 63 = 3^2 \\times 7 \\]\n\nFor a product to be a multiple of 63, it must include at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 7.\n\nLet's analyze the set:\n- Numbers divisible by 3: \\(3, 21, 27, 42, 51\\)\n- Numbers divisible by 7: \\(7, 21, 35, 42\\)\n\nNow, let's identify the numbers that have at least two factors of 3:\n- \\(27 = 3^3\\)\n- \\(21 = 3 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(51 = 3 \\times 17\\)\n\nNext, let's identify the numbers that have at least one factor of 7:\n- \\(7 = 7\\)\n- \\(21 = 3 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(35 = 5 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\)\n\nNow, let's find pairs of numbers such that their product is a multiple of 63. We need at least one number with two factors of 3 and one number with a factor of 7.\n\nPossible pairs:\n1. \\( (27, 7) \\)\n2. \\( (27, 21) \\)\n3. \\( (27, 35) \\)\n4. \\( (27, 42) \\)\n5. \\( (21, 42) \\)\n6. \\( (42, 51) \\)\n\nLet's calculate the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from the set:\n\\[ \\text{Total pairs} = \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\]\n\nNow, let's count the number of successful pairs that result in a product that is a multiple of 63. We will use the pairs identified above.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of successful pairs\nsuccessful_pairs = [\n    (27, 7), (27, 21), (27, 35), (27, 42), (21, 42), (42, 51)\n]\n\n# Total number of pairs\ntotal_pairs = 21\n\n# Number of successful pairs\nnum_successful_pairs = len(successful_pairs)\n\n# Calculate probability\nprobability = num_successful_pairs / total_pairs\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set is a multiple of 63.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set is a multiple of 63. The probability is approximately 0.2857. To express this as a common fraction, we can convert it to \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
