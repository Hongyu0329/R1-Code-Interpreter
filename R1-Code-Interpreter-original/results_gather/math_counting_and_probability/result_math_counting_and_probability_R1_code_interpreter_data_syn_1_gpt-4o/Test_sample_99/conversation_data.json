    "To find the expected value of a roll of a fair octahedral die, we need to calculate the average of all possible outcomes. An octahedral die has 8 faces, numbered from 1 to 8. The expected value \\( E \\) is calculated as the sum of all possible outcomes, each multiplied by their probability of occurring.\n\nSince the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of landing face up, which is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nThe expected value \\( E \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ E = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} i \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{8} \\times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expected value of a fair octahedral die\nfaces = list(range(1, 9))\nprobability = 1 / 8\nexpected_value = sum(face * probability for face in faces)\nprint(expected_value)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the expected value of the roll of a fair octahedral die.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the expected value of a roll of a fair octahedral die. The expected value is the average of all possible outcomes, each weighted by their probability. Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nThe sum of the numbers from 1 to 8 is 36, and when divided by 8, the expected value is 4.5.\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the roll of a fair octahedral die is:\n\n<<<4.5>>>"
