    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of 5 rolled dice is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself, meaning it has more than two distinct positive divisors.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - Each die has 6 faces, so with 5 dice, there are \\(6^5\\) total possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Composite Number Identification**:\n   - A composite number is any number that is not prime and greater than 1. \n   - The only non-composite numbers (other than 1) are prime numbers.\n\n3. **Prime Numbers with 5 Dice**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2. \n   - The maximum product with 5 dice is \\(6^5\\).\n   - We need to identify if there are any prime numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the dice.\n\n4. **Special Cases**:\n   - The product of the numbers on the dice can be 1 if all dice show 1. This is not composite.\n   - We need to check if there are any other non-composite numbers that can be formed.\n\n5. **Calculate Composite Outcomes**:\n   - We will calculate the number of outcomes that result in a composite number by subtracting the number of outcomes that result in non-composite numbers from the total outcomes.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the number of composite outcomes.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return False\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return True\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return True\n        i += 6\n    return False\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 6 ** 5\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\ndice_faces = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\noutcomes = product(dice_faces, repeat=5)\n\n# Count composite outcomes\ncomposite_count = 0\nfor outcome in outcomes:\n    product_value = 1\n    for number in outcome:\n        product_value *= number\n    if is_composite(product_value):\n        composite_count += 1\n\n# Calculate probability\nprobability_composite = composite_count / total_outcomes\nprint(probability_composite)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of 5 rolled dice is a composite number. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of 5 rolled dice is a composite number. The result is approximately 0.9979.\n\nThis means that there is a very high probability that the product will be a composite number, given the large number of possible outcomes and the nature of composite numbers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.9979423868312757>>>"
