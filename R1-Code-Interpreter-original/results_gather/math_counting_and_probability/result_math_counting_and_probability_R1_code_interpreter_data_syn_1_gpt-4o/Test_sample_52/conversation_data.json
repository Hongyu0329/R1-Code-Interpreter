    "To find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\sqrt{x}+\\dfrac{5}{x}\\right)^{9}\\), we need to use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(a = \\sqrt{x}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{5}{x}\\), and \\(n = 9\\).\n\nThe general term in the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{9}{k} (\\sqrt{x})^{9-k} \\left(\\frac{5}{x}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the powers of \\(x\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{9}{k} x^{\\frac{9-k}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{5^k}{x^k} = \\binom{9}{k} \\cdot 5^k \\cdot x^{\\frac{9-k}{2} - k}\n\\]\n\nFor the term to be constant, the power of \\(x\\) must be zero:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9-k}{2} - k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9-k}{2} = k \\\\\n9 - k = 2k \\\\\n9 = 3k \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(k = 3\\) back into the expression for \\(T_k\\) to find the constant term:\n\n\\[\nT_3 = \\binom{9}{3} \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot x^{0}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nn = 9\nk = 3\nbinomial_coefficient = math.comb(n, k)\nconstant_term = binomial_coefficient * (5 ** k)\n\nprint(constant_term)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the constant term in the expansion.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\sqrt{x}+\\dfrac{5}{x}\\right)^{9}\\). The constant term is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_3 = \\binom{9}{3} \\cdot 5^3\n\\]\n\nThe output of the code confirms that the constant term is 10500.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in the expansion is:\n\n<<<10500>>>"
