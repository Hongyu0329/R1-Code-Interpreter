    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes. This is a classic combinatorics problem that can be solved using the \"stars and bars\" method.\n\nThe \"stars and bars\" theorem provides a way to find the number of ways to put \\( n \\) indistinguishable items into \\( k \\) distinguishable bins. The formula is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, \\( n = 5 \\) (the number of balls) and \\( k = 2 \\) (the number of boxes). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{6}{1}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of balls\nn = 5\n# Number of boxes\nk = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of ways using the stars and bars method\nways = math.comb(n + k - 1, k - 1)\nprint(ways)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the number of ways to distribute the balls into the boxes.",
    "The code execution confirms that there are 6 ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes. This result is consistent with the application of the \"stars and bars\" method.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
