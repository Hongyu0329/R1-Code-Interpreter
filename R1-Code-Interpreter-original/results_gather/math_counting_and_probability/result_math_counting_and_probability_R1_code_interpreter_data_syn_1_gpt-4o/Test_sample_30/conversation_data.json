    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) within the rectangle satisfies the condition \\(x < y\\).\n\n1. **Define the Rectangle**: The rectangle is defined by the vertices \\((0,0)\\), \\((3,0)\\), \\((3,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\). This means the rectangle spans from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\) and from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Region where \\(x < y\\)**: The line \\(x = y\\) is a diagonal line that starts from \\((0,0)\\) and ends at \\((2,2)\\) within the bounds of the rectangle. The region where \\(x < y\\) is above this line and within the rectangle.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Region where \\(x < y\\)**:\n   - The line \\(x = y\\) intersects the top boundary of the rectangle at \\((2,2)\\).\n   - The region where \\(x < y\\) is a right triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((0,2)\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of the Triangle**:\n   - The base of the triangle is along the line \\(y = 2\\) from \\((0,2)\\) to \\((2,2)\\), which is 2 units long.\n   - The height of the triangle is along the line \\(x = 0\\) from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((0,2)\\), which is 2 units long.\n   - The area of the triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Area of the Rectangle**:\n   - The area of the rectangle is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability**:\n   - The probability that a randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) satisfies \\(x < y\\) is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle: \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the vertices of the rectangle\nrectangle_vertices = [(0, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (0, 2)]\n\n# Calculate the area of the rectangle\nrectangle_area = 3 * 2\n\n# Define the vertices of the triangle where x < y\ntriangle_vertices = [(0, 0), (2, 2), (0, 2)]\n\n# Calculate the area of the triangle\ntriangle_base = 2  # from (0, 2) to (2, 2)\ntriangle_height = 2  # from (0, 0) to (0, 2)\ntriangle_area = 0.5 * triangle_base * triangle_height\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = triangle_area / rectangle_area\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the probability calculation.",
    "The code execution confirms that the probability of randomly picking a point \\((x, y)\\) from inside the rectangle such that \\(x < y\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.3333333333333333>>>"
