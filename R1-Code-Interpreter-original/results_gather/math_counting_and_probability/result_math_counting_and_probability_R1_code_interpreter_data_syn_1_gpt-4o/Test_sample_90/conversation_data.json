    "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from tossing three standard dice equals 180. \n\nFirst, let's consider the possible outcomes when three dice are tossed. Each die has 6 faces, so there are a total of \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\\) possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the product \\(abc = 180\\). \n\nThe prime factorization of 180 is:\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\]\n\nSince each die can show a number from 1 to 6, we need to check which combinations of numbers from these dice can multiply to give 180. The numbers on the dice are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\nLet's list the possible combinations of numbers that can multiply to 180:\n- The number 6 can be expressed as \\(2 \\times 3\\).\n- The number 4 can be expressed as \\(2^2\\).\n- The number 5 is a prime factor itself.\n- The number 3 is a prime factor itself.\n\nWe need to find combinations of these numbers that multiply to 180. We can use a brute force approach to check all possible combinations of three numbers from the set \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} and see which ones multiply to 180.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find all such combinations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Possible numbers on a die\ndice_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Count the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_count = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes of three dice\nfor a, b, c in product(dice_numbers, repeat=3):\n    if a * b * c == 180:\n        favorable_count += 1\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 6 ** 3\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = favorable_count / total_outcomes\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability by counting the number of favorable outcomes and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's execute the code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from tossing three standard dice equals 180. The probability is approximately 0.013888888888888888.\n\nNow, let's express this probability in a more standard form, such as a fraction or a percentage.\n\nThe probability 0.013888888888888888 can be expressed as a fraction by recognizing that it is equivalent to \\( \\frac{1}{72} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the numbers obtained from tossing three standard dice equals 180 is \\( \\frac{1}{72} \\).\n\n<<<1/72>>>"
