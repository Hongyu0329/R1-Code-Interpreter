    "To find the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle, we need to understand how Pascal's triangle is constructed. Each number in Pascal's triangle is a binomial coefficient, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the row number and \\( k \\) is the position in the row, both starting from 0.\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) such that \\( C(n, k) \\) is a three-digit number (i.e., between 100 and 999 inclusive).\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the binomial coefficients and find the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_smallest_three_digit_in_pascals_triangle():\n    for n in range(1, 100):  # Start from 1 since C(0, 0) = 1\n        for k in range(n + 1):\n            binom_coeff = math.comb(n, k)\n            if 100 <= binom_coeff <= 999:\n                return binom_coeff\n\nprint(find_smallest_three_digit_in_pascals_triangle())\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over possible values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\), calculate the binomial coefficient, and check if it falls within the range of three-digit numbers. The first such number found will be the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle.",
    "The code has successfully found the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle, which is 126. \n\nThe reasoning behind this is that the code iterates through possible values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\), calculates the binomial coefficient using the `math.comb` function, and checks if it falls within the range of three-digit numbers. The first such number found is returned as the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<126>>>"
