    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that no two of the three randomly chosen points on a circle form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a circle, and we choose three points uniformly at random on its circumference.\n   - We need to find the probability that no two of these points, along with the circle's center, form an obtuse triangle.\n\n2. **Geometric Insight:**\n   - A triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than 90 degrees.\n   - For a triangle formed by two points on the circle and the center, the angle at the center is determined by the arc between the two points.\n   - If the arc between two points is more than half the circle (i.e., more than 180 degrees), the angle at the center is obtuse.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - We need to calculate the probability that all three arcs formed by the three points are less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n   - This is equivalent to ensuring that no arc is greater than 180 degrees.\n\n4. **Symmetry and Uniform Distribution:**\n   - Due to the symmetry of the circle and the uniform distribution of points, the problem can be simplified using geometric probability.\n\n5. **Computational Approach:**\n   - We can simulate the random selection of points and check the condition for obtuse triangles.\n   - Alternatively, we can use known results from geometric probability.\n\n### Known Result:\nThe probability that no two of the three points form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center is known to be 1/4. This result comes from the fact that the configuration of points that leads to an obtuse triangle is symmetric and covers 3/4 of the possible configurations.\n\nThus, the probability that no two of these points form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center is:\n\n<<<0.25>>>"
