    "To determine how many perfect squares are between 50 and 250, we need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\geq 50 \\) and the largest integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m^2 \\leq 250 \\).\n\n1. **Find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\geq 50 \\):**\n   - Calculate the square root of 50 and round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n2. **Find the largest integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m^2 \\leq 250 \\):**\n   - Calculate the square root of 250 and round down to the nearest whole number.\n\n3. **Count the integers from \\( n \\) to \\( m \\) inclusive.**\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the smallest integer n such that n^2 >= 50\nn = math.ceil(math.sqrt(50))\n\n# Calculate the largest integer m such that m^2 <= 250\nm = math.floor(math.sqrt(250))\n\n# Count the number of perfect squares between 50 and 250\ncount = m - n + 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the number of perfect squares between 50 and 250.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 8 perfect squares between 50 and 250. \n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n- The smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\geq 50 \\) is 8, because \\( 8^2 = 64 \\).\n- The largest integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m^2 \\leq 250 \\) is 15, because \\( 15^2 = 225 \\).\n\nThe perfect squares between 50 and 250 are \\( 8^2, 9^2, 10^2, 11^2, 12^2, 13^2, 14^2, \\) and \\( 15^2 \\).\n\nThus, the number of perfect squares is \\( 15 - 8 + 1 = 8 \\).\n\n<<<8>>>"
