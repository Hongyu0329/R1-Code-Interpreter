    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many three-digit numbers are not multiples of either 5 or 7. \n\n1. **Identify the range of three-digit numbers**: The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers**: \n   - Total three-digit numbers = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5**:\n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 5 is 100, and the largest is 995.\n   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 100\\) and the common difference \\(d = 5\\).\n   - The number of terms \\(n\\) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\\).\n   - Solving for \\(n\\) when \\(a_n = 995\\), we get: \\(995 = 100 + (n-1) \\cdot 5\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7**:\n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 7 is 105, and the largest is 994.\n   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 105\\) and the common difference \\(d = 7\\).\n   - The number of terms \\(n\\) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\\).\n   - Solving for \\(n\\) when \\(a_n = 994\\), we get: \\(994 = 105 + (n-1) \\cdot 7\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35)**:\n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105, and the largest is 980.\n   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 105\\) and the common difference \\(d = 35\\).\n   - The number of terms \\(n\\) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\\).\n   - Solving for \\(n\\) when \\(a_n = 980\\), we get: \\(980 = 105 + (n-1) \\cdot 35\\).\n\n6. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion** to find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of either 5 or 7:\n   - Let \\(A\\) be the set of multiples of 5, and \\(B\\) be the set of multiples of 7.\n   - The number of elements in \\(A \\cup B\\) is given by: \\(|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\\).\n\n7. **Subtract the number of multiples of either 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers** to find the number of numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5\nmultiples_of_5 = (995 - 100) // 5 + 1\n\n# Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7\nmultiples_of_7 = (994 - 105) // 7 + 1\n\n# Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35)\nmultiples_of_35 = (980 - 105) // 35 + 1\n\n# Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nmultiples_of_5_or_7 = multiples_of_5 + multiples_of_7 - multiples_of_35\n\n# Total number of three-digit numbers\ntotal_three_digit_numbers = 999 - 100 + 1\n\n# Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7\nmultiples_of_neither = total_three_digit_numbers - multiples_of_5_or_7\n\nprint(multiples_of_neither)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the answer.",
