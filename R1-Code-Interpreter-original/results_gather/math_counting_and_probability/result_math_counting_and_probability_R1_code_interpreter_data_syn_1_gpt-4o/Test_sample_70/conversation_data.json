    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other in a row of 7 chairs.\n\n1. **Total Ways to Seat Mary and James:**\n   - There are 7 chairs, and Mary and James can choose any of these chairs. \n   - The total number of ways to seat Mary and James is the number of ways to choose 2 chairs out of 7, which is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n   - For each choice of 2 chairs, Mary and James can sit in 2 different orders (Mary in the first chair and James in the second, or vice versa).\n\n2. **Ways to Seat Mary and James Next to Each Other:**\n   - If Mary and James are sitting next to each other, we can treat them as a single \"block\" or \"unit.\"\n   - There are 6 possible positions for this \"block\" in a row of 7 chairs (positions 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7).\n   - For each position of the \"block,\" Mary and James can switch places, giving us 2 arrangements per position.\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is given by:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not next to each other}) = 1 - P(\\text{next to each other})\n     \\]\n   - We can calculate \\( P(\\text{next to each other}) \\) as the ratio of the number of ways they can sit next to each other to the total number of ways they can sit.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of ways to seat Mary and James\ntotal_ways = math.comb(7, 2) * 2\n\n# Number of ways to seat Mary and James next to each other\nways_next_to_each_other = 6 * 2\n\n# Probability that they are not sitting next to each other\nprobability_not_next_to_each_other = 1 - (ways_next_to_each_other / total_ways)\n\nprint(probability_not_next_to_each_other)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other. The probability is approximately 0.7143.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other in a row of 7 chairs is:\n\n<<<0.7143>>>"
