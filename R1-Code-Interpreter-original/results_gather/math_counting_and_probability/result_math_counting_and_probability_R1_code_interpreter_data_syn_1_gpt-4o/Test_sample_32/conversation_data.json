    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many unique planes can be formed by choosing three non-collinear points from a set of 12 points in space.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - A plane is determined by three non-collinear points.\n   - We have 12 points, and we need to choose 3 points to form a plane.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 points from 12 is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of points, and \\( k \\) is the number of points to choose.\n\n2. **Non-Collinearity Consideration:**\n   - We assume that no three points are collinear, which means every combination of three points will form a unique plane.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - We need to calculate \\( C(12, 3) \\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total number of points\nn = 12\n# Number of points to choose to form a plane\nk = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\nnumber_of_planes = math.comb(n, k)\n\nprint(number_of_planes)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of unique planes that can be formed by choosing 3 points from 12, assuming no three points are collinear.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the number of unique planes that can be formed by choosing 3 points from a set of 12 points, assuming no three points are collinear. The result is 220.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space is:\n\n<<<220>>>"
