    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling six distinct numbers when rolling six standard six-sided dice. \n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling six dice, the total number of possible outcomes is \\(6^6\\).\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**:\n   To have six distinct numbers, each die must show a different number from 1 to 6. The number of ways to arrange six distinct numbers is the number of permutations of 6 distinct numbers, which is \\(6!\\).\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   The probability of rolling six distinct numbers is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 6 ** 6\n\n# Favorable outcomes (permutations of 6 distinct numbers)\nfavorable_outcomes = math.factorial(6)\n\n# Probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling six distinct numbers when rolling six standard six-sided dice. The result is approximately 0.015432098765432098. \n\nTo express this probability as a common fraction, we can convert the decimal to a fraction. The decimal 0.015432098765432098 is equivalent to the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{65}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers with six dice is \\(\\frac{1}{65}\\).\n\n<<<1/65>>>"
