    "To solve the problem, we need to find all integer values \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\(\\binom{21}{11}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{21}{11} = \\frac{21!}{11! \\cdot 10!}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that \\(\\binom{20}{10}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{10} = \\frac{20!}{10! \\cdot 10!}\n\\]\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\frac{21!}{11! \\cdot 10!}\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{n} = \\frac{21!}{11! \\cdot 10!} - \\binom{20}{10}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find all integer values of \\( n \\) such that the above equation holds. Let's compute these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate binomial coefficients\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    return math.comb(n, k)\n\n# Calculate the required values\nbinom_21_11 = binomial_coefficient(21, 11)\nbinom_20_10 = binomial_coefficient(20, 10)\n\n# Find all n such that binom_20_n + binom_20_10 = binom_21_11\nvalid_n = []\nfor n in range(21):  # n can be from 0 to 20\n    if binomial_coefficient(20, n) + binom_20_10 == binom_21_11:\n        valid_n.append(n)\n\n# Calculate the sum of all valid n\nsum_valid_n = sum(valid_n)\nprint(sum_valid_n)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the sum of all valid \\( n \\).",
    "The code execution indicates that the sum of all integer values \\( n \\) for which the equation holds is 20. \n\nThe reasoning behind this is that the equation \\(\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}\\) is satisfied for certain values of \\( n \\), and the sum of these values is calculated to be 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
