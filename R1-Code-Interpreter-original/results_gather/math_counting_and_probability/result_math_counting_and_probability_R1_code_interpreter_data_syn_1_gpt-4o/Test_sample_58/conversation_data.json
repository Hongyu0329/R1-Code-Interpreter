    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that when six 6-sided dice are rolled, the number of dice showing even numbers is equal to the number of dice showing odd numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice Roll:**\n   - A 6-sided die has three even numbers (2, 4, 6) and three odd numbers (1, 3, 5).\n   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single die is 1/2, and similarly, the probability of rolling an odd number is also 1/2.\n\n2. **Equal Number of Even and Odd Rolls:**\n   - We need exactly 3 dice to show even numbers and 3 dice to show odd numbers.\n   - This is a classic binomial probability problem where we want exactly 3 successes (even numbers) in 6 trials (dice rolls), with the probability of success (rolling an even number) being 1/2.\n\n3. **Binomial Probability Formula:**\n   - The probability of getting exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n     \\[\n     P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( n = 6 \\), \\( k = 3 \\), and \\( p = 1/2 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We will calculate the probability using the binomial formula.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of dice\nn = 6\n# Number of even numbers needed\nk = 3\n# Probability of rolling an even number\np = 0.5\n\n# Calculate the probability using the binomial formula\nprobability = comb(n, k) * (p ** k) * ((1 - p) ** (n - k))\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of rolling exactly 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers when rolling six 6-sided dice.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the probability of rolling exactly 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers when rolling six 6-sided dice. The probability is 0.3125.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal is:\n\n<<<0.3125>>>"
