    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that exactly two out of four 20-sided dice show an even number. \n\n1. **Determine the probability of rolling an even number on a single die:**\n   - A 20-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. Half of these numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 20) are even.\n   - Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on a single die is 10/20 = 1/2.\n\n2. **Determine the probability of rolling an odd number on a single die:**\n   - Similarly, the probability of rolling an odd number is also 1/2.\n\n3. **Use the binomial probability formula:**\n   - We want exactly 2 out of 4 dice to show an even number. This is a binomial probability problem where:\n     - n = 4 (number of trials)\n     - k = 2 (number of successful trials, i.e., rolling an even number)\n     - p = 1/2 (probability of success on a single trial)\n   - The binomial probability formula is given by:\n     \\[\n     P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k successes in n trials.\n\nLet's calculate this probability using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of dice\nn = 4\n# Number of even numbers desired\nk = 2\n# Probability of rolling an even number on a single die\np = 1/2\n\n# Calculate the probability using the binomial formula\nprobability = comb(n, k) * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(n-k))\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability that exactly two of the four dice show an even number.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the probability that exactly two out of four 20-sided dice show an even number. The probability is 0.375.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.375>>>"
