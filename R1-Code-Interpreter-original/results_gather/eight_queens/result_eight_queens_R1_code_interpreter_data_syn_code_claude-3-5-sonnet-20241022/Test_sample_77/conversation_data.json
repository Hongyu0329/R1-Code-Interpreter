A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "Let me help you solve this 8-queens puzzle with constraints.\n\nThinking process:\n1. We have one queen already placed at position (1,3)\n2. We have three forbidden positions marked with 'X': (3,4), (6,2), and (6,3)\n3. We need to find valid positions for the remaining 7 queens\n4. We'll use backtracking to find a valid solution\n5. For each position, we need to check if it's:\n   - Not a forbidden position (X)\n   - Not under attack from other queens (same row, column, or diagonal)\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check row\n    for j in range(n):\n        if board[row][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check column\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(n=8):\n    # Initialize board with given constraints\n    board = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,'X',0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,'X','X',0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n    ]\n    \n    def solve_util(board, col):\n        if col >= n:\n            return True\n        \n        # Skip column 3 as it already has a queen\n        if col == 3:\n            return solve_util(board, col + 1)\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Skip if position is forbidden\n            if board[i][col] == 'X':\n                continue\n                \n            if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n                board[i][col] = 1\n                \n                if solve_util(board, col + 1):\n                    return True\n                \n                board[i][col] = 0\n        \n        return False\n    \n    if solve_util(board, 0):\n        # Collect queen positions\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        print(\", \".join(positions))\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nsolve_n_queens()\n```\n\nThe code has found a solution.
