    "Let me help solve this 8-queens puzzle with constraints.\n\nThinking process:\n1. We need to implement a backtracking algorithm to find valid queen placements\n2. We need to consider:\n   - No two queens in same row, column, or diagonal\n   - Cannot place queens on positions marked with 'X'\n   - Need exactly 8 queens\n3. Let's write a program that:\n   - Represents the board with forbidden positions\n   - Implements validity checking for queen placement\n   - Uses backtracking to find a valid solution\n\nLet's implement this solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n    # Check row\n    for j in range(8):\n        if board[row][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check column\n    for i in range(8):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, 8), range(col, 8)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, 8)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, 8), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_queens(board, queens, solutions):\n    if queens == []:\n        # Initialize empty list of queen positions\n        queens = []\n    \n    if len(queens) == 8:\n        # Found a solution\n        queens.sort()  # Sort by row number\n        result = \", \".join(f\"{row} {col}\" for row, col in queens)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        return True\n    \n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(8):\n            # Skip if position is forbidden (X) or already has a queen\n            if board[row][col] == 'X' or board[row][col] == 1:\n                continue\n            \n            # Skip if this position is already in queens list\n            if (row, col) in queens:\n                continue\n            \n            if is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n                board[row][col] = 1\n                queens.append((row, col))\n                \n                if solve_queens(board, queens, solutions):\n                    return True\n                \n                board[row][col] = 0\n                queens.pop()\n    \n    return False\n\n# Initialize the board\nboard = [\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ['X',0,0,0,'X',0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,'X',0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,'X',0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n\nsolutions = []\nsolve_queens(board, [], solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will find a valid solution for placing 8 queens on the board while respecting all constraints. The solution will be printed in the required format.\n\nThe code implements:\n1. A function to check if a position is safe for queen placement\n2. A backtracking algorithm to try different combinations\n3. Handling of forbidden positions marked with 'X'\n4. Output formatting as required\n\nThe output will give us the positions of all 8 queens in the format <<<row1 col1, row2 col2, ...>>>, where each position represents a valid queen placement.\n\nThe solution provided by the code execution will be the final answer in the required format. Each position in the answer represents a row and column (0-based indices) where a queen should be placed, and the positions together form a valid solution where no two queens can attack each other.",
    "Now that we have the solution, let me verify it and explain the result.\n\nThe solution places queens at these positions:\n1. (0,0) - Top-left corner\n2. (1,5) - Second row, sixth column\n3. (2,7) - Third row, rightmost column\n4. (3,2) - Fourth row, third column\n5. (4,6) - Fifth row, seventh column\n6. (5,3) - Sixth row, fourth column\n7. (6,1) - Seventh row, second column\n8. (7,4) - Bottom row, fifth column\n\nLet's verify this solution:\n1. No queens are placed on forbidden 'X' positions (1,0), (1,4), (4,3), and (7,2)\n2. No two queens share the same row (each row has exactly one queen)\n3. No two queens share the same column (all column numbers are different)\n4. No two queens share the same diagonal (can be verified by checking all pairs)\n\nWe can visualize it (Q for queen, X for forbidden positions):\n```\nQ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nX 0 0 0 X Q 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Q\n0 0 Q 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 X 0 0 Q 0\n0 0 0 Q 0 0 0 0\n0 Q 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 X 0 Q 0 0 0\n```\n\nThis is indeed a valid solution that satisfies all the requirements.\n\n<<<0 0, 1 5, 2 7, 3 2, 4 6, 5 3, 6 1, 7 4>>>"
