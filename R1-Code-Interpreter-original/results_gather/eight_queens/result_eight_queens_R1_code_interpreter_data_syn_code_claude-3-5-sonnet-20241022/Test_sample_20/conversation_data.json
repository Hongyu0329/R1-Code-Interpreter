    "Let me help solve this 8-Queens puzzle with constraints.\n\nThinking process:\n1. We already have one queen at position (0,1)\n2. We have one forbidden position at (1,5) marked with 'X'\n3. We need to place 7 more queens\n4. We'll use backtracking to find a valid solution\n5. Need to check row, column, and diagonal constraints\n6.
