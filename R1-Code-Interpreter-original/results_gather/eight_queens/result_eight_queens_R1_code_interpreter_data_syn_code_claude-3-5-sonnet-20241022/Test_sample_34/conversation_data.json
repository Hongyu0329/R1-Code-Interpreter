    "Let me help you solve this 8-queens puzzle with constraints.\n\nThinking process:\n1. We already have two queens placed at (0,4) and (1,1)\n2. We have two forbidden positions at (5,2) and (6,2) marked with 'X'\n3. We need to find valid positions for the remaining 6 queens\n4. We'll use backtracking to find a valid solution\n5.
