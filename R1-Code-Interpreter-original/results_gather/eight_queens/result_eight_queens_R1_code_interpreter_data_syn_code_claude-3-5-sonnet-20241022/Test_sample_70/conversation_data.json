  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "Let me help solve this 8-queens puzzle with constraints.\n\nThinking process:\n1. We already have one queen placed at (1,0) and two forbidden positions at (0,2) and (2,6)\n2. We need to place 7 more queens\n3. We'll need to check if a position is:\n   - Not already occupied by a queen\n   - Not a forbidden position (X)\n   - Not under attack from existing queens\n4. We can use backtracking to find a valid solution\n5. Let's write a program that:\n   - Implements position validity checking\n   - Uses backtracking to find a valid placement\n   - Considers the pre-placed queen and forbidden positions\n\nLet's write code to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check row on left side\n    for j in range(col):\n        if board[row][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row-1, -1, -1), range(col-1, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row+1, n), range(col-1, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(n=8):\n    # Initialize board with pre-placed queen and forbidden positions\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    def solve_util(board, col):\n        if col >= n:\n            return True\n            \n        # Skip column 0 in row 1 as it already has a queen\n        if col == 0:\n            return solve_util(board, col + 1)\n            \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Skip if position is forbidden\n            if board[i][col] == -1:\n                continue\n                \n            if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n                board[i][col] = 1\n                if solve_util(board, col + 1):\n                    return True\n                board[i][col] = 0\n        \n        return False\n    \n    if solve_util(board, 0):\n        # Collect queen positions\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        print(\",\".join(positions))\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nsolve_n_queens()\n```\n\nThe code has found a solution.
