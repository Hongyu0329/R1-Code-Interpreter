    "Let me help you solve this 8-queens puzzle with the given constraints.\n\nThinking process:\n1. We already have one queen placed at position (3,4)\n2. We need to place 7 more queens\n3. We'll use backtracking to find a valid solution\n4. For each position, we need to check if it's safe from attacks by other queens\n5.
