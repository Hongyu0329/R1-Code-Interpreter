A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is an 8x8 grid, and we have one queen already placed at position (0, 4). We need to place 7 more queens.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n2. Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board and then use a backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens.\n\n1. The board is initially:\n   ```\n   00001000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   ```\n   This means a queen is placed at (0, 4).\n\n2. We need to place queens in the remaining rows (1 to 7) such that they do not conflict with the queen at (0, 4).\n\n3. We will use a backtracking approach to try placing queens row by row, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find a valid configuration.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 0\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 1\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 2\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 3\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 4\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 5\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Row 6\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  # Row 7\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 1):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(len(board)):\n            for j in range(len(board[i])):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\nprint(find_queen_positions())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach and return the positions of all queens if a solution is found.",
