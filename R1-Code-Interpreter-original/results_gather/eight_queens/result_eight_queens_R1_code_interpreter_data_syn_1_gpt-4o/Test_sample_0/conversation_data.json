    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place 8 queens in total.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row.\n   - No two queens can be in the same column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we will try placing a queen in each column that is not already attacked by another queen and is not marked with 'X'.\n   - If we can place a queen, we move to the next row. If not, we backtrack and try a different position for the previous queen.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[row][i] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][i] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens(n):\n    board = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return result\n\nprint(solve_n_queens(8))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and return the positions of the queens if a solution is found. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
