A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We need to understand which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or blocked by 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the available positions**: We need to find positions where we can place the remaining queens without violating the constraints.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in available positions and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Output the solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, we will output the positions of all queens.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n, result):\n    # base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[i][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            result.append((i, col))\n\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    # If the queen can not be placed in any row in this column col then return false\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    result = []\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n, result):\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\n    return result\n\n# Get the solution\nsolution = solve_n_queens()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, respecting the constraints of the problem.
