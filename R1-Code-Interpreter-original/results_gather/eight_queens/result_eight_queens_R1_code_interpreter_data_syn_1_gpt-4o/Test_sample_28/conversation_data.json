    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and we need to respect the constraints of the problem, including the blocked cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with some queens already placed. We need to identify these positions and the blocked positions.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in the remaining rows.\n   - We will check for conflicts in rows, columns, and diagonals.\n   - We will skip any cell marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will represent the board as a list of lists.\n   - We will iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a valid column.\n   - We will use a recursive function to attempt placing queens in subsequent rows.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens_positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Initial positions of queens\nqueens_positions = [(1, 1), (6, 4)]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, queens_positions)\n\n# Format the output\noutput = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in sorted(queens_positions))\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
