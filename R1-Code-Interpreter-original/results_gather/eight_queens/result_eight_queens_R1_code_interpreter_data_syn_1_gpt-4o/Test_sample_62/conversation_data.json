    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the board, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem is essentially a variation of the classic \"Eight Queens\" problem, with additional constraints due to the blocked cells.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints**: We need to place 8 queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. Additionally, we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens on the board. We will place a queen in a row and then move to the next row, ensuring that the placement does not violate any constraints.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: For each placement, we need to check if the queen is not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queens.\n\n4. **Recursive Search**: If a valid placement is found, we move to the next row. If not, we backtrack and try a different position.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, we output their positions.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[row][i] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][i] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens(n):\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return result\n\nn = 8\nresult = solve_n_queens(n)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place queens on the board using a backtracking approach and print the positions of the queens once a valid configuration is found. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code provided successfully solves the classic \"Eight Queens\" problem without considering any blocked cells ('X'). However, the problem statement mentioned that there are blocked cells, but the initial board provided was all zeros, indicating no blocked cells. \n\nIf there are specific blocked cells, we need to incorporate them into the board setup. Since the initial board was all zeros, let's assume there are no blocked cells for now. If you have specific blocked cells, please provide their positions, and I can adjust the code accordingly.\n\nGiven the output, the solution places queens at the following positions:\n- Row 0, Column 0\n- Row 1, Column 4\n- Row 2, Column 7\n- Row 3, Column 5\n- Row 4, Column 2\n- Row 5, Column 6\n- Row 6, Column 1\n- Row 7, Column 3\n\nThis configuration ensures that no two queens threaten each other, adhering to the rules of the Eight Queens problem.\n\nIf you have any blocked cells or additional constraints, please let me know, and I can modify the solution accordingly. Otherwise, the solution provided is valid for the given input.\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
