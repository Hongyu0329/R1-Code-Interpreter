  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Some positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n   - We need to place 8 queens such that no two queens threaten each other.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - We start with an empty board and mark the positions with 'X' as unavailable.\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**:\n   - Place a queen in a row and move to the next row.\n   - Check if the current placement is valid (i.e., no queens in the same column or diagonal).\n   - If a valid placement is found, move to the next row.\n   - If no valid placement is possible, backtrack and try a different position in the previous rows.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a recursive function to attempt to place queens row by row.\n   - We will maintain a list of positions where queens are placed.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python code.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\nqueen_positions = place_queens()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and return the positions of the queens if a solution is found. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
