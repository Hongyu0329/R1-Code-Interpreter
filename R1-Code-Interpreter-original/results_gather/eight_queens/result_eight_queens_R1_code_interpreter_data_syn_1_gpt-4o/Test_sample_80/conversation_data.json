    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We have a partially filled board with one queen already placed at position (3, 7).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We cannot place queens in the same row, column, or diagonal as any other queen.\n   - We cannot place queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - We will skip rows and columns that are already occupied by a queen or marked with 'X'.\n   - We will check for diagonal conflicts before placing a queen.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will write a Python script to implement the backtracking algorithm and find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\nLet's write the code to solve this problem.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X' or board[row][col] == 1:\n            continue\n\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    ['X', 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\npositions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, respecting the constraints given.
