    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as not placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We need to understand which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or blocked by 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the available positions**: For each row, identify the columns where a queen can be placed without being attacked or violating the constraints.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: Use a backtracking approach to try placing queens in the available positions, ensuring that each placement does not lead to a conflict.\n\n4. **Output the positions of all queens**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens on the board.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, queens):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, queens):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    queens = []\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, queens)\n    return queens\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
