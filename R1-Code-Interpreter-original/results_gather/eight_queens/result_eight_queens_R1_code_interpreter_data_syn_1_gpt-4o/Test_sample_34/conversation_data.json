    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and we have some constraints due to the 'X' marks where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with some queens already placed. We need to identify the positions of these queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Objective**: Place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row.\n   - Ensure that the placement does not violate any constraints.\n   - If a valid configuration is found, return the positions of all queens.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[row][i] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            result.append((row, i))\n\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][i] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    result = []\n    # Add already placed queens to result\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                result.append((i, j))\n\n    if solve_n_queens_util(board, len(result), n, result):\n        return result\n    else:\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\nsolution = solve_n_queens()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
