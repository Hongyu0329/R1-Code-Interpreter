  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as avoiding the 'X' marked cells.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Some cells are marked with 'X', which means queens cannot be placed there.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - We will represent the board as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row.\n   - We will mark the positions of the queens and the 'X' cells.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we will try placing a queen in each column, checking if the position is valid (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not marked with 'X').\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**:\n   - A position is valid if there is no other queen in the same column, and no other queen on the same diagonals.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col):\n    # Check column\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens_positions):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n    \n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_valid(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n    \n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable value\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\nqueens_positions = []\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, queens_positions)\n\n# Output the positions of the queens\nprint(queens_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and avoiding the 'X' marked cells. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a list of positions where the queens can be placed on the board. The output indicates the positions of the queens in the format of (row, column) pairs.\n\nLet's convert this output into the required format:\n\nThe positions of the queens are:\n- Row 0, Column 0\n- Row 1, Column 6\n- Row 2, Column 3\n- Row 3, Column 5\n- Row 4, Column 7\n- Row 5, Column 1\n- Row 6, Column 4\n- Row 7, Column 2\n\nNow, let's format this into the required output format:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 6, 2 3, 3 5, 4 7, 5 1, 6 4, 7 2>>>"
