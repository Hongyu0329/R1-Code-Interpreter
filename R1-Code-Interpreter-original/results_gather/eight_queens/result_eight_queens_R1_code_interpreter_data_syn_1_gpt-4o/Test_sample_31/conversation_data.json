    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We have a partially filled board with some queens already placed. We need to identify these positions and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the constraints**: \n   - Each row and column can have only one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row, ensuring that the placement is valid according to the constraints.\n\n4. **Check for validity**: For each potential position, we need to check if placing a queen there would violate any of the constraints.\n\n5. **Recursive placement**: If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row. If no valid position is found, we backtrack and try a different position for the previous queen.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, queens_positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_valid(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, queens_positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    queens_positions = [(6, 1)]\n\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, queens_positions)\n\n    return queens_positions\n\nqueens_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queens_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
