    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed and some cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\n2. **Determine the positions of the existing queens**: We need to identify which rows and columns already have queens.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: We need to place the remaining queens in such a way that they do not attack each other, considering the constraints.\n\n4. **Check for valid positions**: For each row, find a valid column where a queen can be placed without being attacked by another queen.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to help us find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, len(board), 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, col, positions):\n    if col >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if board[i][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, i, col):\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            positions.append((i, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, col + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[i][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 'X', 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(0, 2)]\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions)\n    return positions\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
