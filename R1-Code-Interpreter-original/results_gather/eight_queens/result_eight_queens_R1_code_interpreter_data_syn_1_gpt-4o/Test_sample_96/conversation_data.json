    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens. We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial board setup**: We will represent the board as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row. We will mark the positions of the queens and the restricted positions.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens. This involves placing a queen in a valid position and then recursively attempting to place the next queen. If a conflict arises, we backtrack and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check for conflicts**: For each queen placement, we need to check if it conflicts with any previously placed queens. This includes checking the same row, column, and both diagonals.\n\n5. **Output the solution**: Once all queens are placed successfully, we will output their positions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, len(board), 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, col):\n    if col >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if board[i][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, i, col):\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, col + 1):\n                return True\n            board[i][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(len(board)):\n            for j in range(len(board[i])):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return []\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable value\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output the positions of the queens. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
