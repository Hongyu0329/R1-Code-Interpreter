    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. We have a partially filled board with one queen already placed at position (2, 7) and a restricted position at (2, 5) marked with 'X'. \n\nThe constraints are:\n1. No two queens can be in the same row.\n2. No two queens can be in the same column.\n3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board state and then use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens.\n\n### Current Board State:\n- Queen at (2, 7)\n- Restricted position at (2, 5)\n\n### Steps:\n1. We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n2. We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n### Approach:\n- Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n- For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not already occupied or restricted.\n- Check if the position is safe (i.e., not attacked by any other queen).\n- If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n- If placing a queen leads to a dead end, backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Place the initial queen\nboard[2][7] = 1\n\n# List to store the positions of queens\npositions = [(2, 7)]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, positions)\n\n# Output the positions\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and output their positions.

This is not a valid solution for the N-Queens problem. Let's correct the approach and ensure that we are placing queens correctly without violating the constraints.\n\n### Corrected Approach:\n1.
