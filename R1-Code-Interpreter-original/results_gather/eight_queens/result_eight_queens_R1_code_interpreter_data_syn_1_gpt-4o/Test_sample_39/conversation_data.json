    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We need to determine which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or blocked by 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the available positions**: For each row, find the columns where a queen can be placed without being attacked by another queen or blocked by 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in the available positions, ensuring that each placement does not lead to a conflict.\n\n4. **Output the positions**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a large number to indicate blocked positions\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = float('inf')\n\n    # Start solving from the first row\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result)\n\n    # Convert result to the required format\n    result_str = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result)\n    return result_str\n\nprint(find_queen_positions())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output the positions of all queens.",
    "It seems there was an error in the code execution. Let's review the code and correct any issues.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, I noticed a few potential issues:\n\n1.
