    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed and some cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row must have exactly one queen.\n   - Each column must have exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we will try placing a queen in each column that is not already occupied by another queen or marked with 'X'.\n   - We will check if placing a queen in a particular cell is valid by ensuring it does not conflict with any previously placed queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row. If not, we backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    result = []\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result)\n    return result\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach and return the positions of all queens once a valid configuration is found.",
