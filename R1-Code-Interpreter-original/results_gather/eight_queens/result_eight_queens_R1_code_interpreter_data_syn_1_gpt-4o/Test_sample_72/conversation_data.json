    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The board is partially filled, and we have constraints where queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with some queens already placed. We need to identify these positions and the positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Objective**: Place the remaining queens on the board while satisfying the above constraints.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not under attack by another queen and is not marked with 'X'.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row.\n   - If a row cannot be completed, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    positions = []\n\n    # Mark 'X' positions as -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    # Start solving from the first row\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions)\n\n    # Convert positions to the required format\n    result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions)\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nfind_queen_positions()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints. The output will be the positions of all queens in the required format.",
