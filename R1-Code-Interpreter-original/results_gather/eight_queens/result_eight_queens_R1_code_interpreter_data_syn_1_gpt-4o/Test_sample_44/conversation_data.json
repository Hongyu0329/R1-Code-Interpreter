    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We need to determine which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or blocked by 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the available positions**: For each row, find the columns where a queen can be placed without being attacked by another queen or being in a blocked position.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: Use a backtracking approach to try placing queens in the available positions, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other.\n\n4. **Output the positions of all queens**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens on the board.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, queens):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, queens):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    queens = [(2, 4), (5, 5)]  # Pre-placed queens\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, queens):\n        return queens\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "It seems there was an issue with the initial approach. Let's re-evaluate the problem and adjust the strategy. The key is to ensure that we correctly handle the constraints and the initial placement of queens.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We need to correctly interpret the board, including the positions of the pre-placed queens and the blocked positions ('X').\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: We need to ensure that the backtracking algorithm correctly skips over blocked positions and respects the initial placement of queens.\n\nLet's refine the code to address these issues:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, queens):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # If there's already a queen in this row, skip to the next row\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 1:\n            return solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, queens)\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, queens):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    queens = [(2, 4), (5, 5)]  # Pre-placed queens\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, queens):\n        return queens\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code to see if it correctly finds a solution.",
