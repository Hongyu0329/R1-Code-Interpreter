    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the board, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. The challenge is to find a valid configuration that satisfies these constraints.\n\nGiven that the board is initially empty, we can use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens. The backtracking algorithm will try to place a queen in each row, ensuring that it does not conflict with any previously placed queens. If a conflict arises, the algorithm will backtrack and try a different position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if is_safe(board, row, i):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][i] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\nprint(place_queens())\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `is_safe` to check if a queen can be placed at a given position without being attacked. The `solve_n_queens` function uses backtracking to place queens row by row. Finally, `place_queens` initializes the board and calls the solver, returning the positions of the queens.\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution.",
