    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is an 8x8 grid, and we have some constraints:\n\n1. A queen is already placed at position (1, 4).\n2. The position (3, 0) is marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n3. We need to place a total of 8 queens on the board.\n\nThe approach involves using backtracking to try placing queens in each row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.
