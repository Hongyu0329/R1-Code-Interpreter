    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with some queens already placed. We need to identify the positions of these queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row and column can have only one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are off-limits.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens.\n   - We will start from the first row and try to place a queen in each column, checking if the position is valid (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not marked with 'X').\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[row][i] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            positions.append((row, i))\n\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][i] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(4, 4), (6, 0)]\n\n    if solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n, positions):\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\npositions = solve_n_queens()\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
