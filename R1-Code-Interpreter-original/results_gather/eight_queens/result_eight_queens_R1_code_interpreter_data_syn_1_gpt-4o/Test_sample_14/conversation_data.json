    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have an 8x8 grid, and we need to place 8 queens.\n2. Some cells are marked with 'X', which means we cannot place queens there.\n3. We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nGiven the initial board configuration, we need to find a valid placement for the queens. We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row, ensuring that each placement is valid.\n\nLet's write a Python script to implement this logic and find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to place the queens on the board using a backtracking approach, respecting the constraints of the problem. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
