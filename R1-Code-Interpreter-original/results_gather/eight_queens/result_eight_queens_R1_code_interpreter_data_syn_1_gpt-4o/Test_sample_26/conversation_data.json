    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and we have constraints due to the 'X' marks where queens cannot be placed.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We need to parse the board to identify where the queens are already placed and where the 'X' marks are.\n2. **Determine the Remaining Queens**: Since there are 8 queens in total and some are already placed, we need to determine how many more queens need to be placed.\n3. **Check Constraints**: Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n4. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing the remaining queens on the board, respecting the constraints.\n\n### Implementation:\nWe'll write a Python script to implement the backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, len(board), 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col):\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':  # Skip 'X' marked positions\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, i, col):\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1):\n                return True\n            board[i][col] = 0  # Backtrack\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a special marker\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = 'X'\n            elif board[i][j] == 1:\n                board[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                board[i][j] = 0\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0):\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                queen_positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return queen_positions\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solve_n_queens())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other and respecting the 'X' constraints.
