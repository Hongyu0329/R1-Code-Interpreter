    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Current board state**:\n   - The board is initially empty except for the 'X' positions.\n   - We need to place all 8 queens.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column.\n   - For each column, try placing the queen in all rows one by one and check if it is safe to place the queen there.\n   - If placing the queen in a row leads to a solution, return true.\n   - If placing the queen in any row doesn't lead to a solution, backtrack and remove the queen from the row and try the next row.\n\n4. **Safety check**:\n   - Ensure no other queen is in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure the position is not marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, len(board), 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col):\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, i, col):\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 1\n\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1):\n                return True\n\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 0\n\n    # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0):\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board)):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                queen_positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return queen_positions\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solve_n_queens())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and return the positions of the queens if a solution is found.",
    "The code successfully found a solution to the problem, placing the queens in positions that satisfy all the constraints. The output is a list of positions where the queens are placed on the board.\n\nLet's interpret the output:\n\n- The queens are placed at the following positions:\n  - Row 0, Column 0\n  - Row 1, Column 6\n  - Row 2, Column 4\n  - Row 3, Column 7\n  - Row 4, Column 1\n  - Row 5, Column 3\n  - Row 6, Column 5\n  - Row 7, Column 2\n\nThese positions ensure that no two queens can attack each other, and no queens are placed on the 'X' marked positions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 6, 2 4, 3 7, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 2>>>"
