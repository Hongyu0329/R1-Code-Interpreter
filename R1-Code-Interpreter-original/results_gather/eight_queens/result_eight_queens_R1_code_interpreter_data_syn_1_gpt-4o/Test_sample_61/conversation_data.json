    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X', which cannot be used for placing queens.\n\n2. **Check existing placements**: We need to ensure that any existing queens (marked with '1') are not in conflict with each other. However, the board provided does not have any queens placed yet.\n\n3. **Place the queens**: We need to place 8 queens on the board, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other. This involves checking rows, columns, and diagonals for conflicts.\n\n4. **Respect the 'X' constraints**: Ensure that no queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row, checking for conflicts, and backtracking if a conflict arises.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and ensuring no two queens can attack each other. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
