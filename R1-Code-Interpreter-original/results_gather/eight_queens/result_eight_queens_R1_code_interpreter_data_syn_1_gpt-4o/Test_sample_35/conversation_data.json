  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and some positions are marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row and each column must have exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n2. **Current Board State**:\n   - Row 0: Queen at column 0\n   - Row 1: Queen at column 0\n   - Row 2: Queen at column 2\n   - Row 3: Blocked at column 4\n   - Row 4: Empty\n   - Row 5: Empty\n   - Row 6: Blocked at column 7\n   - Row 7: Blocked at column 3\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We need to place queens in the remaining rows (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) while respecting the constraints.\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to try placing queens in each row and check if the placement is valid.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Solve the board\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0)\n\n# Collect the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = []\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            queen_positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other and avoiding the blocked positions.
