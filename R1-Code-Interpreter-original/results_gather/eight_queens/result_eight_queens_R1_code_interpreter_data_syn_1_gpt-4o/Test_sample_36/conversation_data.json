    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some cells marked as 'X', where queens cannot be placed. We need to place 8 queens in total, ensuring no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: We start with an empty board and mark the positions where queens cannot be placed due to 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. For each row, we try placing a queen in each column that is not under attack by another queen and is not marked with 'X'. If we find a valid position, we move to the next row. If we cannot place a queen in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Check for Attacks**: For each position, we need to check if placing a queen there would result in an attack. This involves checking the current column, and both diagonals.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(len(board)):\n            for j in range(len(board)):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return []\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and return the positions of the queens. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
