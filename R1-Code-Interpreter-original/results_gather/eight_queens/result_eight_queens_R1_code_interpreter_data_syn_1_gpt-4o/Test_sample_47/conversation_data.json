    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We need to determine which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or blocked by 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine available positions**: For each row, find the columns where a queen can be placed without being attacked by another queen or being on a blocked cell.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in available positions row by row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other.\n\n4. **Output the solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ['X', 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable value, e.g., -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    # Place the already placed queen\n    result.append((1, 3))\n    board[1][3] = 1\n\n    # Solve the rest of the board\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result)\n\n    # Convert result to the required format\n    result_str = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result)\n    return result_str\n\nprint(find_queen_positions())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other and avoiding cells marked with 'X'.
