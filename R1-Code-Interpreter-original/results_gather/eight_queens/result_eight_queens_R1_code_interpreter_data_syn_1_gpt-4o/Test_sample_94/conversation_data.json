A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints:**\n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Some positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n   - We need to place 8 queens such that no two queens can attack each other.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We will represent the board as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row.\n   - We will use backtracking to try placing queens in valid positions.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach:**\n   - Start from the first row and try placing a queen in each column.\n   - For each placement, check if it is valid (i.e., not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queen and not on an 'X').\n   - If valid, move to the next row and repeat.\n   - If a row cannot have a queen placed, backtrack to the previous row and try the next column.\n\n4. **Check Validity:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same column.\n   - Ensure no two queens are on the same diagonal.\n   - Ensure the position is not marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Output the Solution:**\n   - Once all queens are placed, output their positions.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, queens):\n    # Check if the column is safe\n    for r, c in queens:\n        if c == col or abs(r - row) == abs(c - col):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens):\n    if row == 8:\n        return queens\n    \n    for col in range(8):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_valid(board, row, col, queens):\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            result = solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens)\n            if result:\n                return result\n            queens.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Define the board\nboard = [\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', 'X', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'X', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'X', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'X'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\n# Solve the problem\nqueens = solve_n_queens(board, 0, [])\nprint(queens)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place queens on the board using a backtracking approach, respecting the constraints of the board. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a solution for placing the queens on the board. The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the position of a queen on the board in the format (row, column).\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 5, 2 7, 3 2, 4 6, 5 3, 6 1, 7 4>>>"
