    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the 'X' positions where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial setup**: We need to determine the current state of the board, including any queens already placed and the positions marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row, ensuring that each placement is valid. If we reach a point where no valid placement is possible, we backtrack and try a different configuration.\n\n4. **Check for validity**: For each potential placement of a queen, we need to check that it does not conflict with any existing queens or 'X' positions.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find a valid configuration for placing the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col):\n    # Check if there's a queen in the same column\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper left diagonal\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper right diagonal\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens_positions):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_valid(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    ['X', 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\nqueens_positions = []\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, queens_positions)\n\n# Convert positions to the required format\nresult = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens_positions)\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and return the positions of the queens in the required format.",
