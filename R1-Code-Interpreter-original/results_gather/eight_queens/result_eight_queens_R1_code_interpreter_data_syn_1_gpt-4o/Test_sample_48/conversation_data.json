    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and some positions are marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We need to parse the given board to identify the positions of the already placed queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in valid positions and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Output**: We need to return the positions of all eight queens once they are placed correctly.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to implement this logic.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n):\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':  # Skip restricted positions\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 1\n\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n):\n                return True\n\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 0\n\n    # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    if solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        # Collect the positions of the queens\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return []\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the N-Queens problem\nqueen_positions = solve_n_queens(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
