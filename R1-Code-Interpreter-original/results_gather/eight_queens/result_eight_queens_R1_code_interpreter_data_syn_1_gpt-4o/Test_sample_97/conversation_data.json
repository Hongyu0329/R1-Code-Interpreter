    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place 8 queens in total.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row.\n   - No two queens can be in the same column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we will try placing a queen in each column that is not marked with 'X' and is not under attack by any previously placed queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the positions of the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 'X', 'X', 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    result = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        return result\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board according to the given constraints and return the positions of the queens if a solution is found. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a solution for placing the queens on the board.
