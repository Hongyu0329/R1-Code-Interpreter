  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed and some cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\n2. **Determine the positions of the existing queens**: We need to identify the rows, columns, and diagonals that are already under attack by the existing queens.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: We need to find positions for the remaining queens such that they do not attack each other and do not violate the constraints.\n\n4. **Output the positions of all queens**: Once all queens are placed, we will output their positions.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to help us find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n):\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[i][col] = 0  # Backtrack\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0]\n    ]\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return positions\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solve_n_queens())\n```\n\nThis script attempts to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
