    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and some positions are marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row and each column must have exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n2. **Current Board**:\n   - Row 1 has a queen at column 2.\n   - Row 4 has a queen at column 1.\n   - Positions (4, 6) and (7, 2) are marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens.\n   - We will iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a valid column.\n   - We will check for conflicts with already placed queens and the 'X' positions.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
