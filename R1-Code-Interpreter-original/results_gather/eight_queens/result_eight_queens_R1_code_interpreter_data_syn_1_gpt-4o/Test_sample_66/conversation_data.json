    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is mostly empty, with one cell marked as 'X' at position (3, 6).\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we try placing a queen in each column, checking if it's a valid position.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a recursive function to attempt to place queens.\n   - We will maintain a list of columns, and diagonals (both major and minor) that are already occupied by queens.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, cols, diag1, diag2):\n    if cols[col] or diag1[row - col] or diag2[row + col] or board[row][col] == 'X':\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, cols, diag1, diag2, positions):\n    if row == 8:\n        return True\n    \n    for col in range(8):\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, cols, diag1, diag2):\n            # Place the queen\n            cols[col] = True\n            diag1[row - col] = True\n            diag2[row + col] = True\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            \n            # Recur to place the rest\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, cols, diag1, diag2, positions):\n                return True\n            \n            # Backtrack\n            cols[col] = False\n            diag1[row - col] = False\n            diag2[row + col] = False\n            positions.pop()\n    \n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'X', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n    ]\n    \n    cols = [False] * 8\n    diag1 = [False] * 15\n    diag2 = [False] * 15\n    positions = []\n    \n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, cols, diag1, diag2, positions):\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return []\n\npositions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board using a backtracking approach and return the positions of the queens if a solution is found. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the positions of the queens on the board. Now, let's format the output as requested.\n\nThe positions of the queens are:\n- (0, 0)\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 7)\n- (3, 5)\n- (4, 2)\n- (5, 6)\n- (6, 1)\n- (7, 3)\n\nThese positions ensure that no two queens can attack each other, and no queen is placed in the cell marked with 'X'.\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
