    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and we have constraints due to the 'X' marked cells where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with some queens already placed. We need to identify the positions of these queens and the 'X' marked cells.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens.\n   - We will start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in each column, checking if the position is valid (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not marked with 'X').\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will represent the board as a list of lists.\n   - We will use a recursive function to attempt to place queens row by row.\n   - We will keep track of columns, and diagonals that are already under attack.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\npositions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and return their positions.

    "The code provided did not correctly solve the problem because it only returned the positions of the queens that were already placed on the board. The backtracking algorithm did not correctly place the remaining queens.
