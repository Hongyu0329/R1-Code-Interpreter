  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X', which cannot be used for placing queens.\n\n2. **Check existing placements**: We need to ensure that any existing queens (marked with '1') are not in conflict with each other.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: We need to find positions for the remaining queens such that they do not conflict with each other or with any existing queens.\n\n4. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row, ensuring that each placement is valid.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens_positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    queens_positions = []\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, queens_positions)\n\n    return queens_positions\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board using a backtracking approach, respecting the constraints of the board. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
