  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X', which cannot be used. We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: We start with a board that has no queens placed yet. We will iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a valid position.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: For each position, we need to check if placing a queen there would result in a conflict with any other queen already placed. This includes checking the row, column, and both diagonals.\n\n4. **Backtracking Approach**: If we find a valid position for a queen, we place it and move to the next row. If we cannot place a queen in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, we output their positions.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\npositions = []\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, positions)\n\n# Convert positions to the required format\nresult = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions)\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "The code successfully executed and provided a solution for placing the queens on the board. The output indicates the positions of the queens in the format requested. Let's verify the solution:\n\n- The queens are placed at the following positions: (0,0), (1,6), (2,3), (3,5), (4,7), (5,1), (6,4), and (7,2).\n- Each queen is placed in a unique row and column.\n- No two queens share the same diagonal.\n- The positions marked with 'X' are not used for placing any queens.\n\nThe solution satisfies all the constraints of the problem, and the queens are placed such that no two queens can attack each other.\n\n<<<0 0, 1 6, 2 3, 3 5, 4 7, 5 1, 6 4, 7 2>>>"
