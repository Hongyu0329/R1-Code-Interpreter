    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X', which cannot be used for placing queens. We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: We start with an empty board and place queens one by one, ensuring that each placement does not violate the constraints.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. If we find a valid position for a queen in a row, we move to the next row. If we cannot place a queen in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each position, we need to check if placing a queen there would result in any conflicts with already placed queens or if the position is marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(len(board)):\n            for j in range(len(board[i])):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return []\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and return the positions of the queens if a solution is found. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
