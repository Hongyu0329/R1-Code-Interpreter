    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is partially filled, and we need to ensure that the queens are placed according to the rules of the N-Queens problem.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have an 8x8 board.\n2. Some queens are already placed, and we need to place the remaining queens.\n3. Queens cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n4. We need to find a valid configuration for the remaining queens.\n\nGiven the initial board configuration:\n\n```\nRow 0: 01000000\nRow 1: 00000000\nRow 2: 00000000\nRow 3: 00000010\nRow 4: 00000000\nRow 5: 00000001\nRow 6: 00000000\nRow 7: 00000000\n```\n\nWe can see that queens are already placed at positions (0,1), (3,7), and (5,7).\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the positions for the remaining queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, len(board), 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, col):\n    if col >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if is_safe(board, i, col):\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, col + 1):\n                return True\n            board[i][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(len(board)):\n            for j in range(len(board[i])):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return \"No solution\"\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and return their positions.

    "The output \"No solution\" indicates that the current setup of the board does not allow for a valid placement of all eight queens.
