    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is an 8x8 grid, and we have some constraints:\n\n1. A queen is already placed at position (1, 5) and (7, 0).\n2. We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n3. No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n4. Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's first represent the board with the given constraints and then use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n### Steps:\n1.

    "The code returned \"No solution found,\" which indicates that the current approach did not find a valid configuration for placing all eight queens.
