    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 grid with one cell marked as 'X' at position (4, 1). We need to place 8 queens on the board.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row.\n   - No two queens can be in the same column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen on the cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens.\n   - We will iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a valid column.\n   - We will check if placing a queen in a particular cell is valid by ensuring it does not conflict with already placed queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the positions of the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(len(board)):\n            for j in range(len(board)):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return []\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThe code will attempt to place the queens on the board and return their positions. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
