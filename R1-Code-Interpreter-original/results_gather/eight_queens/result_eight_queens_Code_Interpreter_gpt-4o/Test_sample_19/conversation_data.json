A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other, and no queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'. This is a variation of the classic N-Queens problem with additional constraints.\n\nLet's start by implementing a solution to find a valid configuration for the queens.
