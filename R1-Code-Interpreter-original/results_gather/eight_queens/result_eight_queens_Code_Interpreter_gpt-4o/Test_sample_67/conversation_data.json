  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n000X0000\n00000000\n01000000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given board:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 X 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nFrom the board, we can see that there is already a queen placed at position (7, 1). We need to place the remaining 7 queens.\n\nLet's use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the queens. We'll start by placing queens row by row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other.
