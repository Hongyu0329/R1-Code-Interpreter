A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nSince the board is initially empty, we can use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration.
