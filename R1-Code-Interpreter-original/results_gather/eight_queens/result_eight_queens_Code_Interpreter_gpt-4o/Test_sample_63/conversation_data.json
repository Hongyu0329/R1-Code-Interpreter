  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other, and no queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'. Since the board is initially empty, we can start placing queens from scratch while adhering to the constraints.\n\nLet's implement a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the queens. We'll keep track of the rows, columns, and diagonals that are already occupied by queens to ensure no two queens can attack each other. \n\nLet's proceed with the implementation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n, result):\n    # base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(n):\n        if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            result.append((i, col))\n\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens(n):\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    result = []\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n, result):\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\n    return result\n\n# Solve the 8-queens problem\nqueen_positions = solve_n_queens(8)\nqueen_positions\nassistant > The solution to the 8-queens problem, where no two queens can attack each other, is as follows:\n\n<<<0 0, 4 1, 7 2, 5 3, 2 4, 6 5, 1 6, 3 7>>>\n\nThis means the queens are placed at the positions (0,0), (4,1), (7,2), (5,3), (2,4), (6,5), (1,6), and (3,7) on the 8x8 board."
