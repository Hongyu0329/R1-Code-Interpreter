A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given board and then use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for placing the queens. We'll represent the board as a list of lists and use a recursive function to attempt placing queens in valid positions. \n\nHere's the initial board setup:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 X 0 0 0 0 0\n0 X 0 0 X 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 X 0\n```\n\nLet's implement the solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n, positions):\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':  # Skip cells marked with 'X'\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            positions.append((i, col))\n\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    positions = []\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n, positions):\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the N-Queens problem\nqueen_positions = solve_n_queens(board)\nqueen_positions\nassistant > The solution to the N-Queens problem on the given board is to place the queens at the following positions:\n\n<<<0 0, 4 1, 7 2, 5 3, 2 4, 6 5, 1 6, 3 7>>>\n\nThis configuration ensures that no two queens can attack each other, and no queens are placed in cells marked with 'X'."
