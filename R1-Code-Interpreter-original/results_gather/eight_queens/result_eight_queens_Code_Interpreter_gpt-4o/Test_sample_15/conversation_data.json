    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given board and then proceed to place the remaining queens. We'll use a backtracking approach to find a valid configuration.\n\nHere's the initial board:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 X 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 X 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nLet's proceed to find a solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n, restricted_positions):\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(n):\n        if (i, col) not in restricted_positions and is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 1\n\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n, restricted_positions):\n                return True\n\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 0\n\n    # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens(n, restricted_positions):\n    # Initialize the board\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Mark restricted positions\n    for r, c in restricted_positions:\n        board[r][c] = 'X'\n\n    # Solve the N-Queens problem\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n, restricted_positions):\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                queen_positions.append((i, j))\n\n    return queen_positions\n\n# Given board with restricted positions\nrestricted_positions = [(0, 4), (5, 2)]\nn = 8\n\n# Solve the problem\nqueen_positions = solve_n_queens(n, restricted_positions)\nqueen_positions\nassistant > The solution to the problem is to place the queens at the following positions:\n\n- Row 0, Column 0\n- Row 1, Column 6\n- Row 2, Column 4\n- Row 3, Column 7\n- Row 4, Column 1\n- Row 5, Column 3\n- Row 6, Column 5\n- Row 7, Column 2\n\nIn the required format, the solution is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 6, 2 4, 3 7, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 2>>>"
