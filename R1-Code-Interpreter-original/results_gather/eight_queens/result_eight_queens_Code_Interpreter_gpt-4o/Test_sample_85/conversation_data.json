  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given board and determine the positions of the already placed queens and the restricted cells:\n\n```\n0 X 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 X 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 X 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe queens are already placed at positions (0, 2).
