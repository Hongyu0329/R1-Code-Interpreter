    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given board and identifying the positions of the already placed queens and the restricted cells. Then, we'll use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the remaining queens.\n\nHere's the given board:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X\n0 0 X 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nX 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe queen is already placed at position (1, 3). The restricted cells are at positions (4, 7), (5, 2), and (7, 0).\n\nLet's implement the solution using a backtracking approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\r\n    # Check this row on left side\r\n    for i in range(col):\r\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\r\n            return False\r\n\r\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\r\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\r\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\r\n            return False\r\n\r\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\r\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\r\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\r\n            return False\r\n\r\n    return True\r\n\r\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n):\r\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\r\n    if col >= n:\r\n        return True\r\n\r\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':  # Skip restricted cells\r\n            continue\r\n        if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\r\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\r\n            board[i][col] = 1\r\n\r\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\r\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n):\r\n                return True\r\n\r\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\r\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\r\n            board[i][col] = 0\r\n\r\n    # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false\r\n    return False\r\n\r\ndef solve_n_queens(board, n):\r\n    if solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n) is False:\r\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\r\n    else:\r\n        # Collect the positions of the queens\r\n        queen_positions = []\r\n        for i in range(n):\r\n            for j in range(n):\r\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\r\n                    queen_positions.append((i, j))\r\n        return queen_positions\r\n\r\n# Initialize the board with the given configuration\r\nn = 8\r\nboard = [\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\r\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\r\n]\r\n\r\n# Solve the N-Queens problem\r\nqueen_positions = solve_n_queens(board, n)\r\nqueen_positions\nassistant > The solution to the N-Queens problem with the given constraints is as follows:\n\nQueens are placed at the positions:\n- (0, 6)\n- (1, 0)\n- (1, 3) (already placed)\n- (2, 2)\n- (3, 7)\n- (4, 5)\n- (5, 3)\n- (6, 1)\n- (7, 4)\n\nIn the required format, the positions are:\n<<<0 6, 1 0, 1 3, 2 2, 3 7, 4 5, 5 3, 6 1, 7 4>>>"
