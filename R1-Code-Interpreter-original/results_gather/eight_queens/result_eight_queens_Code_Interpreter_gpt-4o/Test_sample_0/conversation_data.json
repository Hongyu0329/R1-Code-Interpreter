A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's start by placing the queens on the board and ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. We'll use a backtracking approach to find a valid configuration. \n\nHere's the initial board configuration:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 X 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nLet's proceed with the solution.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n):\n    # Base case: If all queens are placed\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Consider this column and try placing this queen in all rows one by one\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':  # Skip cells marked with 'X'\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            # Place this queen in board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 1\n\n            # Recur to place rest of the queens\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n):\n                return True\n\n            # If placing queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution\n            # then remove queen from board[i][col]\n            board[i][col] = 0\n\n    # If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens(n):\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    # Mark the 'X' positions\n    board[2][4] = 'X'\n    board[3][7] = 'X'\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\n    \n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                queen_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    return queen_positions\n\n# Solve the 8-queens problem with the given constraints\nqueen_positions = solve_n_queens(8)\nqueen_positions\nassistant > The positions of the queens on the board, ensuring no two queens can attack each other and avoiding the cells marked with 'X', are as follows:\n\n- (0, 0)\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 3)\n- (3, 5)\n- (4, 7)\n- (5, 1)\n- (6, 4)\n- (7, 2)\n\nIn the required format, the solution is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 6, 2 3, 3 5, 4 7, 5 1, 6 4, 7 2>>>"
