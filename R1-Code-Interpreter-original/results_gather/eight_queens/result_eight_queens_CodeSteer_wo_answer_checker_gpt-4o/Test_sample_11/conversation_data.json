    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given board configuration and identify the positions where queens are already placed (if any).\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not marked with 'X' and is not under attack by any previously placed queens.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each attempted placement, check if the position is valid by ensuring no other queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Recursive Search**: If a valid position is found, move to the next row and repeat the process. If a row cannot accommodate a queen, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints. It outputs the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "Let's refine the solution to ensure that the constraints, especially the 'X' positions, are correctly handled. The `is_safe` function should not only check for existing queens but also ensure that no queen is placed in a cell marked with 'X'. Additionally, we need to ensure that the initial board setup accurately reflects any pre-placed queens or blocked positions.\n\nHere's the updated plan and code:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Define the board with '0' for empty cells, '1' for cells with queens, and 'X' for blocked cells.\n\n2. **Check Validity**: Update the `is_safe` function to ensure that a queen is not placed in a cell marked with 'X' and that no other queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a recursive function to place queens row by row, ensuring that each placement is valid.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the specified format.\n\nHere's the refined Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check if the position is blocked\n    if board[row][col] == 'X':\n        return False\n\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code ensures that queens are not placed in cells marked with 'X' and that no two queens can attack each other.

    "The current solution uses a backtracking approach, which is a suitable method for solving the N-Queens problem. However, ensure that the code correctly handles the constraints of the board, especially the 'X' positions where queens cannot be placed. Double-check the logic in the `is_safe` function to ensure it correctly identifies safe positions considering the 'X' constraints. Additionally, verify that the initial board setup accurately reflects any pre-placed queens or blocked positions.
