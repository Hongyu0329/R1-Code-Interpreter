  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We already have one queen placed at (0, 3) and a restricted cell at (1, 5) marked with 'X'. We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: We'll use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. For each row, we'll try placing a queen in each column, checking if it's a valid position (i.e., not under attack and not marked with 'X').\n\n3. **Check Validity**: For each attempted position, check if it's safe by ensuring no other queens are in the same column or diagonals.\n\n4. **Recursive Placement**: If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row=0):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    solve_n_queens(board)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all eight queens in the required format.",
    "Let's refine the code to ensure that it correctly places all queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
