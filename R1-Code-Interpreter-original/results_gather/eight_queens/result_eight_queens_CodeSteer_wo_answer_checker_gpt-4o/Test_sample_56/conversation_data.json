    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with one queen already placed at position (7, 7). We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n2. **Check Rows and Columns**: Since each row and column can only have one queen, we need to ensure that each row and column has exactly one queen.\n\n3. **Check Diagonals**: Ensure that no two queens share the same diagonal. Diagonals can be identified by the difference and sum of their row and column indices.\n\n4. **Avoid 'X' Positions**: Ensure that no queen is placed in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row, checking for conflicts at each step. If a conflict is found, backtrack and try a different position.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row=0):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef print_solution(board):\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board)):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{', '.join(positions)}>>>\")\n\n# Initialize the board\nboard = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\nboard[7][7] = 1  # Pre-placed queen\n\n# Solve the problem\nif solve_n_queens(board):\n    print_solution(board)\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code initializes the board, places the pre-existing queen, and uses a backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens. It then prints the positions of all queens in the required format.",
    "To incorporate the 'X' positions into the solution, we need to modify the board initialization to include these positions and adjust the logic to ensure queens are not placed in these cells. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board with 'X' Positions**: We need to set up the board with 'X' positions where queens cannot be placed.\n\n2. **Modify the Placement Check**: Update the `solve_n_queens` function to ensure that queens are not placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Ensure Safe Placement**: The `is_safe` function should remain the same, as it already checks for conflicts with other queens.\n\nLet's implement these changes in the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row=0):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef print_solution(board):\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board)):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{', '.join(positions)}>>>\")\n\n# Initialize the board with 'X' positions\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  # Pre-placed queen\n]\n\n# Example of marking 'X' positions (for demonstration, adjust as needed)\n# board[0][1] = 'X'\n# board[1][3] = 'X'\n# Add more 'X' positions as needed\n\n# Solve the problem\nif solve_n_queens(board):\n    print_solution(board)\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nIn this code, you can mark 'X' positions by setting `board[row][col] = 'X'` for the respective cells.
