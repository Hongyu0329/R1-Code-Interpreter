    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid initialized to 0, representing empty cells.\n\n2. **Place Initial Queens**: If there are any queens already placed on the board, mark those positions with 1.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens:\n   - Try to place a queen in each row.\n   - For each row, iterate over each column and check if placing a queen there is safe (i.e., no other queens in the same column, and no queens on the diagonals).\n   - If it's safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen leads to a solution, return the positions.\n   - If not, backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Check Safety**: Implement a function to check if a position is safe for placing a queen.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    positions = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "To incorporate the constraints of positions marked with 'X' and optimize the search process, we can enhance the backtracking algorithm by considering these constraints and using a more efficient search strategy. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board with Constraints**: Start with an 8x8 grid where 'X' marks the positions that are not allowed for placing queens. These positions should be initialized to a special value (e.g., -1) to indicate they are blocked.\n\n2. **Backtracking with Constraints**: Modify the backtracking algorithm to skip over the blocked positions marked with 'X'. This will ensure that queens are not placed in these positions.\n\n3. **Use Heuristics**: Implement a heuristic to choose the next column to place a queen. For example, we can prioritize columns with fewer available positions, which can help reduce the search space.\n\n4. **Constraint Propagation**: As we place each queen, update the board to mark the attacked positions (rows, columns, and diagonals) to avoid placing other queens in these positions.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nHere's the updated Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    # Get columns sorted by the number of available positions\n    available_cols = [col for col in range(len(board)) if board[row][col] == 0]\n    available_cols.sort(key=lambda col: sum(board[i][col] == 0 for i in range(row, len(board))))\n\n    for col in available_cols:\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    # Initialize the board with 0s and -1s for blocked positions\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Example of blocked positions (X)\n    blocked_positions = [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5)]  # Add actual blocked positions here\n    for r, c in blocked_positions:\n        board[r][c] = -1\n\n    positions = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code now considers blocked positions and uses a heuristic to optimize the search process. You can modify the `blocked_positions` list to include the actual positions marked with 'X' on your board."

    "The current solution uses a basic backtracking approach, which is a good start. However, it does not account for the constraints of positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed. To improve the solution, consider incorporating these constraints into the backtracking algorithm. Additionally, explore more efficient search techniques or optimizations, such as constraint propagation or heuristic-based search, to enhance the performance of the solution. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code that considers all constraints and optimizes the search process."
