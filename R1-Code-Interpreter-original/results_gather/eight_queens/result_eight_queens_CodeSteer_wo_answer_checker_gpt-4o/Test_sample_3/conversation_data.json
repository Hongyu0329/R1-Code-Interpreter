    "To solve this problem, we need to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid initialized to 0, representing empty cells.\n\n2. **Place Initial Queens**: If there are any queens already placed on the board, mark those positions with 1.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens:\n   - Try placing a queen in each row, one by one.\n   - For each row, try placing the queen in each column.\n   - Check if the current position is safe (i.e., no other queens in the same column, and no queens on the same diagonals).\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing the queen leads to a solution, return the positions.\n   - If not, backtrack and try the next position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    positions = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format. Note that this assumes no initial queens or 'X' positions are given, as the problem statement did not specify any. If there are initial constraints, they should be added to the board initialization.",
    "To incorporate initial constraints such as pre-placed queens and restricted 'X' positions, we need to modify the board initialization and ensure that the backtracking algorithm respects these constraints. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board with Constraints**: Start with an 8x8 grid where:\n   - '1' represents a pre-placed queen.\n   - 'X' represents a restricted position where no queen can be placed.\n   - '0' represents an empty cell where a queen can potentially be placed.\n\n2. **Modify the Backtracking Algorithm**: Ensure that the algorithm:\n   - Skips over cells marked with 'X'.\n   - Does not alter cells with pre-placed queens.\n\n3. **Handle No Solution Case**: If no valid configuration is found, output a message indicating that no solution exists.\n\nLet's implement these changes in the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens_with_constraints(initial_board):\n    board = [row[:] for row in initial_board]  # Copy the initial board\n    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(8) for c in range(8) if board[r][c] == 1]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\n# Example initial board with constraints\ninitial_board = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nplace_queens_with_constraints(initial_board)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `initial_board` can be modified to include pre-placed queens (marked as `1`) and restricted positions (marked as `'X'`).\n- The `solve_n_queens` function respects these constraints by only attempting to place queens in cells marked as `0`.\n- The solution is printed in the required format, or a message is displayed if no solution is possible."
