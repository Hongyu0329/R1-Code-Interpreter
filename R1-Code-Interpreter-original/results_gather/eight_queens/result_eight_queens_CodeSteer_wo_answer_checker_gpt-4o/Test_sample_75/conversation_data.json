    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We need to understand the current placement of queens and the restricted positions.\n\n2. **Track Used Rows, Columns, and Diagonals**: We will maintain sets to track which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other. If a valid position is found, move to the next row. If not, backtrack and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each potential position, check if the row, column, and both diagonals are free and not marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    def is_safe(row, col):\n        return (col not in cols and\n                (row - col) not in diag1 and\n                (row + col) not in diag2 and\n                board[row][col] != 'X')\n\n    def place_queens(row):\n        if row == 8:\n            return True\n        for col in range(8):\n            if is_safe(row, col):\n                board[row][col] = '1'\n                cols.add(col)\n                diag1.add(row - col)\n                diag2.add(row + col)\n                if place_queens(row + 1):\n                    return True\n                board[row][col] = '0'\n                cols.remove(col)\n                diag1.remove(row - col)\n                diag2.remove(row + col)\n        return False\n\n    # Initialize the board and sets\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n    queens_positions = []\n\n    # Mark existing queens and restricted positions\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                cols.add(c)\n                diag1.add(r - c)\n                diag2.add(r + c)\n\n    # Start placing queens from the first row\n    place_queens(0)\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                queens_positions.append(f\"{r} {c}\")\n\n    return f\"<<<{', '.join(queens_positions)}>>>\"\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'X'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\n# Get the solution\nsolution = solve_n_queens(board)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all eight queens in the required format, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other and avoiding the restricted positions.",
