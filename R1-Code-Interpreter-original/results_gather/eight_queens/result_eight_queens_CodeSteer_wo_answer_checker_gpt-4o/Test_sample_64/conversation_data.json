    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given 8x8 grid, marking the positions of the queens and the restricted cell.\n\n2. **Check Constraints**: Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. Also, avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row. If a valid position is found, move to the next row. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints. It outputs the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "Let's review the code to ensure it correctly handles the constraint of not placing queens in cells marked with 'X'. The `is_safe` function should be updated to account for this restriction, and we should ensure that the initial board setup reflects any pre-placed queens or restricted cells.\n\nHere's the revised plan and code:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given 8x8 grid, marking the positions of the restricted cell with 'X'. Ensure that the board is initialized with integers, where 'X' is represented by a special value (e.g., -1) to distinguish it from empty cells (0) and queen-occupied cells (1).\n\n2. **Check Constraints**: Update the `is_safe` function to ensure that no queen is placed in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row. If a valid position is found, move to the next row. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nHere's the updated Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check if the cell is restricted\n    if board[row][col] == -1:\n        return False\n\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 'X' is represented by -1\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code now correctly handles the 'X' restriction by representing it as -1 in the board and checking for it in the `is_safe` function.
