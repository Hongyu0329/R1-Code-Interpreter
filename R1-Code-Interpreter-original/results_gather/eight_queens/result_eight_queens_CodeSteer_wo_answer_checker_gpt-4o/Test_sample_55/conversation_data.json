    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with one cell marked as 'X' where a queen cannot be placed. We need to place 8 queens in total.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given board and identify the positions where queens are already placed (if any). In this case, the board is empty except for the 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. For each row, try placing a queen in each column, checking if the position is safe (i.e., not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queens and not on 'X').\n\n4. **Check Safety**: For each potential position, check if placing a queen there would result in a conflict with any previously placed queens.\n\n5. **Recursive Placement**: If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row. If not, backtrack and try the next column.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n    # Check if the column is safe\n    for r, c in queens:\n        if c == col or abs(r - row) == abs(c - col):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens):\n    if row == 8:\n        return queens\n    \n    for col in range(8):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            result = solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens)\n            if result:\n                return result\n            queens.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', 'X', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\n# Solve the problem\nqueens = solve_n_queens(board, 0, [])\nif queens:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to find a valid configuration for placing the queens on the board. It checks each position for safety and backtracks if a conflict is found, ultimately printing the positions of the queens in the required format."
