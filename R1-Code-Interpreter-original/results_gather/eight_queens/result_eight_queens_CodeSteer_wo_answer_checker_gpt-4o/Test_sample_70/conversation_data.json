    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We need to understand the current placement of queens and the restricted positions.\n\n2. **Track Constraints**: We need to track which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or restricted by 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in valid positions. If a position is valid, place a queen and move to the next row. If not, backtrack and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each position, check if placing a queen there would violate any constraints (same row, column, or diagonal).\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check if the column is safe\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the upper left diagonal\n    i, j = row, col\n    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n        i -= 1\n        j -= 1\n\n    # Check the upper right diagonal\n    i, j = row, col\n    while i >= 0 and j < n:\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n        i -= 1\n        j += 1\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row == n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X' or board[row][col] == 1:\n            continue\n        if is_valid(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        ['0', '0', 'X', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'X', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n        ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    positions = []\n\n    # Add existing queens to positions\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == '1':\n                positions.append((i, j))\n\n    # Start solving from the first row\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions)\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions)\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all queens on the board in the required format.",
