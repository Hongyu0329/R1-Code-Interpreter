    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We already have one queen placed at position (4, 5). We also have a restricted cell at position (5, 5) marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initialize the Board**: Create an 8x8 board to represent the current state, with '1' for the queen, '0' for empty cells, and 'X' for restricted cells.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens:\n   - Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in each column.\n   - For each placement, check if the position is safe (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not restricted).\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen in a row is not possible, backtrack to the previous row and try the next column.\n\n4. **Check Safety**: Implement a function to check if a queen can be placed at a given position by ensuring no other queens are in the same column, or on the same diagonal.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(4, 5)]\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all eight queens in the required format.",
    "To address the issues with the initial solution, we need to ensure that the backtracking algorithm respects the constraints of the pre-placed queen and the restricted cell. We should start the search from the row after the pre-placed queen and ensure that we do not attempt to place queens in restricted cells or columns that are already occupied.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Create an 8x8 board with the pre-placed queen and the restricted cell.\n\n2. **Track Occupied Columns**: Maintain a list to track which columns are already occupied by queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Start the search from the first row, but skip the row with the pre-placed queen. For each row, attempt to place a queen in each column that is not occupied or restricted.\n\n4. **Check Safety**: Implement a function to check if a queen can be placed at a given position by ensuring no other queens are in the same column or on the same diagonal.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement the revised solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, occupied_columns):\n    # Check if the column is already occupied\n    if col in occupied_columns:\n        return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions, occupied_columns):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    # Skip the row with the pre-placed queen\n    if row == 4:\n        return solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions, occupied_columns)\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, occupied_columns):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            occupied_columns.add(col)\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions, occupied_columns):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n            occupied_columns.remove(col)\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(4, 5)]\n    occupied_columns = {5}  # Column 5 is occupied by the pre-placed queen\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions, occupied_columns):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will correctly place the remaining queens while respecting the constraints of the pre-placed queen and the restricted cell."

    "The current solution uses a backtracking approach, which is a systematic search method suitable for solving the N-Queens problem. However, the code does not account for the pre-placed queen and the restricted cell marked with 'X' effectively.
