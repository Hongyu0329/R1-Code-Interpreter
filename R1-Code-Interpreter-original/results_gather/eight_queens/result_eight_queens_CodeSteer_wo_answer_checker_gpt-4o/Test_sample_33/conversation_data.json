    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. We also need to respect the positions marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We need to understand the current placement of queens and the positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Track Constraints**: We need to track which rows, columns, and diagonals are already under attack by existing queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in valid positions. If a position is valid (not under attack and not marked with 'X'), place a queen and move to the next row. If a row cannot accommodate a queen, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    result = [(0, 4), (4, 3)]  # Initial positions of queens\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result)\n\n    # Format the result\n    formatted_result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in result)\n    print(f'<<<{formatted_result}>>>')\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output the positions in the required format.",
