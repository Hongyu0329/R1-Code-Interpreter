  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: Parse the given board to identify the positions of the already placed queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing the remaining queens on the board. This involves:\n   - Trying to place a queen in each row, ensuring it doesn't conflict with existing queens in terms of columns and diagonals.\n   - Skipping positions marked with 'X'.\n   - Recursively attempting to place queens in subsequent rows.\n   - Backtracking if a conflict arises, i.e., if a queen cannot be placed in a valid position in a row.\n\n3. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens on the board.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X' or board[row][col] == 1:\n            continue\n\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all queens on the board in the required format.",

It uses the `is_safe` function to ensure no conflicts with existing queens.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking**: If a queen is successfully placed, the algorithm proceeds to the next row.
