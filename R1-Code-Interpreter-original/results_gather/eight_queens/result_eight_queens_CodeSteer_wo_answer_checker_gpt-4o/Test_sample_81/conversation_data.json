    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place a total of 8 queens on the board.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start by identifying the positions of any pre-placed queens (marked with '1') and the restricted positions (marked with 'X').\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens. This involves:\n   - Trying to place a queen in each row.\n   - Ensuring that the column and both diagonals (left and right) are not under attack.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    result = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output their positions in the specified format.",
    "Certainly! Let's refine the solution to ensure that the constraints, especially the positions marked with 'X', are correctly handled. We'll make sure that the `is_safe` function checks for these restricted positions and that the board setup accurately reflects the initial conditions.\n\nHere's the updated code with additional comments and checks:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check if the current column has a queen\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper left diagonal\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper right diagonal\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check if the current position is restricted\n    if board[row][col] == 'X':\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        # Check if the position is safe and not restricted\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    result = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Restricted Positions**: The `is_safe` function now explicitly checks if the current position is marked with 'X' and returns `False` if it is.\n- **Initial Board Setup**: The board is initialized with '0' for empty cells and 'X' for restricted cells. This setup is crucial for ensuring that queens are not placed in restricted positions.\n- **Backtracking**: The algorithm uses backtracking to explore possible placements of queens, ensuring that each placement is valid according to the rules of the N-Queens problem and the additional constraints.\n\nThis code should correctly handle the constraints and find a valid solution if one exists."
