    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given board and identify the positions where queens are already placed (if any).\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not under attack by another queen and is not marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each attempted placement, check if the position is valid (i.e., not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queen).\n\n5. **Recursive Search**: If a valid position is found, move to the next row and repeat the process. If a row cannot be completed, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n):\n        result = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        print(f\"<<<{', '.join(result)}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "Let's refine the solution to ensure it correctly handles the constraints, such as avoiding cells marked with 'X', and places exactly eight queens on the board. The backtracking approach will be adjusted to account for these constraints more explicitly.\n\nHere's the refined plan:\n\n1. **Board Initialization**: Initialize the board with 0s for empty cells and -1 for cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Backtracking Function**: Implement a backtracking function that attempts to place a queen in each row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other and that no queen is placed in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Safety Check**: Modify the safety check to ensure that queens are not placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Recursive Search**: Use recursion to attempt placing queens row by row. If a valid configuration is found, return the solution.\n\n5. **Output**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of the queens.\n\nHere's the refined Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n):\n        result = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        print(f\"<<<{', '.join(result)}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code ensures that queens are not placed in cells marked with 'X' and that exactly eight queens are placed on the board. The `is_safe` function checks for conflicts in columns and diagonals, and the backtracking function attempts to place queens row by row. The solution is printed in the required format once a valid configuration is found."
