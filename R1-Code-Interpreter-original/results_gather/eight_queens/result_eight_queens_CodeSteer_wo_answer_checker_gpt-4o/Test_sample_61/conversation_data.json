    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place a total of 8 queens, and no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start by reading the board and identifying the positions where queens are already placed (marked with '1') and the positions that are blocked (marked with 'X').\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens. This involves:\n   - Trying to place a queen in each row.\n   - Checking if the current position is safe (i.e., not in the same column, row, or diagonal as another queen and not marked with 'X').\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen leads to a dead end, backtrack and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "To optimize the backtracking approach for the N-Queens problem, we can incorporate constraint propagation techniques. One effective way to do this is by using sets to keep track of columns and diagonals that are already under attack by queens. This reduces the need to check every cell repeatedly, thus improving efficiency.\n\nHere's how we can enhance the code:\n\n1. **Use Sets for Constraints**: Maintain sets for columns, and both diagonals (major and minor) to quickly check if a position is under attack.\n\n2. **Skip 'X' Positions**: Ensure that positions marked with 'X' are skipped during the placement of queens.\n\n3. **Efficient Backtracking**: Use the sets to prune the search space by avoiding positions that are already under attack.\n\nLet's implement these optimizations in the code:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens_optimized(board, row, n, cols, diag1, diag2, result):\n    if row == n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == -1:  # Skip 'X' positions\n            continue\n        if col in cols or (row - col) in diag1 or (row + col) in diag2:\n            continue\n\n        # Place the queen\n        board[row][col] = 1\n        cols.add(col)\n        diag1.add(row - col)\n        diag2.add(row + col)\n        result.append((row, col))\n\n        if solve_n_queens_optimized(board, row + 1, n, cols, diag1, diag2, result):\n            return True\n\n        # Backtrack\n        board[row][col] = 0\n        cols.remove(col)\n        diag1.remove(row - col)\n        diag2.remove(row + col)\n        result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens_optimized():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n\n    if solve_n_queens_optimized(board, 0, n, cols, diag1, diag2, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens_optimized()\n```\n\nIn this optimized version, we use sets to track the columns and diagonals that are under attack, which allows us to quickly determine if a position is safe for placing a queen. This reduces the number of checks needed and speeds up the backtracking process. Additionally, we ensure that positions marked with 'X' are skipped during the search."

    "The current solution uses a backtracking approach, which is a systematic search method suitable for solving the N-Queens problem. However, the complexity score suggests that the code could be improved by incorporating more efficient searching techniques or symbolic computing to handle constraints more delicately. Consider optimizing the backtracking algorithm by implementing constraint propagation or using advanced data structures to reduce the search space. Additionally, ensure that the solution correctly handles the constraints imposed by the 'X' positions. Try to enhance the code with these considerations in mind."
