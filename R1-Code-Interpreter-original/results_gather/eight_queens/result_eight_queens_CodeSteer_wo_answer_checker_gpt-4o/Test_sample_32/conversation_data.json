  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - Some positions are already occupied by queens (marked with '1').\n   - Some positions are blocked (marked with 'X').\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Create a representation of the board using a list of lists.\n   - Mark the positions of existing queens and blocked cells.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**:\n   - Use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not blocked and does not result in a conflict with existing queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row.\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same column.\n   - Ensure no two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable value\nfor i in range(8):\n    for j in range(8):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
