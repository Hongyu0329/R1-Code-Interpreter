  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We need to understand the current placement of queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Track Occupied Rows, Columns, and Diagonals**: We will maintain sets to track which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking**: Use a recursive backtracking approach to try placing queens in each row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other. If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    def is_safe(row, col):\n        return (col not in cols and\n                (row - col) not in diag1 and\n                (row + col) not in diag2 and\n                board[row][col] != 'X')\n\n    def place_queens(row):\n        if row == 8:\n            return True\n        for col in range(8):\n            if is_safe(row, col):\n                board[row][col] = '1'\n                cols.add(col)\n                diag1.add(row - col)\n                diag2.add(row + col)\n                if place_queens(row + 1):\n                    return True\n                board[row][col] = '0'\n                cols.remove(col)\n                diag1.remove(row - col)\n                diag2.remove(row + col)\n        return False\n\n    # Initialize the board and sets\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n    queens_positions = []\n\n    # Mark existing queens and restricted positions\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                cols.add(c)\n                diag1.add(r - c)\n                diag2.add(r + c)\n\n    # Start placing queens from the first row\n    place_queens(0)\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                queens_positions.append(f\"{r} {c}\")\n\n    return f\"<<<{', '.join(queens_positions)}>>>\"\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', 'X', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\n# Solve the problem and print the result\nprint(solve_n_queens(board))\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format once the solution is found.",
