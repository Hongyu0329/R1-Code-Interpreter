    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place 8 queens in total.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start with an empty board and mark the positions where queens cannot be placed due to 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens one by one in each row. For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not already attacked by another queen or marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each attempted placement, check if the position is valid (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not marked with 'X').\n\n5. **Recursive Placement**: If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(8):\n    for j in range(8):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "Let's review and refine the solution to ensure it correctly handles the constraints, especially avoiding cells marked with 'X'. We'll ensure that the logic for marking and checking these cells is robust and that no queens are placed in invalid positions. Here's the refined approach:\n\n1. **Marking Non-Placeable Cells**: We'll use a specific marker (e.g., `-1`) to indicate cells where queens cannot be placed due to 'X'.\n\n2. **Checking Validity**: When checking if a position is safe for placing a queen, we'll ensure that the position is not marked with `-1` and is not attacked by any other queen.\n\n3. **Backtracking with Constraints**: We'll use a backtracking approach to place queens row by row, ensuring that each placement adheres to the constraints.\n\nHere's the refined Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, -1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Non-Placeable Marker**: We use `-1` to mark cells where queens cannot be placed due to 'X'.\n- **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function ensures that a queen is not placed in a column, left diagonal, or right diagonal that is already attacked by another queen.\n- **Backtracking**: The `solve_n_queens` function uses backtracking to find a valid configuration of queens on the board.\n\nThis code should correctly handle the constraints and provide a valid solution for placing the queens."
