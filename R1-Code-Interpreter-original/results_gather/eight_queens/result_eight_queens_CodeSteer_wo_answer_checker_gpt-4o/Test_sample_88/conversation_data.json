  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. We also need to respect the positions marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed. We need to identify the positions of these queens.\n\n2. **Determine the Constraints**: \n   - Queens cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal as another queen.\n   - Queens cannot be placed in positions marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not already attacked by another queen or marked with 'X'.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row.\n   - If a row cannot be completed, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Initial board setup\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach and print the positions of all queens in the required format.",
    "To incorporate the constraint of positions marked with 'X', we need to modify the board setup to include these positions and ensure that the algorithm does not place queens in these cells. We can represent 'X' positions with a special marker, such as `-1`, to indicate that a queen cannot be placed there.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Initial board setup with 'X' positions marked as -1\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Example of marking 'X' positions (for demonstration, adjust as needed)\n    # board[0][1] = -1  # Example of marking a position with 'X'\n    # board[2][3] = -1  # Another example\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nIn this code, you can mark any position with `-1` to indicate that a queen cannot be placed there. The `solve_n_queens` function checks for `0` before attempting to place a queen, ensuring that queens are not placed in positions marked with `-1`. Adjust the board setup to include any specific 'X' positions as needed.",
    "To dynamically handle the constraints based on input, we can modify the code to accept a board configuration that includes 'X' positions. We'll represent 'X' positions with `-1` in the board. Additionally, we can optimize the backtracking approach by using a heuristic to choose the next column to place a queen, such as selecting the column with the fewest conflicts.\n\nHere's the enhanced code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    # Heuristic: Try columns with fewer constraints first\n    columns = sorted(range(n), key=lambda c: sum(board[r][c] == 1 for r in range(n)))\n\n    for col in columns:\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Input board configuration with 'X' positions marked as -1\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Example of marking 'X' positions (adjust as needed)\n    # board[0][1] = -1  # Example of marking a position with 'X'\n    # board[2][3] = -1  # Another example\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Key Enhancements:\n1. **Dynamic Input Handling**: The board can be configured with `-1` to represent 'X' positions, which are dynamically respected during execution.\n\n2. **Heuristic Optimization**: The code uses a heuristic to sort columns based on the number of constraints, attempting to place queens in columns with fewer conflicts first. This can help reduce the search space and improve efficiency.\n\n3. **Flexibility**: The board setup can be easily modified to include any specific 'X' positions as needed."
