    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given board configuration and identify the positions of any pre-placed queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not under attack by another queen and is not marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each attempted placement, check if the position is valid (i.e., not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queen).\n\n5. **Recursive Search**: If a valid position is found, move to the next row and repeat the process. If a row cannot be completed, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n    # Check if the column is safe\n    for r in range(row):\n        if board[r][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the upper left diagonal\n    for r, c in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[r][c] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the upper right diagonal\n    for r, c in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[r][c] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    queens = []\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, queens)\n    print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens) + \">>>\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output their positions in the required format.",
    "To optimize the solution for the N-Queens problem with additional constraints (positions marked with 'X'), we can incorporate constraint propagation and use more efficient data structures to reduce the search space. Here's how we can enhance the code:\n\n1. **Use Sets for Constraints**: Maintain sets to track columns and diagonals that are already under attack by queens. This allows for constant-time checks to see if a position is safe.\n\n2. **Skip 'X' Positions**: Directly skip positions marked with 'X' during the search to avoid unnecessary checks.\n\n3. **Constraint Propagation**: As soon as a queen is placed, update the sets for columns and diagonals to reflect the new constraints.\n\n4. **Early Termination**: If a row cannot be completed due to constraints, backtrack immediately.\n\nLet's implement these optimizations in the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(row, col, cols, diag1, diag2):\n    return col not in cols and (row - col) not in diag1 and (row + col) not in diag2\n\ndef solve_n_queens_optimized(board, row, queens, cols, diag1, diag2):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(row, col, cols, diag1, diag2):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            cols.add(col)\n            diag1.add(row - col)\n            diag2.add(row + col)\n\n            if solve_n_queens_optimized(board, row + 1, queens, cols, diag1, diag2):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens.pop()\n            cols.remove(col)\n            diag1.remove(row - col)\n            diag2.remove(row + col)\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens_optimized():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    queens = []\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n\n    solve_n_queens_optimized(board, 0, queens, cols, diag1, diag2)\n    print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens) + \">>>\")\n\nplace_queens_optimized()\n```\n\nThis optimized code uses sets to efficiently track columns and diagonals under attack, skips 'X' positions, and updates constraints dynamically. This should reduce the search space and improve the performance of the solution."

    "The current solution uses a backtracking approach, which is a systematic search method suitable for solving the N-Queens problem. However, the complexity score suggests that the code could be improved by incorporating more efficient searching techniques or optimizations. Consider implementing optimizations such as constraint propagation or using more advanced data structures to reduce the search space. Additionally, ensure that the code correctly handles the constraints imposed by the 'X' positions on the board. Try to enhance the code with these considerations in mind."
