    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some cells marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given board and identify the positions where queens are already placed (if any).\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row:\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not marked with 'X' and is not under attack by any previously placed queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position for the queen there.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each attempted position, ensure that no other queen is in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "Let's review the code to ensure it correctly handles the constraints, particularly the cells marked with 'X', and that it places all eight queens without conflicts.\n\n1. **Handling 'X' Cells**: The code converts 'X' to `-1` to mark non-placeable cells. This is done correctly in the initial setup of the board.\n\n2. **Checking Validity**: The `is_safe` function checks if a queen can be placed at a given position by ensuring no other queens are in the same column or diagonals. This function should also ensure that the cell is not marked as `-1`.\n\n3. **Backtracking Logic**: The `solve_n_queens` function attempts to place queens row by row, using the `is_safe` function to verify each position.\n\nLet's refine the code to ensure it respects the constraints and correctly places all eight queens:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check if the cell is not marked as non-placeable\n    if board[row][col] == -1:\n        return False\n\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should correctly handle the constraints and place all eight queens on the board, avoiding cells marked with 'X' and ensuring no two queens can attack each other. If there are any issues, consider adding print statements to debug the board state at each step."

    "The current solution uses a backtracking approach, which is a suitable method for solving the N-Queens problem. However, ensure that the code correctly handles the constraints of the problem, particularly the cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed. Double-check the logic for marking these cells as non-placeable and ensure that the solution respects these constraints.
