    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid initialized with zeros, representing empty cells.\n\n2. **Place Queens**: Use a backtracking algorithm to place queens on the board. The algorithm will:\n   - Try to place a queen in each row.\n   - Check if the current position is safe (i.e., no other queens in the same column, and no queens on the diagonals).\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen leads to a solution, return the positions.\n   - If not, backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\n3. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    positions = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format. Note that this solution assumes there are no 'X' marks on the board, as none were provided in the initial grid. If there were 'X' marks, the `is_safe` function would need to be adjusted to account for those positions.",
    "To incorporate the 'X' marks into the solution, we need to modify the `is_safe` function to ensure that queens are not placed in cells marked with 'X'. Additionally, we should initialize the board with any pre-placed queens or 'X' marks if provided.\n\nHere's how we can modify the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid, and populate it with any pre-placed queens (marked with '1') and forbidden positions (marked with 'X').\n\n2. **Modify the `is_safe` Function**: Ensure that the function checks for 'X' marks and does not allow placing queens in those positions.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use the modified `is_safe` function to place queens on the board.\n\nLet's implement these changes in the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check if the position is marked with 'X'\n    if board[row][col] == 'X':\n        return False\n\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    # Initialize the board with '0' for empty, '1' for queens, and 'X' for forbidden positions\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code now checks for 'X' marks and ensures that queens are not placed in those positions. The board is initialized with zeros, but you can modify it to include any pre-placed queens or 'X' marks as needed.",
    "To make the solution more flexible and handle dynamic input for the initial board setup, we can modify the code to accept a board configuration as input. This configuration will include any pre-placed queens (marked with '1') and forbidden positions (marked with 'X'). The solution will then start the backtracking process from the first empty row.\n\nHere's how we can implement these changes:\n\n1. **Dynamic Board Input**: Allow the user to input the initial board configuration, which includes '0' for empty cells, '1' for pre-placed queens, and 'X' for forbidden positions.\n\n2. **Determine Starting Row**: Identify the first empty row to start the backtracking process, skipping any rows that already have queens placed.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use the modified `is_safe` function to place the remaining queens on the board.\n\nLet's implement these changes in the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check if the position is marked with 'X'\n    if board[row][col] == 'X':\n        return False\n\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens(initial_board):\n    board = [list(row) for row in initial_board]\n    positions = []\n\n    # Add pre-placed queens to positions\n    for r in range(len(board)):\n        for c in range(len(board[r])):\n            if board[r][c] == 1:\n                positions.append((r, c))\n\n    # Find the first empty row to start placing queens\n    start_row = next((r for r in range(len(board)) if 1 not in board[r]), 0)\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, start_row, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\n# Example initial board setup\ninitial_board = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nplace_queens(initial_board)\n```\n\nThis code allows for a dynamic initial board setup, making it more flexible for different scenarios.
