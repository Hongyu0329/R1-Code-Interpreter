    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the positions marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - Some positions are already occupied by queens (marked with '1').\n   - Some positions are blocked (marked with 'X').\n\n2. **Track Occupied Rows, Columns, and Diagonals**:\n   - Use sets to keep track of occupied rows, columns, and diagonals (both major and minor diagonals).\n\n3. **Place Remaining Queens**:\n   - Iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a column that is not occupied and not blocked by 'X'.\n   - Ensure that placing a queen does not conflict with existing queens in terms of row, column, or diagonal.\n\n4. **Output the Positions**:\n   - Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_queens(board):\n    n = 8\n    queens = []\n    occupied_cols = set()\n    occupied_major_diags = set()\n    occupied_minor_diags = set()\n\n    # Mark already placed queens and blocked positions\n    for r in range(n):\n        for c in range(n):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                queens.append((r, c))\n                occupied_cols.add(c)\n                occupied_major_diags.add(r - c)\n                occupied_minor_diags.add(r + c)\n            elif board[r][c] == 'X':\n                occupied_cols.add(c)\n                occupied_major_diags.add(r - c)\n                occupied_minor_diags.add(r + c)\n\n    # Function to check if a position is safe\n    def is_safe(r, c):\n        return (c not in occupied_cols and\n                (r - c) not in occupied_major_diags and\n                (r + c) not in occupied_minor_diags and\n                board[r][c] != 'X')\n\n    # Try to place queens in each row\n    for r in range(n):\n        if any(q[0] == r for q in queens):\n            continue  # Skip rows with already placed queens\n        for c in range(n):\n            if is_safe(r, c):\n                queens.append((r, c))\n                occupied_cols.add(c)\n                occupied_major_diags.add(r - c)\n                occupied_minor_diags.add(r + c)\n                break\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in sorted(queens))\n    return f'<<<{result}>>>'\n\n# Define the board\nboard = [\n    \"00000000\",\n    \"00010000\",\n    \"00000000\",\n    \"00000000\",\n    \"0000000X\",\n    \"00X00000\",\n    \"00000000\",\n    \"X0000000\"\n]\n\n# Solve and print the result\nprint(solve_queens(board))\n```\n\nThis code will place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output their positions in the required format.",
    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the board, we can use a backtracking algorithm. This approach will systematically explore all possible placements of queens while respecting the constraints of the problem.
