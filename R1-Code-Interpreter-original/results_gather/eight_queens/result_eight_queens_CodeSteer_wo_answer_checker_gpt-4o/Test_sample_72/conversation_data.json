  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as not placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Some positions are already occupied by queens (marked with '1').\n   - Some positions are blocked (marked with 'X').\n\n2. **Track Occupied Rows, Columns, and Diagonals**:\n   - Use sets to keep track of which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to try placing queens in each row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not blocked and not under attack.\n   - If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If a row cannot be completed, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    def is_safe(row, col):\n        return (col not in cols and\n                (row - col) not in diag1 and\n                (row + col) not in diag2 and\n                board[row][col] != 'X')\n\n    def place_queens(row):\n        if row == 8:\n            return True\n        for col in range(8):\n            if is_safe(row, col):\n                board[row][col] = '1'\n                cols.add(col)\n                diag1.add(row - col)\n                diag2.add(row + col)\n                if place_queens(row + 1):\n                    return True\n                board[row][col] = '0'\n                cols.remove(col)\n                diag1.remove(row - col)\n                diag2.remove(row + col)\n        return False\n\n    # Initialize board and constraints\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                cols.add(c)\n                diag1.add(r - c)\n                diag2.add(r + c)\n\n    # Start placing queens from the first row\n    place_queens(0)\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                queen_positions.append(f\"{r} {c}\")\n\n    return f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\"\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'X', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', 'X', 'X', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\n# Solve the problem and print the result\nprint(solve_n_queens(board))\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the board, we need to ensure that the backtracking algorithm effectively handles all constraints, including blocked positions and existing queens.
