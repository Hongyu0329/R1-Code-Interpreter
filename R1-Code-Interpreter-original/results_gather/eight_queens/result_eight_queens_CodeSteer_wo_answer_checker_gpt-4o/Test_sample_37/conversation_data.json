    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the positions marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - Some positions are already occupied by queens (marked with '1').\n   - Some positions are blocked (marked with 'X').\n\n2. **Track Occupied Rows, Columns, and Diagonals**:\n   - Use sets to keep track of which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to try placing queens in each row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not blocked and not under attack.\n   - If a valid position is found, mark the row, column, and diagonals as occupied and move to the next row.\n   - If a solution is found, return the positions of the queens.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Format the solution as a list of queen positions.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    def is_safe(row, col):\n        return (col not in cols and\n                (row - col) not in diag1 and\n                (row + col) not in diag2 and\n                board[row][col] != 'X')\n\n    def place_queens(row):\n        if row == 8:\n            return True\n        for col in range(8):\n            if is_safe(row, col):\n                board[row][col] = '1'\n                cols.add(col)\n                diag1.add(row - col)\n                diag2.add(row + col)\n                if place_queens(row + 1):\n                    return True\n                board[row][col] = '0'\n                cols.remove(col)\n                diag1.remove(row - col)\n                diag2.remove(row + col)\n        return False\n\n    # Initialize the board and constraints\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                cols.add(c)\n                diag1.add(r - c)\n                diag2.add(r + c)\n\n    # Start placing queens from the first row\n    place_queens(0)\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                queen_positions.append(f\"{r} {c}\")\n\n    return f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\"\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', 'X', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', 'X', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', 'X', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\n# Solve the problem and print the result\nprint(solve_n_queens(board))\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
