    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect any constraints given by cells marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid initialized to 0, representing empty cells.\n\n2. **Place Initial Queens**: If there are any queens already placed (marked with 1), note their positions.\n\n3. **Mark Forbidden Cells**: If there are any cells marked with 'X', note these positions as forbidden.\n\n4. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens:\n   - Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in each column.\n   - For each placement, check if the position is safe (i.e., not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen, and not in a forbidden cell).\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen in a row is not possible, backtrack to the previous row and try the next column.\n   - Continue this process until all queens are placed.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Example of forbidden cells (X) - adjust as needed\n    forbidden_cells = []  # Add tuples of (row, col) for forbidden cells\n\n    for row, col in forbidden_cells:\n        board[row][col] = 'X'\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n):\n        result = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        print(f\"<<<{', '.join(result)}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output their positions in the required format. Adjust the `forbidden_cells` list to include any cells marked with 'X' as needed.",
    "To address the problem with pre-placed queens and forbidden cells, we need to modify the initial setup of the board and ensure that our backtracking algorithm respects these constraints. Here's how we can enhance the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid initialized to 0, representing empty cells.\n\n2. **Place Initial Queens and Forbidden Cells**: Update the board with any pre-placed queens (marked with 1) and forbidden cells (marked with 'X').\n\n3. **Modify the Safety Check**: Ensure that the safety check accounts for forbidden cells and pre-placed queens.\n\n4. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use the backtracking approach to place the remaining queens, ensuring that no queens are placed in forbidden cells or in positions that would be attacked by pre-placed queens.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Example of pre-placed queens and forbidden cells\n    pre_placed_queens = [(0, 0), (1, 2)]  # Add tuples of (row, col) for pre-placed queens\n    forbidden_cells = [(2, 3), (4, 5)]  # Add tuples of (row, col) for forbidden cells\n\n    for row, col in pre_placed_queens:\n        board[row][col] = 1\n\n    for row, col in forbidden_cells:\n        board[row][col] = 'X'\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n):\n        result = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        print(f\"<<<{', '.join(result)}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nIn this code, you can adjust the `pre_placed_queens` and `forbidden_cells` lists to reflect the initial state of the board.
