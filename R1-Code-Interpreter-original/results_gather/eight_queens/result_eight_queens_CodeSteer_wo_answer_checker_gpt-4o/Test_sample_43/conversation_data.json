A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the cells marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Some cells are marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens, ensuring no two queens can attack each other.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Parse the board to identify the positions of existing queens and 'X' marks.\n   - Track which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**:\n   - Use a backtracking approach to try placing queens in each row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not already occupied or marked with 'X'.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row.\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    # Mark existing queens\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                result.append((i, j))\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, result):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output their positions in the specified format.",
