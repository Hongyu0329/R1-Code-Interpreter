    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: Parse the given board to identify the positions of the already placed queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens on the board. This involves:\n   - Trying to place a queen in each row.\n   - Checking if the position is safe (i.e., not in the same column, row, or diagonal as another queen and not marked with 'X').\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen leads to a solution, return the solution.\n   - If not, backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\n3. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 'X', 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    positions = []\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    # Start solving from the first row\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "To enhance the efficiency of the N-Queens solution, we can use additional data structures to track the availability of rows, columns, and diagonals. This will help us quickly determine if a position is safe for placing a queen. Here's how we can optimize the solution:\n\n1. **Use Sets for Tracking**: We can use sets to keep track of the columns and diagonals that are already occupied by queens. This allows us to check the safety of a position in constant time.\n\n2. **Constraint Propagation**: By immediately marking the columns and diagonals as occupied when placing a queen, we reduce the number of checks needed for subsequent placements.\n\n3. **Account for 'X' Positions**: Ensure that positions marked with 'X' are never considered for placing a queen.\n\nLet's implement these optimizations in the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(row, col, cols, diag1, diag2, board):\n    # Check if the position is not blocked by 'X' and is not under attack\n    return (col not in cols and\n            (row - col) not in diag1 and\n            (row + col) not in diag2 and\n            board[row][col] != -1)\n\ndef solve_n_queens_optimized(board, row, n, positions, cols, diag1, diag2):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if is_safe(row, col, cols, diag1, diag2, board):\n            # Place the queen\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            cols.add(col)\n            diag1.add(row - col)\n            diag2.add(row + col)\n\n            if solve_n_queens_optimized(board, row + 1, n, positions, cols, diag1, diag2):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n            cols.remove(col)\n            diag1.remove(row - col)\n            diag2.remove(row + col)\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens_optimized():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 'X', 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    positions = []\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    # Sets to track columns and diagonals\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n\n    # Start solving from the first row\n    if solve_n_queens_optimized(board, 0, n, positions, cols, diag1, diag2):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens_optimized()\n```\n\nThis optimized solution uses sets to efficiently track the columns and diagonals that are occupied, allowing for faster checks and reducing the overall complexity of the solution. The code also respects the 'X' constraints, ensuring that no queen is placed in restricted positions."
