    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the cells marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - Queens cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Parse the given board to identify the positions of already placed queens and the restricted cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not already occupied or restricted.\n   - Check if placing a queen in a particular cell is valid by ensuring it does not conflict with any previously placed queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row and repeat the process.\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n    # Check if the column is safe\n    for r in range(row):\n        if board[r][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the upper left diagonal\n    for r, c in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[r][c] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the upper right diagonal\n    for r, c in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[r][c] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, queens):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens_on_board():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X']\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for r in range(len(board)):\n        for c in range(len(board[r])):\n            if board[r][c] == 'X':\n                board[r][c] = -1\n\n    queens = []\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, queens)\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens)\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nplace_queens_on_board()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output their positions in the specified format.",
    "Let's review the code to ensure it correctly handles the constraints, including the restricted 'X' positions, and accurately reflects the initial board setup. I'll make sure the `is_safe` function accounts for these restrictions and verify the initial board setup.\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup**: Ensure that the board correctly represents the given problem, including any pre-placed queens and restricted 'X' positions.\n\n2. **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function should ensure that a queen is not placed in a column, row, or diagonal that is already occupied by another queen or marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Logic**: Ensure that the backtracking logic correctly places queens and respects the constraints.\n\nLet's refine the code to address these points:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check if the column is safe\n    for r in range(row):\n        if board[r][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the upper left diagonal\n    for r, c in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[r][c] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check the upper right diagonal\n    for r, c in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[r][c] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens_on_board():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]\n    ]\n\n    queens = []\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, queens)\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens)\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nplace_queens_on_board()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Restricted Positions**: The board uses `-1` to represent restricted positions ('X'), ensuring that queens are not placed there.\n- **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function checks for conflicts in columns and diagonals, ensuring no queens can attack each other.\n- **Backtracking**: The algorithm attempts to place queens row by row, backtracking when necessary.\n\nThis code should correctly handle the constraints and provide a valid solution for placing the remaining queens."

    "The current solution uses a backtracking approach, which is a suitable method for solving the N-Queens problem. However, ensure that the code correctly handles the constraints of the problem, such as the restricted 'X' positions. Double-check the logic in the `is_safe` function to ensure it correctly accounts for these restrictions. Additionally, verify that the initial board setup accurately reflects the given problem statement, including any pre-placed queens.
