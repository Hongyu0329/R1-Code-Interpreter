  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n10000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000X00\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means queens are placed at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We already have one queen placed at (4,0) and a restricted cell at (7,5) marked with 'X'. We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: We'll use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row. For each row, we'll try placing a queen in each column, checking if it's a valid position (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not on an 'X').\n\n3. **Check Validity**: For each attempted position, check if it's valid by ensuring:\n   - No other queen is in the same column.\n   - No other queen is on the same diagonal.\n   - The position is not marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Recursive Placement**: If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col):\n    # Check column\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i] == col:\n            return False\n    # Check diagonals\n    for i in range(row):\n        if abs(board[i] - col) == abs(i - row):\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, restricted):\n    if row == 8:\n        return True\n    for col in range(8):\n        if (row, col) in restricted:\n            continue\n        if is_valid(board, row, col):\n            board[row] = col\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, restricted):\n                return True\n            board[row] = -1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Initial board setup\n    board = [-1] * 8\n    board[4] = 0  # Queen already placed at (4,0)\n    restricted = {(7, 5)}  # Restricted position\n\n    # Solve the problem\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, restricted):\n        result = [f\"{i} {board[i]}\" for i in range(8)]\n        print(f\"<<<{', '.join(result)}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all 8 queens in the required format."
