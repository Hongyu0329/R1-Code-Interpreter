    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. We also need to respect the positions marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We need to understand the current placement of queens and the restricted positions.\n\n2. **Determine the Rows and Columns Already Occupied**: Since queens are already placed in some rows and columns, we need to keep track of these to avoid placing another queen in the same row or column.\n\n3. **Check Diagonals**: We need to ensure that no two queens are placed on the same diagonal. There are two types of diagonals to consider: \n   - The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).\n   - The anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n\n4. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in the remaining rows, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(1, 4), (7, 0)]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints. The `solve_n_queens` function uses backtracking to find a valid configuration, and the `place_queens` function initializes the board and calls the solver. The solution is printed in the required format.",
