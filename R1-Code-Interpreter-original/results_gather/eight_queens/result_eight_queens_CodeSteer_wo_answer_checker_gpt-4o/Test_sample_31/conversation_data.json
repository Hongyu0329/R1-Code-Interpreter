    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed. We need to place the remaining queens while respecting the constraints of the problem.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other. If a placement leads to a conflict, backtrack and try a different position.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: For each potential position, check if placing a queen there would result in a conflict with existing queens or violate the 'X' constraint.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row=0):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    solve_n_queens(board)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "Let's address the issue by ensuring that the solution correctly places exactly eight queens on the board while respecting the constraints, including the 'X' positions. We'll refine the backtracking approach to handle these constraints properly and ensure that the solution is valid.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Convert 'X' to a special marker (e.g., -1) to indicate blocked positions.\n\n2. **Backtracking with Constraints**: Implement a backtracking algorithm that places queens row by row. Ensure that no queen is placed in a column, row, or diagonal that is already occupied or blocked.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: Before placing a queen, check if the position is safe and not blocked by 'X'.\n\n4. **Count Queens**: Ensure that exactly eight queens are placed on the board.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row=0, queens_placed=0):\n    if queens_placed == 8:\n        return True\n\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return False\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_placed + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    # Try next row if no column in this row is suitable\n    return solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_placed)\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    solve_n_queens(board)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should correctly place exactly eight queens on the board, respecting the constraints, and output their positions in the required format.",
