    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, specifically the cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given board configuration, marking the positions where queens are already placed and where they cannot be placed ('X').\n\n2. **Track Constraints**: Use sets to keep track of columns, positive diagonals, and negative diagonals that are already under attack by existing queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Implement a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row:\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not under attack and not marked with 'X'.\n   - If a valid position is found, mark the column and diagonals as under attack and move to the next row.\n   - If a solution is found (all queens placed), return the positions.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    def is_safe(row, col):\n        return col not in cols and (row - col) not in neg_diags and (row + col) not in pos_diags and board[row][col] != 'X'\n\n    def place_queens(row):\n        if row == 8:\n            return True\n        for col in range(8):\n            if is_safe(row, col):\n                queens.append((row, col))\n                cols.add(col)\n                neg_diags.add(row - col)\n                pos_diags.add(row + col)\n                if place_queens(row + 1):\n                    return True\n                queens.pop()\n                cols.remove(col)\n                neg_diags.remove(row - col)\n                pos_diags.remove(row + col)\n        return False\n\n    queens = []\n    cols = set()\n    neg_diags = set()\n    pos_diags = set()\n\n    # Mark the initial board constraints\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == '1':\n                queens.append((r, c))\n                cols.add(c)\n                neg_diags.add(r - c)\n                pos_diags.add(r + c)\n\n    # Start placing queens from the first row\n    place_queens(0)\n\n    # Format the output\n    return '<<<' + ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in queens) + '>>>'\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],\n    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\n# Solve the problem\nprint(solve_n_queens(board))\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format."
