    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some cells already occupied by queens and one cell marked with 'X' where a queen cannot be placed.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start by identifying the positions of the already placed queens and the restricted cell.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens. This involves:\n   - Trying to place a queen in each row.\n   - Checking if the position is safe (i.e., not in the same column or diagonal as any other queen and not in a restricted cell).\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen leads to a dead end, backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens_positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Mark the initial queen positions\n    board[7][1] = 1\n\n    queens_positions = [(7, 1)]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, queens_positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens_positions)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints and output their positions in the specified format.",
    "To address the issues and improve the solution, we need to ensure that the initial placement of the queen at (7, 1) is respected, and the cell marked with 'X' is not considered for placing a queen. Additionally, we can use sets to efficiently track columns and diagonals that are under attack, which will help in quickly checking if a position is safe for placing a queen.\n\nHere's the revised plan and code:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given board configuration, marking the initial queen and the restricted cell.\n\n2. **Tracking Attacks**: Use sets to track columns, and both diagonals (major and minor) that are under attack by any queen.\n\n3. **Backtracking with Constraints**: Implement the backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens, ensuring that no queen is placed in an attacked column or diagonal, and avoiding the restricted cell.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nHere's the revised Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(row, col, cols, major_diags, minor_diags):\n    return col not in cols and (row - col) not in major_diags and (row + col) not in minor_diags\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, cols, major_diags, minor_diags, queens_positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(row, col, cols, major_diags, minor_diags):\n            # Place the queen\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            cols.add(col)\n            major_diags.add(row - col)\n            minor_diags.add(row + col)\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n\n            # Move to the next row\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, cols, major_diags, minor_diags, queens_positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            cols.remove(col)\n            major_diags.remove(row - col)\n            minor_diags.remove(row + col)\n            queens_positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Initial queen position\n    queens_positions = [(7, 1)]\n\n    # Track columns and diagonals under attack\n    cols = {1}\n    major_diags = {7 - 1}\n    minor_diags = {7 + 1}\n\n    # Start solving from the first row\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, cols, major_diags, minor_diags, queens_positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens_positions)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code correctly initializes the board with the given constraints and uses sets to efficiently track columns and diagonals under attack, ensuring that the backtracking algorithm respects these constraints throughout the search process.",
