  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid initialized to 0, representing empty cells.\n\n2. **Place Initial Queens**: If there are any initial queens already placed, mark those positions on the board.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens:\n   - Try placing a queen in each row, one by one.\n   - For each row, try placing the queen in each column.\n   - Check if the current position is safe (i.e., no other queens in the same column, and no queens on the same diagonals).\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing the queen leads to a solution, return the positions.\n   - If not, backtrack and try the next position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    positions = []\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format. Note that this assumes no initial queens or 'X' positions are given, as the problem statement did not specify any. If there are specific initial conditions, they should be incorporated into the `board` initialization.",
    "To incorporate initial conditions such as pre-placed queens and restricted positions marked with 'X', we need to modify the board setup and the backtracking algorithm. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with an 8x8 grid. Mark cells with '1' for pre-placed queens and 'X' for restricted positions.\n\n2. **Modify the Safety Check**: Ensure that the safety check accounts for 'X' positions, meaning we cannot place a queen in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use the backtracking approach to place the remaining queens, considering the initial conditions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    # Initialize the board with given conditions\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Example of pre-placed queens and restricted positions\n    # board[0][0] = 1  # Pre-placed queen\n    # board[1][2] = 'X'  # Restricted position\n\n    positions = [(i, j) for i in range(8) for j in range(8) if board[i][j] == 1]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n        print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution exists\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nIn this code, you can modify the `board` initialization to include any pre-placed queens (marked with `1`) and restricted positions (marked with `'X'`). The algorithm will then attempt to place the remaining queens while respecting these constraints.",
