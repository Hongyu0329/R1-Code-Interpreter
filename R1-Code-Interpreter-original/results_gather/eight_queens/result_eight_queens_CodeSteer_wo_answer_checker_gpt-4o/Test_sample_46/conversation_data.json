    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Board State**: We need to understand the current placement of queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Track Occupied Rows, Columns, and Diagonals**: We will maintain sets to track which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens in each row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other and avoiding 'X' positions.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_n_queens(board):\n    def is_safe(row, col):\n        return (col not in cols and\n                (row - col) not in diag1 and\n                (row + col) not in diag2 and\n                board[row][col] != 'X')\n\n    def place_queens(row):\n        if row == 8:\n            return True\n        for col in range(8):\n            if is_safe(row, col):\n                board[row][col] = 1\n                cols.add(col)\n                diag1.add(row - col)\n                diag2.add(row + col)\n                if place_queens(row + 1):\n                    return True\n                board[row][col] = 0\n                cols.remove(col)\n                diag1.remove(row - col)\n                diag2.remove(row + col)\n        return False\n\n    # Initialize the board\n    board = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n    # Initialize sets to track columns and diagonals\n    cols = set()\n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n\n    # Mark the existing queens\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == 1:\n                cols.add(c)\n                diag1.add(r - c)\n                diag2.add(r + c)\n\n    # Start placing queens from the first row\n    place_queens(0)\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            if board[r][c] == 1:\n                queen_positions.append(f\"{r} {c}\")\n\n    print(f\"<<<{', '.join(queen_positions)}>>>\")\n\nsolve_n_queens([])\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all queens in the required format.",
