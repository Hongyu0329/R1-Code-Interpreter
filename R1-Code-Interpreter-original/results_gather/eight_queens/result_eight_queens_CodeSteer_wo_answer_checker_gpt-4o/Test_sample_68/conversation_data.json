    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We already have one queen placed at position (4, 2). We also have a restricted cell at position (5, 5) marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initialize the Board**: Create an 8x8 board to represent the current state, with '1' for the queen, '0' for empty cells, and 'X' for restricted cells.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens. This involves:\n   - Trying to place a queen in each row.\n   - Checking if the position is safe (i.e., not in the same column, row, or diagonal as another queen and not on an 'X').\n   - If a position is safe, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If placing a queen leads to a dead end, backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(4, 2)]\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and print their positions in the required format.",
    "Let's address the issue by ensuring that the backtracking algorithm correctly places exactly eight queens on the board, considering the initial constraints. The problem arises because the algorithm doesn't account for the pre-placed queen and the restricted cell properly. We need to adjust the logic to start placing queens from the first row and ensure that the pre-placed queen is considered in the solution.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Create an 8x8 board with the initial queen and restricted cell marked.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: Modify the backtracking function to:\n   - Start placing queens from the first row.\n   - Skip the row with the pre-placed queen.\n   - Ensure that the total number of queens placed is exactly eight.\n\n3. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nLet's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if len(positions) == 8:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X' or board[row][col] == 1:\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(4, 2)]\n    # Start from the first row\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code should correctly place the remaining queens on the board, ensuring that the total number of queens is eight, and output their positions in the required format."

    "The current solution attempts to solve the problem using a backtracking approach, which is a suitable method for the N-Queens problem. However, the solution seems to have an error in the output, as it includes more than eight positions, which is incorrect for an 8-queen problem.

Additionally, verify that the initial queen position and restricted cell are correctly handled.
