A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 grid with some positions marked as 'X' where queens cannot be placed. We need to place 8 queens in total.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given board and identify any pre-placed queens. In this case, the board is empty except for the 'X' marks.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking algorithm to place queens one by one in each row. For each row, try placing a queen in each column, checking if the position is safe (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not marked with 'X').\n\n4. **Check Safety**: A position is safe if:\n   - No other queen is in the same column.\n   - No other queen is in the same diagonal (both major and minor diagonals).\n\n5. **Recursive Placement**: If a safe position is found, place the queen and move to the next row. If no safe position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "Let's review the implementation to ensure that the 'X' positions are correctly handled and that the solution respects these constraints. The current implementation should already account for 'X' positions by marking them as non-placeable with `-1`. However, let's ensure that the solution correctly checks these positions during the placement of queens.\n\nHere's a revised version of the code with additional checks to ensure that queens are not placed on 'X' positions:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        # Check if the position is not marked with 'X' and is safe\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0],  # 'X' is marked as -1\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0],  # 'X' is marked as -1\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0]   # 'X' is marked as -1\n    ]\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions) + \">>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nIn this code, the `solve_n_queens` function checks if a position is both safe and not marked with `-1` (representing 'X') before placing a queen. This ensures that queens are not placed on forbidden positions. The output will be the positions of the queens in the required format if a solution is found."
