    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We already have one queen placed at position (0, 3). We need to place 7 more queens on the board.\n\n2. **Mark Forbidden Positions**: \n   - Mark the row and column of the existing queen as forbidden.\n   - Mark the diagonals of the existing queen as forbidden.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not forbidden.\n   - If a queen is placed, mark the corresponding row, column, and diagonals as forbidden for subsequent queens.\n   - If a placement leads to a solution, return the positions.\n   - If not, backtrack and try a different position.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of all queens.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef place_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    board[0][3] = 1  # Initial queen position\n\n    positions = [(0, 3)]\n    solve_n_queens(board, 1, n, positions)\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = ', '.join(f'{r} {c}' for r, c in positions)\n    print(f'<<<{result}>>>')\n\nplace_queens()\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of all queens in the required format."
