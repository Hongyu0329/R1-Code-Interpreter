    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have some constraints: queens cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal, and certain positions are marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There are already two queens placed:\n     - At position (0, 4)\n     - At position (1, 1)\n   - Positions (5, 2) and (6, 2) are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place queens in positions marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 0 has a queen at column 4.\n   - Row 1 has a queen at column 1.\n   - Rows 2 to 7 are empty.\n   - Columns 4 and 1 are occupied.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queens at (0, 4) and (1, 1) need to be considered.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (2 to 7).\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Columns 1 and 4 are occupied.\n     - Diagonals from (0, 4) and (1, 1) affect columns 3 and 5.\n     - Place a queen at (2, 6).\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Columns 1, 4, and 6 are occupied.\n     - Diagonals affect columns 2, 5, and 7.\n     - Place a queen at (3, 0).\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Columns 0, 1, 4, and 6 are occupied.\n     - Diagonals affect columns 3 and 5.\n     - Place a queen at (4, 7).\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Columns 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7 are occupied.\n     - Diagonals affect columns 2 and 5.\n     - Place a queen at (5, 3).\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are occupied.\n     - Diagonals affect columns 2 and 5.\n     - Place a queen at (6, 5).\n\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - Columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are occupied.\n     - Diagonals affect columns 2.\n     - Place a queen at (7, 2).\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 4), (1, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (4, 7), (5, 3), (6, 5), (7, 2).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 1 1, 2 6, 3 0, 4 7, 5 3, 6 5, 7 2>>>"
