    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row.\n   - No two queens can be in the same column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal (both major and minor diagonals).\n\n3. **Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   0000X000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00X00000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   ```\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** The only restriction is the 'X' at column 4. We can place a queen in any of the columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Let's place a queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 1:** No restrictions from 'X'. We cannot place a queen in column 0 (due to the queen at (0, 0)). Let's place a queen at (1, 2).\n   - **Row 2:** No restrictions from 'X'. We cannot place a queen in columns 0 or 2. Let's place a queen at (2, 4).\n   - **Row 3:** No restrictions from 'X'. We cannot place a queen in columns 0, 2, or 4. Let's place a queen at (3, 6).\n   - **Row 4:** No restrictions from 'X'. We cannot place a queen in columns 0, 2, 4, or 6. Let's place a queen at (4, 1).\n   - **Row 5:** There is an 'X' at column 2. We cannot place a queen in columns 0, 1, 4, or 6. Let's place a queen at (5, 3).\n   - **Row 6:** No restrictions from 'X'. We cannot place a queen in columns 0, 1, 3, or 4. Let's place a queen at (6, 5).\n   - **Row 7:** No restrictions from 'X'. We cannot place a queen in columns 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place a queen at (7, 7).\n\n5. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions: (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 3), (6, 5), (7, 7).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
