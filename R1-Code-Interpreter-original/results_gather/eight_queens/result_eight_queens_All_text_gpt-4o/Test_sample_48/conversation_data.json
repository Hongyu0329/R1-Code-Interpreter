A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have some constraints due to the existing queens and the 'X' marked cells where queens cannot be placed. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Cells marked with '1' already have queens.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - Row 0: X0000000 (No queens, 'X' at column 0)\n   - Row 1: 00000010 (Queen at column 6)\n   - Row 2: 00X00000 (No queens, 'X' at column 2)\n   - Row 3: 0X100000 (Queen at column 2, 'X' at column 1)\n   - Row 4: 00000000 (No queens)\n   - Row 5: 00000000 (No queens)\n   - Row 6: 00000000 (No queens)\n   - Row 7: 00000000 (No queens)\n\n3. **Queens Already Placed:**\n   - Row 1, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 2\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid 'X' marked cells.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Place one queen per row.\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place in column 0 due to 'X'. Place queen at column 4.\n   - **Row 1:** Already has a queen at column 6.\n   - **Row 2:** Cannot place in column 2 due to 'X'. Place queen at column 7.\n   - **Row 3:** Already has a queen at column 2.\n   - **Row 4:** Place queen at column 1 (no conflicts with existing queens).\n   - **Row 5:** Place queen at column 3 (no conflicts with existing queens).\n   - **Row 6:** Place queen at column 5 (no conflicts with existing queens).\n   - **Row 7:** Place queen at column 0 (no conflicts with existing queens).\n\n7. **Final Queen Positions:**\n   - Row 0, Column 4\n   - Row 1, Column 6\n   - Row 2, Column 7\n   - Row 3, Column 2\n   - Row 4, Column 1\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 5\n   - Row 7, Column 0\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 1 6, 2 7, 3 2, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 0>>>"
