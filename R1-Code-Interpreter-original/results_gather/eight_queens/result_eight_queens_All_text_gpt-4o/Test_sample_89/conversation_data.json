    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the grid, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have queens placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 X 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X\n   0 X 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n   - We need to place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1,2).\n   - **Row 2:** The position (2,1) is blocked. Place a queen at (2,4).\n   - **Row 3:** The position (3,7) is blocked. Place a queen at (3,6).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4,1).\n   - **Row 5:** The position (5,7) is blocked. Place a queen at (5,3).\n   - **Row 6:** The position (6,1) is blocked. Place a queen at (6,5).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7,7).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nAfter placing the queens according to the above steps, the final positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
