A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints:**\n   - The board has 'X' marks at positions (2,1), (2,6), (3,5), and (6,7). These positions cannot have queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The board is initially empty, so we have the freedom to place queens in any row, column, or diagonal, except where 'X' marks are present.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will start from the top row and move downwards, placing queens in valid positions.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0,0). This is a valid position as there are no constraints yet.\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1,2). This avoids the column and diagonals of the queen at (0,0).\n   - **Row 2:** The position (2,1) and (2,6) are blocked. Place a queen at (2,4).\n   - **Row 3:** The position (3,5) is blocked. Place a queen at (3,7).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4,1). This avoids the columns and diagonals of all previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5,3). This avoids the columns and diagonals of all previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 6:** The position (6,7) is blocked. Place a queen at (6,5).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7,6). This avoids the columns and diagonals of all previously placed queens.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure that no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nAfter following these steps, the positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 7, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 6>>>"
