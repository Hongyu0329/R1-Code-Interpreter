A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We must also respect the constraints of not placing queens on cells marked with 'X'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Cells marked with '1' already have queens placed.\n   - Cells marked with '0' are empty and available for placing queens.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Current Queen Positions:**\n   - From the given grid, we identify the positions of the queens (marked with '1'):\n     - Row 2, Column 4 (2,4)\n     - Row 5, Column 5 (5,5)\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place a queen in the same row, column, or diagonal as another queen.\n   - We cannot place a queen in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens. Currently, 2 queens are placed, so we need to place 6 more queens.\n   - We will check each row and try to place a queen in a valid position, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** \n     - Columns available: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 (Column 5 is 'X')\n     - Place a queen at (0,0).\n\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - Columns available: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (Column 7 is 'X')\n     - Place a queen at (1,3).\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Columns available: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (3,7).\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Columns available: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (4,2).\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Columns available: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (6,1).\n\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - Columns available: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (7,6).\n\n6. **Final Queen Positions:**\n   - The final positions of the queens are:\n     - (0,0), (1,3), (2,4), (3,7), (4,2), (5,5), (6,1), (7,6)\n\nThe queens are placed such that no two queens threaten each other, and no queens are placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0 0, 1 3, 2 4, 3 7, 4 2, 5 5, 6 1, 7 6>>>"
