    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Let's analyze the given grid and determine the positions of the queens and the empty cells:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - The given grid is:\n     ```\n     00000000\n     10000000\n     00000000\n     00000100\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     01000000\n     00000000\n     ```\n   - From the grid, we can see the following queens are already placed:\n     - Row 1, Column 0 (1 0)\n     - Row 3, Column 5 (3 5)\n     - Row 6, Column 1 (6 1)\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place any more queens in rows 1, 3, and 6 as they already have queens.\n   - We cannot place any more queens in columns 0, 5, and 1 as they already have queens.\n   - We must also ensure that no two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** \n     - Columns available: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (0, 2) to avoid conflicts with existing queens.\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Columns available: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (2, 4) to avoid conflicts with existing queens.\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Columns available: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (4, 7) to avoid conflicts with existing queens.\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Columns available: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (5, 3) to avoid conflicts with existing queens.\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - Columns available: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\n     - Place a queen at (7, 6) to avoid conflicts with existing queens.\n\n4. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Verify that all rows and columns have exactly one queen.\n\n5. **Final Queen Positions:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 7), (5, 3), (6, 1), (7, 6)\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 2, 1 0, 2 4, 3 5, 4 7, 5 3, 6 1, 7 6>>>"
