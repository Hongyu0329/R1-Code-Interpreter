    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the grid, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place 8 queens.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The grid has 'X' at positions (3, 2) and (7, 1).\n   - We need to avoid these positions when placing queens.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will start from the top row and move downwards, checking each row for a valid position.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - **Row 0**: Place a queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1, 2).\n   - **Row 2**: Place a queen at (2, 4).\n   - **Row 3**: The position (3, 2) is blocked. Place a queen at (3, 6).\n   - **Row 4**: Place a queen at (4, 1).\n   - **Row 5**: Place a queen at (5, 3).\n   - **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6, 5).\n   - **Row 7**: The position (7, 1) is blocked. Place a queen at (7, 7).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Check that no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully placed all 8 queens on the board without any conflicts.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
