    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and the constraints:\n\n1. The grid is initially empty except for a queen placed at position (7, 7).\n2. We need to place a total of 8 queens, so we have 7 more queens to place.\n3. We must ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we have one queen already placed at (7, 7).\n   - We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We must avoid any cells marked with 'X', but in this case, there are no 'X' marks given.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start placing queens row by row, ensuring that each queen is placed in a unique column and does not share a diagonal with any previously placed queen.\n   - Use backtracking to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Placement:**\n   - Place a queen in each row from 0 to 6, ensuring no conflicts with the queen at (7, 7).\n\n5. **Backtracking Approach:**\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column.\n   - Check if the placement is valid (i.e., no other queens in the same column or diagonal).\n   - If valid, move to the next row.\n   - If not valid, try the next column.\n   - If all columns are tried and no valid placement is found, backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.\n\n6. **Solution:**\n   - After placing queens in rows 0 to 6, ensure that the placement does not conflict with the queen at (7, 7).\n\n### Final Placement:\n\nFollowing the above strategy, the queens can be placed at the following positions:\n\n- Row 0: Column 0\n- Row 1: Column 2\n- Row 2: Column 4\n- Row 3: Column 1\n- Row 4: Column 3\n- Row 5: Column 5\n- Row 6: Column 6\n- Row 7: Column 7 (already placed)\n\nThus, the positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 1, 4 3, 5 5, 6 6, 7 7>>>"
