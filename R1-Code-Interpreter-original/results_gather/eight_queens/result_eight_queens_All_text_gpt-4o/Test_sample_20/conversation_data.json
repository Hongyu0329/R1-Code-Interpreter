    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (0, 1), and we cannot place a queen in the cell marked with 'X' at position (1, 5).\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - A queen is already placed at (0, 1).\n   - The cell (1, 5) is marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 0: Queen at (0, 1).\n   - Row 1: Cannot place a queen at (1, 5).\n   - Rows 2 to 7: No queens placed yet.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will use backtracking to explore possible placements.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Queen is already placed at (0, 1).\n   - **Row 1:** We cannot place a queen at (1, 5). Possible columns are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Choose (1, 3).\n   - **Row 2:** Avoid columns 1 and 3. Possible columns are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. Choose (2, 5).\n   - **Row 3:** Avoid columns 1, 3, and 5. Possible columns are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7. Choose (3, 7).\n   - **Row 4:** Avoid columns 1, 3, 5, and 7. Possible columns are 0, 2, 4, 6. Choose (4, 2).\n   - **Row 5:** Avoid columns 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Possible columns are 0, 4, 6. Choose (5, 0).\n   - **Row 6:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Possible columns are 4, 6. Choose (6, 4).\n   - **Row 7:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Only column 6 is left. Choose (7, 6).\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 1)\n     - (1, 3)\n     - (2, 5)\n     - (3, 7)\n     - (4, 2)\n     - (5, 0)\n     - (6, 4)\n     - (7, 6)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 1 3, 2 5, 3 7, 4 2, 5 0, 6 4, 7 6>>>"
