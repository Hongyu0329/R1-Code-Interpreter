    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (4, 2), and we cannot place any queen in the cell marked with 'X' at position (5, 5).\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - A queen is already placed at (4, 2).\n   - The cell (5, 5) is marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 4 has a queen at column 2.\n   - Column 2 has a queen at row 4.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queen at (4, 2) are:\n     - From top-left to bottom-right: (3, 1), (2, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (7, 5)\n     - From top-right to bottom-left: (3, 3), (2, 4), (1, 5), (0, 6), (5, 1), (6, 0)\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place queens row by row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other.\n   - We will avoid placing queens in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 6) (not in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 4) (not in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 0) (not in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 5) (not in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 7) (not in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 1) (not in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 3) (not in the same column or diagonal as any existing queen).\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure all queens are placed in valid positions.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 6, 1 4, 2 0, 3 5, 4 2, 5 7, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
