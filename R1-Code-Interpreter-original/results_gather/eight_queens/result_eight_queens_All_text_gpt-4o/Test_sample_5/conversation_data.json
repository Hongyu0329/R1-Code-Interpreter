    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (0, 5), and we have a restriction at position (3, 1) marked with 'X', where a queen cannot be placed. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - A queen is already placed at (0, 5).\n   - Position (3, 1) is restricted (marked with 'X').\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 0: Queen at column 5.\n   - Row 3: Column 1 is restricted.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n   - We must ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Cannot place in column 5 (same column as (0, 5)).\n     - Place queen at (1, 0).\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Cannot place in columns 0 or 5 (diagonals from (1, 0) and (0, 5)).\n     - Place queen at (2, 6).\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Cannot place in column 1 (restricted) or columns 0, 5, 6 (diagonals from (1, 0), (0, 5), and (2, 6)).\n     - Place queen at (3, 7).\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Cannot place in columns 0, 5, 6, 7 (diagonals from (1, 0), (0, 5), (2, 6), and (3, 7)).\n     - Place queen at (4, 2).\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Cannot place in columns 0, 2, 5, 6, 7 (diagonals from (1, 0), (4, 2), (0, 5), (2, 6), and (3, 7)).\n     - Place queen at (5, 4).\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Cannot place in columns 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 (diagonals from (1, 0), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 5), (2, 6), and (3, 7)).\n     - Place queen at (6, 3).\n\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - Cannot place in columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (diagonals from (1, 0), (4, 2), (6, 3), (5, 4), (0, 5), (2, 6), and (3, 7)).\n     - Place queen at (7, 1).\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 6), (3, 7), (4, 2), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 1).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 5, 1 0, 2 6, 3 7, 4 2, 5 4, 6 3, 7 1>>>"
