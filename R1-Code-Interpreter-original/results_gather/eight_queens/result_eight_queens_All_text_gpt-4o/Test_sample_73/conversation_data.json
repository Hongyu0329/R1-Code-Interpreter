A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We must also respect the constraints of the grid, including the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is already one queen placed at position (1, 3).\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens: (4, 7), (5, 2), and (7, 0).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens, and one is already placed.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will avoid placing queens in positions marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 5). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queen at (1, 3).\n   - **Row 1:** A queen is already placed at (1, 3).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 7). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 5) and (1, 3).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 0). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 5), (1, 3), and (2, 7).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 6). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 7), and (3, 0).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 4). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 7), (3, 0), and (4, 6).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 1). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 7), (3, 0), (4, 6), and (5, 4).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 2). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 7), (3, 0), (4, 6), (5, 4), and (6, 1).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Each row has exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens are in the same column.\n   - No two queens are on the same diagonal.\n   - No queens are placed on positions marked with 'X'.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 5, 1 3, 2 7, 3 0, 4 6, 5 4, 6 1, 7 2>>>"
