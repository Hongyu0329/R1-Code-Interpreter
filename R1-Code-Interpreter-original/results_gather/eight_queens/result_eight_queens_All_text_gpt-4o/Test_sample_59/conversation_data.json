    "To solve the problem of placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other, we need to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty, with no queens placed and no cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Strategy for Placement**:\n   - We will place one queen per row.\n   - Ensure that each queen is placed in a unique column.\n   - Check diagonals to ensure no two queens threaten each other.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in the first available column.\n   - Move to the next row and place a queen in a column that is not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queens.\n   - Continue this process for all rows.\n\n5. **Check for Diagonal Conflicts**:\n   - For each queen placed, ensure that no other queen is on the same diagonal. This can be checked by ensuring that the difference between the row and column indices of any two queens is not the same.\n\n6. **Iterate and Adjust**:\n   - If a conflict arises, backtrack and try a different column for the previous queen.\n   - Continue this process until all queens are placed without conflict.\n\n7. **Final Placement**:\n   - After successfully placing all queens, list their positions.\n\nGiven the initial empty board, the solution is straightforward as there are no 'X' constraints. We can place the queens as follows:\n\n- Row 0: Place a queen at column 0.\n- Row 1: Place a queen at column 2.\n- Row 2: Place a queen at column 4.\n- Row 3: Place a queen at column 6.\n- Row 4: Place a queen at column 1.\n- Row 5: Place a queen at column 3.\n- Row 6: Place a queen at column 5.\n- Row 7: Place a queen at column 7.\n\nThis placement ensures that no two queens threaten each other.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
