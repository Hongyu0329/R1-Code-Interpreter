A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve the problem of placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other, we need to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty, with no queens placed and no cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Strategy for Placement**:\n   - We will place one queen per row.\n   - We will ensure that each queen is placed in a unique column.\n   - We will check diagonals to ensure no two queens threaten each other.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in the first available column.\n   - Move to the next row and place a queen in a column that is not threatened by any previously placed queens.\n   - Continue this process for all rows.\n\n5. **Check for Diagonal Threats**:\n   - For each queen placed, ensure that no other queen is on the same diagonal.\n   - Diagonals can be checked using the formula: \n     - For the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), the difference between row and column indices should be unique.\n     - For the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), the sum of row and column indices should be unique.\n\n6. **Backtracking**:\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen without being threatened, backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.\n\n7. **Final Placement**:\n   - After placing all queens, verify that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven that the board is initially empty and there are no 'X' marks, we can proceed with a standard solution to the 8-queens problem.\n\nThe solution is as follows:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
