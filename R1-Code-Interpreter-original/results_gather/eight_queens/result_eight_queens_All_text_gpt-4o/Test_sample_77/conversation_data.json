    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have to consider the constraints of the problem: no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is already one queen placed at position (1, 3).\n   - There are two cells marked with 'X' at positions (3, 4) and (6, 2) and (6, 3).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place any queens in row 1, column 3, or any diagonals that intersect with (1, 3).\n   - We cannot place any queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** We can place a queen at (0, 5). This position does not conflict with the existing queen or the 'X' marks.\n   - **Row 2:** We can place a queen at (2, 7). This position is safe from the existing queen and 'X' marks.\n   - **Row 3:** We can place a queen at (3, 0). This position is safe from the existing queen and 'X' marks.\n   - **Row 4:** We can place a queen at (4, 6). This position is safe from the existing queen and 'X' marks.\n   - **Row 5:** We can place a queen at (5, 2). This position is safe from the existing queen and 'X' marks.\n   - **Row 6:** We can place a queen at (6, 4). This position is safe from the existing queen and 'X' marks.\n   - **Row 7:** We can place a queen at (7, 1). This position is safe from the existing queen and 'X' marks.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure that no queens are placed on 'X' marks.\n\nAfter placing the queens as described, we have a valid solution to the problem.\n\nThe final answer with the positions of all queens is:\n<<<0 5, 1 3, 2 7, 3 0, 4 6, 5 2, 6 4, 7 1>>>"
