    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints given by the 'X' marks, where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Board Constraints:**\n   - The board is 8x8.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to place a total of eight queens.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   - The board is initially empty except for the 'X' marks.\n   - The given board is:\n     ```\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     0000X000\n     0000000X\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     ```\n\n3. **Identify Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place queens in the positions (2,4) and (3,7) due to the 'X' marks.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n4. **Strategy for Placing Queens:**\n   - Start placing queens row by row, ensuring that each queen is placed in a valid position.\n   - Use backtracking to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1,2).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2,6) (since (2,4) is blocked).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3,1) (since (3,7) is blocked).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4,3).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5,5).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6,7).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7,4).\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully place all eight queens on the board.\n\nThe final answer with the positions of the queens is:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 6, 3 1, 4 3, 5 5, 6 7, 7 4>>>"
