A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given board and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   - The board is an 8x8 grid.\n   - There is a restriction on the cell (2,5) marked with 'X', meaning we cannot place a queen there.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Place a total of eight queens on the board.\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid placing a queen on the cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - Start with the first row (row 0) and try placing a queen in each column, checking for conflicts.\n   - Move to the next row and repeat the process, ensuring no conflicts with previously placed queens.\n   - If a conflict arises, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible column.\n   - Continue this process until all queens are placed.\n\n5. **Considerations:**\n   - Ensure that no queen is placed in the column of the 'X' cell (column 5 for row 2).\n   - Keep track of columns and diagonals that are already occupied by queens.\n\n6. **Solution:**\n   - After applying the above strategy, we find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 6, 3 1, 4 5, 5 2, 6 7, 7 3>>>"
