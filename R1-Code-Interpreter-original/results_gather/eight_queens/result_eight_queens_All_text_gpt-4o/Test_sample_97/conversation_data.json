    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   - The board is initially empty except for the 'X' marks.\n   - The 'X' marks are at positions (3,5), (7,1), (7,5), and (7,6).\n\n3. **Strategy for Placing Queens:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will avoid placing queens in positions marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0,0). This is the first available position in row 0.\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1,2). This avoids the column and diagonal of the queen in row 0.\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2,4). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens in rows 0 and 1.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3,7). This avoids the 'X' at (3,5) and the columns and diagonals of the queens in previous rows.\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4,1). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens in previous rows.\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5,3). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens in previous rows.\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6,6). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens in previous rows.\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7,4). This avoids the 'X' marks and the columns and diagonals of the queens in previous rows.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure that no queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nAfter following these steps, the positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 7, 4 1, 5 3, 6 6, 7 4>>>"
