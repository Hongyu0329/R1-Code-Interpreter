    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have some queens placed, and we must respect the constraints of the grid, including the blocked cell marked with 'X'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Queens are already placed at positions (0,1) and (2,2).\n   - The cell (5,7) is blocked and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 0 has a queen at column 1.\n   - Row 2 has a queen at column 2.\n   - Row 5 has a blocked cell at column 7.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place queens in the remaining rows: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - We must ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 1:** The only available columns are 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We cannot place a queen in column 1 or 2 due to existing queens. Place a queen at (1,0).\n   - **Row 3:** The available columns are 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Columns 1 and 2 are blocked by existing queens. Place a queen at (3,4).\n   - **Row 4:** The available columns are 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Columns 1, 2, and 4 are blocked. Place a queen at (4,6).\n   - **Row 5:** The available columns are 0, 3, 4, and 5. Columns 1, 2, 6, and 7 are blocked. Place a queen at (5,3).\n   - **Row 6:** The available columns are 0, 4, 5, and 7. Columns 1, 2, 3, and 6 are blocked. Place a queen at (6,5).\n   - **Row 7:** The available columns are 0, 3, and 7. Columns 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are blocked. Place a queen at (7,7).\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Verify that all rows have one queen and the blocked cell is not used.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 2 2, 3 4, 4 6, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
