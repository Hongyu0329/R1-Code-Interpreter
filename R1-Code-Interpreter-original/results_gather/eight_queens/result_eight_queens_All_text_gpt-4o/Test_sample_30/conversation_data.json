A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal, and we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There are already two queens placed at positions (2, 6) and (7, 0).\n   - There are two restricted positions marked with 'X' at (6, 3) and (7, 6).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Queens are placed at (2, 6) and (7, 0).\n   - Restricted positions are (6, 3) and (7, 6).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 4). This column and diagonals are not occupied.\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 2). This column and diagonals are not occupied.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 1). This column and diagonals are not occupied.\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 7). This column and diagonals are not occupied.\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 5). This column and diagonals are not occupied.\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 3). This column and diagonals are not occupied, and it is not marked with 'X'.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nAfter placing the queens as described, the board will have queens at the following positions:\n\n<<<0 4, 1 2, 2 6, 3 1, 4 7, 5 5, 6 3, 7 0>>>"
