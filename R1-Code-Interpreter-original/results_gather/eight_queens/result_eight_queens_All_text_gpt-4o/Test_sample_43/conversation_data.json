    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We must also respect the constraints of the grid, including the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - Some positions are marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are off-limits.\n\n3. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - The board is initially empty (all zeros) except for the 'X' positions.\n   - We need to place all 8 queens.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Start placing queens row by row or column by column.\n   - Ensure that each queen placed does not conflict with any previously placed queens.\n   - Avoid 'X' positions.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0) since it's the first available position.\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 1) since (1, 0) is in the same column as (0, 0).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 3) since (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2) are in the same column or diagonal as previous queens.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 5) since (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), and (3, 4) are in the same column or diagonal as previous queens.\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 7) since (4, 0) to (4, 6) are in the same column or diagonal as previous queens.\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 2) since (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6) are in the same column or diagonal as previous queens.\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 4) since (6, 0) to (6, 3) are in the same column or diagonal as previous queens.\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 6) since (7, 0) to (7, 5) are in the same column or diagonal as previous queens.\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens threaten each other.\n   - Ensure no queen is placed on an 'X' position.\n\nAfter following these steps, the queens are placed as follows:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 1, 2 3, 3 5, 4 7, 5 2, 6 4, 7 6>>>"
