    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 X 0 0\n```\n\n1. **Identify the existing queen**: There is already a queen placed at position (4, 0).\n\n2. **Mark the restricted areas**:\n   - Row 4 is occupied by a queen, so no other queen can be placed in this row.\n   - Column 0 is occupied by a queen, so no other queen can be placed in this column.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queen at (4, 0) are:\n     - The main diagonal (/) from (4, 0) affects (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4), (5, -1), (6, -2), (7, -3).\n     - The anti-diagonal (\\) from (4, 0) affects (3, -1), (2, -2), (1, -3), (0, -4), (5, 1), (6, 2), (7, 3).\n\n3. **Avoid the 'X' position**: The position (7, 5) is marked with 'X', so no queen can be placed there.\n\n4. **Place the remaining queens**:\n   - We need to place 7 more queens on the board.\n   - Start placing queens row by row, ensuring no two queens attack each other.\n\nLet's place the queens:\n\n- **Row 0**: Place a queen at (0, 2). This position is not attacked by any existing queens.\n- **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1, 4). This position is not attacked by any existing queens.\n- **Row 2**: Place a queen at (2, 6). This position is not attacked by any existing queens.\n- **Row 3**: Place a queen at (3, 1). This position is not attacked by any existing queens.\n- **Row 5**: Place a queen at (5, 3). This position is not attacked by any existing queens.\n- **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6, 5). This position is not attacked by any existing queens.\n- **Row 7**: Place a queen at (7, 7). This position is not attacked by any existing queens.\n\nNow, we have placed all 8 queens on the board without any two queens attacking each other.\n\nFinal positions of the queens are:\n- (0, 2)\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 6)\n- (3, 1)\n- (4, 0) (already placed)\n- (5, 3)\n- (6, 5)\n- (7, 7)\n\nThe answer is: <<<0 2, 1 4, 2 6, 3 1, 4 0, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
