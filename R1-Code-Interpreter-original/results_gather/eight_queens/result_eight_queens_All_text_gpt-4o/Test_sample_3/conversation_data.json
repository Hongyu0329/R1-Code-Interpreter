  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means queens are placed at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - Queens cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are off-limits for placing queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Start with an empty 8x8 grid.\n   - Mark any cells with 'X' as unavailable for placing queens.\n\n3. **Place Queens**:\n   - Begin placing queens row by row, ensuring that each queen is placed in a valid position.\n   - For each row, find a column where a queen can be placed such that it does not conflict with any previously placed queens.\n   - Check diagonals to ensure no two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\n4. **Backtracking**:\n   - If you reach a row where no valid position is available for a queen, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position for the queen there.\n   - Continue this process until all queens are placed successfully.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the specified format.\n\nGiven that the grid is initially empty and there are no 'X' marks, we can proceed with placing the queens using the above steps. Here's a possible solution:\n\n- Place a queen in each row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\nFollowing these steps, one possible solution is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
