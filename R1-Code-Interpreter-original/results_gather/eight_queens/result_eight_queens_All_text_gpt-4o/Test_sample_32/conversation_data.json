    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the grid, such as the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There are already two queens placed: one at (6,0) and another at (4,5).\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are (6,5) and (7,2).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place any queens in the same row or column as the existing queens.\n   - We cannot place any queens on the diagonals of the existing queens.\n   - We cannot place any queens on the 'X' marked positions.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens, and 2 are already placed, so we need to place 6 more queens.\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** No queens are placed yet. We can place a queen at (0,3).\n   - **Row 1:** No queens are placed yet. We can place a queen at (1,7).\n   - **Row 2:** No queens are placed yet. We can place a queen at (2,1).\n   - **Row 3:** No queens are placed yet. We can place a queen at (3,6).\n   - **Row 4:** Already has a queen at (4,5).\n   - **Row 5:** No queens are placed yet. We can place a queen at (5,2).\n   - **Row 6:** Already has a queen at (6,0).\n   - **Row 7:** No queens are placed yet. We can place a queen at (7,4).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' marked positions.\n\nAfter placing the queens as described, we have the following positions for the queens:\n\n- (0,3)\n- (1,7)\n- (2,1)\n- (3,6)\n- (4,5)\n- (5,2)\n- (6,0)\n- (7,4)\n\nThese positions satisfy all the constraints of the problem.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0 3, 1 7, 2 1, 3 6, 4 5, 5 2, 6 0, 7 4>>>"
