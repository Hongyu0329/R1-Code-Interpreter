    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Analysis:**\n   - The board is initially empty except for a queen placed at position (7, 7).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We must avoid any cells marked with 'X' (though none are marked in the given board).\n\n3. **Current Board State:**\n   - The board has a queen at position (7, 7).\n   - This means row 7 and column 7 are occupied.\n   - The diagonals affected by this queen are:\n     - Main diagonal: (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (0, 0)\n     - Anti-diagonal: (6, 8), (5, 9), (4, 10), (3, 11), (2, 12), (1, 13), (0, 14) (out of bounds, so not relevant)\n\n4. **Strategy for Placing Remaining Queens:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (0 to 6).\n   - We must ensure that no two queens share the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 4). This position is not on any diagonal affected by the queen at (7, 7).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 6). This position is not on any diagonal affected by the queens at (0, 4) or (7, 7).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 1). This position is not on any diagonal affected by the queens at (0, 4), (1, 6), or (7, 7).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 5). This position is not on any diagonal affected by the queens at (0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), or (7, 7).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 0). This position is not on any diagonal affected by the queens at (0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 5), or (7, 7).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 2). This position is not on any diagonal affected by the queens at (0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 5), (4, 0), or (7, 7).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 3). This position is not on any diagonal affected by the queens at (0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 2), or (7, 7).\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 4)\n     - (1, 6)\n     - (2, 1)\n     - (3, 5)\n     - (4, 0)\n     - (5, 2)\n     - (6, 3)\n     - (7, 7)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 1 6, 2 1, 3 5, 4 0, 5 2, 6 3, 7 7>>>"
