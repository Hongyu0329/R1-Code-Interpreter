    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place exactly 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty, with no queens placed and no cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Strategy for Placement**:\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in each column.\n   - For each placement, check if it conflicts with any previously placed queens (same column or diagonal).\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row and repeat.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try the next column.\n\n5. **Checking for Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure no other queen is in the same column.\n   - Ensure no other queen is on the same diagonal. Diagonals can be checked using the properties:\n     - For the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), the difference between row and column indices is constant.\n     - For the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), the sum of row and column indices is constant.\n\n6. **Iterate and Place Queens**:\n   - Start placing queens from row 0 to row 7.\n   - Use the backtracking approach to find a valid configuration.\n\n7. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Once all queens are placed without conflicts, output their positions.\n\nGiven the initial empty board, a possible solution is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
