A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We must also respect the constraints of the grid, including the blocked positions marked with 'X'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is already one queen placed at position (0, 2).\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - Row 0: Queen is at (0, 2).\n   - Row 1: Empty.\n   - Row 2: Empty.\n   - Row 3: Blocked at (3, 1).\n   - Row 4: Blocked at (4, 3).\n   - Row 5: Empty.\n   - Row 6: Empty.\n   - Row 7: Blocked at (7, 7).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Start placing queens from row 1 to row 7.\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - Avoid blocked positions.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 4). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queen at (0, 2).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 6). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 2) and (1, 4).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 0). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 6).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 5). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 6), and (3, 0).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 7). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), and (4, 5).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 1). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (4, 5), and (5, 7).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 3). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as the queens at (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (4, 5), (5, 7), and (6, 1).\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 2)\n     - (1, 4)\n     - (2, 6)\n     - (3, 0)\n     - (4, 5)\n     - (5, 7)\n     - (6, 1)\n     - (7, 3)\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 2, 1 4, 2 6, 3 0, 4 5, 5 7, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
