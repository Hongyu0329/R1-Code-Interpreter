    "To solve the problem of placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other, we need to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty, with no queens placed and no cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Strategy for Placement**:\n   - We will place one queen per row.\n   - We will ensure that each queen is placed in a unique column.\n   - We will check diagonals to ensure no two queens threaten each other.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in a column that is not threatened by any previously placed queens.\n   - Move to the next row and repeat the process, ensuring no conflicts in columns or diagonals.\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen without conflict, backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.\n\n5. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore possible placements.\n   - If a placement leads to a conflict, backtrack and try a different position.\n\n6. **Final Placement**:\n   - After successfully placing all 8 queens, record their positions.\n\nGiven that the board is initially empty and there are no 'X' marks, we can proceed with placing the queens using the above strategy.\n\nHere is one possible solution for placing the queens:\n\n- Place a queen at (0, 0)\n- Place a queen at (1, 4)\n- Place a queen at (2, 7)\n- Place a queen at (3, 5)\n- Place a queen at (4, 2)\n- Place a queen at (5, 6)\n- Place a queen at (6, 1)\n- Place a queen at (7, 3)\n\nThis placement ensures that no two queens threaten each other.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
