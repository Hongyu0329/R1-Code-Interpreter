A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - The grid has some cells marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n3. **Current Grid:**\n   ```\n   00000000\n   X00000X0\n   0000X000\n   00000000\n   000X0000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   ```\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - Start from the first row and place a queen in a valid position, then move to the next row.\n\n5. **Row-by-Row Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 1:** The only valid position is (1, 7) because (1, 0) and (1, 6) are blocked by 'X'.\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 5) since (2, 4) is blocked by 'X'.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 2).\n   - **Row 4:** The only valid position is (4, 6) because (4, 3) is blocked by 'X'.\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 1).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 3).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 4).\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nAfter placing the queens as described, the final positions are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 7, 2 5, 3 2, 4 6, 5 1, 6 3, 7 4>>>"
