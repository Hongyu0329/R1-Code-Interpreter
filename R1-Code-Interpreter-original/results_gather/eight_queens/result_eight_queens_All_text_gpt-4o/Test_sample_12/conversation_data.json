    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (2, 7), and position (2, 5) is marked with an 'X', meaning we cannot place a queen there. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - A queen is already placed at (2, 7).\n   - Position (2, 5) is blocked (marked with 'X').\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen at (2, 5).\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 2 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in row 2.\n   - Column 7 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in column 7.\n   - Diagonals passing through (2, 7) are also blocked for other queens.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 7).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 2). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0) or (2, 7).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 4). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 2), or (2, 7).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 6). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 7), or (3, 4).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 1). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 7), (3, 4), or (4, 6).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 3). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 7), (3, 4), (4, 6), or (5, 1).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 5). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 7), (3, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), or (6, 3).\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure that all queens are placed correctly without threatening each other.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 7, 3 4, 4 6, 5 1, 6 3, 7 5>>>"
