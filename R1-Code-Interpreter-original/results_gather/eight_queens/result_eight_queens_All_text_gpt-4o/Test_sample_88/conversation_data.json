A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. We also need to respect the positions marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the given board:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nFrom the board, we can see that there are already two queens placed at positions (3, 2) and (6, 7).\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Queens**: Rows 3 and 6 already have queens.\n\n2. **Identify Columns with Queens**: Columns 2 and 7 already have queens.\n\n3. **Identify Diagonals with Queens**:\n   - The queen at (3, 2) affects diagonals: (2, 1), (1, 0), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6).\n   - The queen at (6, 7) affects diagonals: (5, 6), (4, 5), (3, 4), (2, 3), (1, 2), (0, 1), (7, 6).\n\n4. **Place Queens in Remaining Rows**:\n   - **Row 0**: Cannot place in columns 2, 7, or 1 (diagonal conflict). Place at (0, 4).\n   - **Row 1**: Cannot place in columns 2, 7, or 1 (diagonal conflict). Place at (1, 6).\n   - **Row 2**: Cannot place in columns 2, 7, or 3 (diagonal conflict). Place at (2, 5).\n   - **Row 4**: Cannot place in columns 2, 7, or 3 (diagonal conflict). Place at (4, 0).\n   - **Row 5**: Cannot place in columns 2, 7, or 4 (diagonal conflict). Place at (5, 3).\n   - **Row 7**: Cannot place in columns 2, 7, or 6 (diagonal conflict). Place at (7, 1).\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure no two queens threaten each other. Each row, column, and diagonal should have only one queen.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n- (0, 4)\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 2)\n- (4, 0)\n- (5, 3)\n- (6, 7)\n- (7, 1)\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 4, 1 6, 2 5, 3 2, 4 0, 5 3, 6 7, 7 1>>>"
