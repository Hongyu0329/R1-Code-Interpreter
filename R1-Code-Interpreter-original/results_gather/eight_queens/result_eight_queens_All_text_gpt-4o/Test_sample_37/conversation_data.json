    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other, and no queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Cells marked with '1' already have a queen.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Current Grid Status:**\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 X 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 X 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 X 0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Queens Already Placed:**\n   - There is one queen placed at position (3, 6).\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - No queen can be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 4) (no conflict with existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 7) (no conflict with existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 0) (no conflict with existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 3:** Already has a queen at (3, 6).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 1) (no conflict with existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 3) (no conflict with existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 5) (no conflict with existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 2) (no conflict with existing queens or 'X').\n\n7. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 4)\n     - (1, 7)\n     - (2, 0)\n     - (3, 6)\n     - (4, 1)\n     - (5, 3)\n     - (6, 5)\n     - (7, 2)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 1 7, 2 0, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 2>>>"
