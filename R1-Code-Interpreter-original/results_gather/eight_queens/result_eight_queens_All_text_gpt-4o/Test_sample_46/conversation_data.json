  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have some constraints due to the positions marked with 'X' and the queens already placed. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Queens are already placed at positions (1, 2) and (4, 1).\n   - Positions (4, 7) and (7, 2) are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens, and 2 are already placed, so 6 more queens need to be placed.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 1 has a queen at column 2.\n   - Row 4 has a queen at column 1.\n   - Columns 2 and 1 are occupied by queens.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queens at (1, 2) and (4, 1) need to be considered.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place in column 2 (same column as (1, 2)). Try placing in column 4.\n   - **Row 2:** Cannot place in column 2 (same column as (1, 2)). Try placing in column 6.\n   - **Row 3:** Cannot place in column 1 (same column as (4, 1)). Try placing in column 0.\n   - **Row 5:** Cannot place in column 1 (same column as (4, 1)). Try placing in column 3.\n   - **Row 6:** Cannot place in column 1 (same column as (4, 1)). Try placing in column 5.\n   - **Row 7:** Cannot place in column 2 (position marked with 'X'). Try placing in column 7.\n\n5. **Final Placement:**\n   - Row 0: Place queen at column 4.\n   - Row 2: Place queen at column 6.\n   - Row 3: Place queen at column 0.\n   - Row 5: Place queen at column 3.\n   - Row 6: Place queen at column 5.\n   - Row 7: Place queen at column 7.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Check that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 4, 1 2, 2 6, 3 0, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
