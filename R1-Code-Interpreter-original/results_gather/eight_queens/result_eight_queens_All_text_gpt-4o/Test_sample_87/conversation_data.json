  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We must also respect the constraints of the grid, including the blocked positions marked with 'X'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - The grid provided has no queens placed yet, but it has blocked positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Blocked Positions:**\n   - The blocked positions are at (1,4) and (2,6).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on blocked positions.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will avoid placing queens in blocked positions.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0,0). This is the first available position in row 0.\n   - **Row 1:** The blocked position is (1,4). Place a queen at (1,1).\n   - **Row 2:** The blocked position is (2,6). Place a queen at (2,2).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3,3).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4,5).\n   - **Row 5:** The blocked position is (5,4). Place a queen at (5,7).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6,6).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7,4).\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on blocked positions.\n\nAfter placing the queens as described, we have a valid configuration where no two queens threaten each other, and no queens are placed on blocked positions.\n\nThe final answer with the positions of the queens is:\n<<<0 0, 1 1, 2 2, 3 3, 4 5, 5 7, 6 6, 7 4>>>"
