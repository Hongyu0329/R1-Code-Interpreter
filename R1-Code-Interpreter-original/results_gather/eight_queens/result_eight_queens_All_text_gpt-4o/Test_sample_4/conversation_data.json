    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (2,0). Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - A queen is already placed at (2,0).\n   - We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens. However, in this problem, there are no 'X' positions given.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will start from the top row and move downwards, checking each row for a valid position.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - **Row 0**: \n     - The queen in row 2 blocks column 0 and its diagonals.\n     - Place a queen at (0,1) (first available column not blocked by the queen at (2,0)).\n\n   - **Row 1**:\n     - The queen in row 2 blocks column 0 and its diagonals.\n     - Place a queen at (1,3) (first available column not blocked by the queens at (0,1) and (2,0)).\n\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Already has a queen at (2,0).\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - The queens in rows 0, 1, and 2 block columns 0, 1, and 3, and their diagonals.\n     - Place a queen at (3,5).\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - The queens in rows 0, 1, 2, and 3 block columns 0, 1, 3, and 5, and their diagonals.\n     - Place a queen at (4,7).\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - The queens in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 block columns 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, and their diagonals.\n     - Place a queen at (5,2).\n\n   - **Row 6**:\n     - The queens in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 block columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and their diagonals.\n     - Place a queen at (6,4).\n\n   - **Row 7**:\n     - The queens in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 block columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, and their diagonals.\n     - Place a queen at (7,6).\n\n5. **Final Placement**:\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions: (0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,5), (4,7), (5,2), (6,4), (7,6).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 1 3, 2 0, 3 5, 4 7, 5 2, 6 4, 7 6>>>"
