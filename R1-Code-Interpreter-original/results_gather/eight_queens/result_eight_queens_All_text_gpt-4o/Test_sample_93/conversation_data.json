  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n000000X0\n0000X000\n00000000\n0X001000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. We will analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state:**\n   - The board is an 8x8 grid.\n   - Cells marked with '1' have a queen placed.\n   - Cells marked with '0' are empty.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Current board analysis:**\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 X 0\n   0 0 0 0 X 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 X 0 0 1 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Queens already placed:**\n   - There is one queen placed at position (4, 4).\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place 7 more queens.\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n6. **Step-by-step placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 2). This column and diagonals are free.\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 5). This column and diagonals are free.\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 7). This column and diagonals are free.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 0). This column and diagonals are free.\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 6). This column and diagonals are free.\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 3). This column and diagonals are free.\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 1). This column and diagonals are free.\n\n7. **Final placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 2)\n     - (1, 5)\n     - (2, 7)\n     - (3, 0)\n     - (4, 4) (already placed)\n     - (5, 6)\n     - (6, 3)\n     - (7, 1)\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 2, 1 5, 2 7, 3 0, 4 4, 5 6, 6 3, 7 1>>>"
