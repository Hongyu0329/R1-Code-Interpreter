  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (0, 7), and we cannot place a queen in the cell marked with 'X' at position (4, 1).\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - A queen is already placed at (0, 7).\n   - The cell (4, 1) is marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status**:\n   - Row 0: Queen at (0, 7).\n   - Row 4: Cell (4, 1) is blocked.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (1 to 7).\n   - We must ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1, 3). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 7).\n   - **Row 2**: Place a queen at (2, 5). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 7) or (1, 3).\n   - **Row 3**: Place a queen at (3, 0). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 7), (1, 3), or (2, 5).\n   - **Row 4**: Place a queen at (4, 6). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 7), (1, 3), (2, 5), or (3, 0).\n   - **Row 5**: Place a queen at (5, 2). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 7), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), or (4, 6).\n   - **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6, 4). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 7), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (4, 6), or (5, 2).\n   - **Row 7**: Place a queen at (7, 1). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 7), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (4, 6), (5, 2), or (6, 4).\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 7, 1 3, 2 5, 3 0, 4 6, 5 2, 6 4, 7 1>>>"
