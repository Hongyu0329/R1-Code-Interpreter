A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. No two queens can be in the same row.\n2. No two queens can be in the same column.\n3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n4. Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's analyze the given board:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nFrom the board, we see that:\n- A queen is already placed at (1, 5).\n- A queen is already placed at (7, 0).\n\nWe need to place 6 more queens on the board. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \n   - Columns 5 and 0 are already occupied by queens in other rows.\n   - We can place a queen at (0, 2).\n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - Columns 0, 2, and 5 are already occupied by queens in other rows.\n   - We can place a queen at (2, 4).\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - Columns 0, 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied by queens in other rows.\n   - We can place a queen at (3, 6).\n\n4. **Row 4**:\n   - Columns 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are already occupied by queens in other rows.\n   - We can place a queen at (4, 1).\n\n5. **Row 5**:\n   - Columns 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are already occupied by queens in other rows.\n   - We can place a queen at (5, 3).\n\n6. **Row 6**:\n   - Columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are already occupied by queens in other rows.\n   - We can place a queen at (6, 7).\n\nNow, we have placed all 8 queens on the board without any two queens threatening each other.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n- (0, 2)\n- (1, 5)\n- (2, 4)\n- (3, 6)\n- (4, 1)\n- (5, 3)\n- (6, 7)\n- (7, 0)\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 5, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 7, 7 0>>>"
