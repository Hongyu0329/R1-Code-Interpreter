A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row.\n   - No two queens can be in the same column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal (both major and minor diagonals).\n\n3. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - Row 0: 000000X0\n   - Row 1: 00000000\n   - Row 2: 00000000\n   - Row 3: 00000000\n   - Row 4: X0000000\n   - Row 5: 00000000\n   - Row 6: 00000000\n   - Row 7: 0000000X\n\n4. **Placing Queens**:\n   - We need to place one queen in each row.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - **Row 0**: The only available positions are columns 0 to 5 and 7. Choose column 0 for the queen.\n   - **Row 1**: Avoid column 0. Choose column 2 for the queen.\n   - **Row 2**: Avoid columns 0 and 2. Choose column 4 for the queen.\n   - **Row 3**: Avoid columns 0, 2, and 4. Choose column 6 for the queen.\n   - **Row 4**: Avoid columns 0, 2, 4, and 6. Choose column 1 for the queen.\n   - **Row 5**: Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. Choose column 3 for the queen.\n   - **Row 6**: Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Choose column 5 for the queen.\n   - **Row 7**: Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The only available position is column 7.\n\n6. **Final Placement**:\n   - Row 0, Column 0\n   - Row 1, Column 2\n   - Row 2, Column 4\n   - Row 3, Column 6\n   - Row 4, Column 1\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 5\n   - Row 7, Column 7\n\nThe queens are placed such that no two queens threaten each other, and no queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
