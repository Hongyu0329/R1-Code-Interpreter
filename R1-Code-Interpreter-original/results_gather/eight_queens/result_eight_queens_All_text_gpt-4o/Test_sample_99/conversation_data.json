    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - The grid has two 'X' marks at positions (3,3) and (5,1), which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We start with an empty board, as no queens are initially placed.\n   - We need to place one queen in each row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - Avoid columns and diagonals that intersect with 'X' positions.\n   - Ensure each row has exactly one queen.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - **Row 0**: Place a queen at (0,0). This is a safe position as no other queens are placed yet.\n   - **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1,2). This avoids the column and diagonals of the queen at (0,0).\n   - **Row 2**: Place a queen at (2,4). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens at (0,0) and (1,2).\n   - **Row 3**: Place a queen at (3,6). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens at (0,0), (1,2), and (2,4), and also avoids the 'X' at (3,3).\n   - **Row 4**: Place a queen at (4,1). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens at (0,0), (1,2), (2,4), and (3,6).\n   - **Row 5**: Place a queen at (5,7). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens at (0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), and (4,1), and also avoids the 'X' at (5,1).\n   - **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6,3). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens at (0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,1), and (5,7).\n   - **Row 7**: Place a queen at (7,5). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens at (0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,1), (5,7), and (6,3).\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nAfter following these steps, the queens are placed as follows:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 7, 6 3, 7 5>>>"
