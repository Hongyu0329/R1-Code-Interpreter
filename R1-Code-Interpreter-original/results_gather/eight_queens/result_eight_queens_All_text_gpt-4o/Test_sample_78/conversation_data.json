    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. The grid already has one queen placed at position (2, 6). We need to place seven more queens.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n   - We need to place a total of eight queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we have one queen at (2, 6).\n   - We need to find positions for the remaining seven queens.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by placing queens row by row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - Use backtracking to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 6).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 4). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0) or (2, 6).\n   - **Row 2:** Already has a queen at (2, 6).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 1). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 4), or (2, 6).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 7). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), or (3, 1).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 3). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), or (4, 7).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 5). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 7), or (5, 3).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 2). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 7), (5, 3), or (6, 5).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - All queens are placed in valid positions.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 6, 3 1, 4 7, 5 3, 6 5, 7 2>>>"
