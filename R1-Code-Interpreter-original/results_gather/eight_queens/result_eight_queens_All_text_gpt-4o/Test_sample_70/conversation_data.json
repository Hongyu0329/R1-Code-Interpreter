    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (1, 0), and we have restrictions on certain cells marked with 'X'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - A queen is already placed at (1, 0).\n   - Cells (0, 2) and (2, 6) are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 1 already has a queen at column 0.\n   - Column 0 is occupied by a queen.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queen at (1, 0) are:\n     - Descending diagonal: (0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)\n     - Ascending diagonal: (0, -1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n   - Avoid columns and diagonals already occupied or threatened by existing queens.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place in column 0 (occupied by (1, 0)), column 2 (X), or column 1 (diagonal threat). Place at column 3.\n   - **Row 2:** Cannot place in column 0 (occupied by (1, 0)), column 6 (X), or column 1 (diagonal threat). Place at column 4.\n   - **Row 3:** Cannot place in column 0 (occupied by (1, 0)), column 2 (diagonal threat), or column 4 (diagonal threat). Place at column 5.\n   - **Row 4:** Cannot place in column 0 (occupied by (1, 0)), column 3 (diagonal threat), or column 5 (diagonal threat). Place at column 6.\n   - **Row 5:** Cannot place in column 0 (occupied by (1, 0)), column 4 (diagonal threat), or column 6 (diagonal threat). Place at column 7.\n   - **Row 6:** Cannot place in column 0 (occupied by (1, 0)), column 5 (diagonal threat), or column 7 (diagonal threat). Place at column 2.\n   - **Row 7:** Cannot place in column 0 (occupied by (1, 0)), column 6 (diagonal threat), or column 2 (diagonal threat). Place at column 1.\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - Row 0: Column 3\n   - Row 1: Column 0 (already placed)\n   - Row 2: Column 4\n   - Row 3: Column 5\n   - Row 4: Column 6\n   - Row 5: Column 7\n   - Row 6: Column 2\n   - Row 7: Column 1\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4, 3 5, 4 6, 5 7, 6 2, 7 1>>>"
