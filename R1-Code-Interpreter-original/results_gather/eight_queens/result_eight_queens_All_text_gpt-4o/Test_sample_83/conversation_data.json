A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have two queens placed on the board, and we need to place six more. Let's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   - The board is represented as an 8x8 grid.\n   - A '1' indicates a queen is placed, and a '0' indicates an empty cell.\n   - The initial board has queens at positions (0, 4) and (4, 7).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens. However, in this problem, there are no 'X' marks, so we can ignore this constraint.\n\n3. **Current Queen Positions:**\n   - (0, 4): This queen occupies row 0, column 4, and its diagonals.\n   - (4, 7): This queen occupies row 4, column 7, and its diagonals.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - We must ensure that no two queens share the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 1:** The available columns are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Place a queen at (1, 0).\n   - **Row 2:** The available columns are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Place a queen at (2, 5).\n   - **Row 3:** The available columns are 1, 2, 3, 6. Place a queen at (3, 1).\n   - **Row 5:** The available columns are 2, 3, 6. Place a queen at (5, 2).\n   - **Row 6:** The available columns are 3, 6. Place a queen at (6, 3).\n   - **Row 7:** The only available column is 6. Place a queen at (7, 6).\n\n6. **Final Queen Positions:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions: (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (3, 1), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 3), (7, 6).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 1 0, 2 5, 3 1, 4 7, 5 2, 6 3, 7 6>>>"
