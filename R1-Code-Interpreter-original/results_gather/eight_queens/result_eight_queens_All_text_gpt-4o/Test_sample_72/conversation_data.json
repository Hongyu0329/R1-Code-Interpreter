A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal, and we must avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is already one queen placed at position (0, 1).\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid positions marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - Row 0 has a queen at column 1.\n   - Row 2 has a restricted position at column 6.\n   - Row 6 has restricted positions at columns 2 and 3.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, starting from row 1 to row 7.\n   - We will ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Queen is already placed at (0, 1).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 3). This column and diagonals are not threatened by the queen at (0, 1).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 5). Avoid column 6 due to 'X' and ensure no diagonal threats.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 7). This position is safe from previous queens.\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 0). This position is safe from previous queens.\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 2). This position is safe from previous queens.\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 4). Avoid columns 2 and 3 due to 'X' and ensure no diagonal threats.\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 6). This position is safe from previous queens.\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nAfter placing the queens as described, the board is complete with no two queens threatening each other.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 1, 1 3, 2 5, 3 7, 4 0, 5 2, 6 4, 7 6>>>"
