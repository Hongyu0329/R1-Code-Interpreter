    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as not placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the current positions of the queens:**\n   - The board is given as:\n     ```\n     00000000\n     000000X0\n     00000000\n     00000X01\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     0000X0X0\n     00000000\n     ```\n   - From this, we can see there is a queen at position (3, 6).\n\n2. **Identify the restricted positions:**\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens:\n     - (1, 6)\n     - (3, 5)\n     - (6, 4)\n     - (6, 6)\n\n3. **Determine the available rows for placing queens:**\n   - Since there are 8 rows and we need to place 8 queens, each row must have exactly one queen.\n   - Row 3 already has a queen, so we need to place queens in the remaining rows: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n4. **Determine the available columns for placing queens:**\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column. Since there is already a queen in column 6, we cannot place another queen in this column.\n\n5. **Consider diagonal constraints:**\n   - Queens cannot be placed on the same diagonal. This includes both the main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left).\n\n6. **Place the remaining queens:**\n   - We will place queens in the available rows and columns while respecting the diagonal constraints and avoiding restricted positions.\n\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 2).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 4).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 1).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 3).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 7).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 5).\n\nBy placing the queens in these positions, we ensure that no two queens can attack each other, and all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 7, 7 5>>>"
