    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Let's analyze the given board and determine the positions of the queens and the constraints:\n\n1. **Initial Board Analysis:**\n   - The board is represented as an 8x8 grid.\n   - The given board is:\n     ```\n     00000000\n     00100000\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     00001000\n     10000000\n     00000000\n     ```\n   - From this, we can identify the positions of the queens:\n     - Queen at (1, 2)\n     - Queen at (5, 4)\n     - Queen at (6, 0)\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens. However, in this problem, there are no 'X' marks, so we don't have this constraint.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - We already have queens in rows 1, 5, and 6. Therefore, we need to place queens in the remaining rows: 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7.\n   - We also need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n4. **Placing Queens:**\n   - **Row 0:** The only available column that is not attacked by existing queens is column 4. Place a queen at (0, 4).\n   - **Row 2:** The only available column that is not attacked by existing queens is column 6. Place a queen at (2, 6).\n   - **Row 3:** The only available column that is not attacked by existing queens is column 1. Place a queen at (3, 1).\n   - **Row 4:** The only available column that is not attacked by existing queens is column 7. Place a queen at (4, 7).\n   - **Row 7:** The only available column that is not attacked by existing queens is column 3. Place a queen at (7, 3).\n\n5. **Final Placement:**\n   - The final positions of the queens are:\n     - (0, 4)\n     - (1, 2)\n     - (2, 6)\n     - (3, 1)\n     - (4, 7)\n     - (5, 4)\n     - (6, 0)\n     - (7, 3)\n\nThe queens are placed such that no two queens threaten each other, satisfying all the constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0 4, 1 2, 2 6, 3 1, 4 7, 5 4, 6 0, 7 3>>>"
