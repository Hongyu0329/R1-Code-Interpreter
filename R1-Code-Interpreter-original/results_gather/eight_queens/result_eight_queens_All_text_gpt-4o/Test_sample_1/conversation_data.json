    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (2, 3). Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 grid with a queen at position (2, 3). We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row.\n   - No two queens can be in the same column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\n3. **Current Board Status**:\n   - Row 2 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in row 2.\n   - Column 3 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in column 3.\n   - The diagonals passing through (2, 3) are also restricted.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will start placing queens from row 0 to row 7, skipping row 2 since it already has a queen.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - **Row 0**: Place a queen at (0, 5). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3).\n   - **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1, 7). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3) or (0, 5).\n   - **Row 3**: Place a queen at (3, 0). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3), (0, 5), or (1, 7).\n   - **Row 4**: Place a queen at (4, 6). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 5**: Place a queen at (5, 2). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6, 4). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 7**: Place a queen at (7, 1). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as any previously placed queens.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The chosen positions satisfy all constraints.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 5, 1 7, 2 3, 3 0, 4 6, 5 2, 6 4, 7 1>>>"
