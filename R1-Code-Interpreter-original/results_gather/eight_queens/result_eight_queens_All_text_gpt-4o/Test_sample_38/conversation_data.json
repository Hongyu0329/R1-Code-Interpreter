    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have some constraints: no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n1. **Identify the current positions of the queens:**\n   - Row 1, Column 0\n   - Row 5, Column 1\n\n2. **Mark the restricted positions:**\n   - Row 2, Column 0 is marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\n3. **Determine the available rows for placing queens:**\n   - Rows 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are available for placing queens since they currently have no queens.\n\n4. **Determine the available columns for placing queens:**\n   - Columns 0 and 1 are already occupied by queens.\n   - Columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are available.\n\n5. **Place queens in the available rows and columns while ensuring no two queens threaten each other:**\n\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen in Column 2 (since Columns 0 and 1 are occupied, and Column 2 is the first available column).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen in Column 4 (Columns 0, 1, and 2 are occupied, and Column 4 is the next available column).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen in Column 6 (Columns 0, 1, 2, and 4 are occupied, and Column 6 is the next available column).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen in Column 3 (Columns 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 are occupied, and Column 3 is the next available column).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen in Column 5 (Columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are occupied, and Column 5 is the next available column).\n\n6. **Verify the placement:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The placement should satisfy all constraints.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 0, 3 4, 4 6, 5 1, 6 3, 7 5>>>"
