    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the given board:\n\n```\n00000000\n00000000\n000000X0\n0X0000X0\n00000000\n00000000\n0X000000\n00000000\n```\n\n1. **Identify Constraints:**\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to place exactly one queen in each row and each column.\n   - Queens must not be placed on the same diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Observations:**\n   - The board has no queens placed initially, so we have full freedom to start placing queens.\n   - We need to avoid the 'X' positions: (2,6), (3,1), (3,6), and (6,1).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - Start placing queens row by row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - Use backtracking to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Placement Strategy:**\n   - Row 0: Place a queen at (0,0).\n   - Row 1: Place a queen at (1,2).\n   - Row 2: Place a queen at (2,4).\n   - Row 3: Place a queen at (3,7).\n   - Row 4: Place a queen at (4,1).\n   - Row 5: Place a queen at (5,3).\n   - Row 6: Place a queen at (6,5).\n   - Row 7: Place a queen at (7,6).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nAfter following these steps, the queens are placed as follows:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 7, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 6>>>"
