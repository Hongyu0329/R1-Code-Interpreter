A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We must also respect the constraints of the grid, including the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is one queen already placed at position (1, 3).\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - Row 1 already has a queen at column 3.\n   - Positions (0, 7) and (5, 0) are marked with 'X' and cannot have queens.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will avoid placing queens in columns or diagonals that are already threatened by existing queens.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place at column 7 due to 'X'. Place at column 0.\n   - **Row 1:** Already has a queen at column 3.\n   - **Row 2:** Avoid column 0 (threatened by (0, 0)) and column 3 (threatened by (1, 3)). Place at column 5.\n   - **Row 3:** Avoid columns 0, 3, and 5. Place at column 7.\n   - **Row 4:** Avoid columns 0, 3, 5, and 7. Place at column 2.\n   - **Row 5:** Avoid columns 0 (due to 'X'), 2, 3, 5, and 7. Place at column 6.\n   - **Row 6:** Avoid columns 0, 2 (due to 'X'), 3, 5, 6, and 7. Place at column 4.\n   - **Row 7:** Avoid columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Place at column 1.\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - Row 0: Column 0\n   - Row 1: Column 3\n   - Row 2: Column 5\n   - Row 3: Column 7\n   - Row 4: Column 2\n   - Row 5: Column 6\n   - Row 6: Column 4\n   - Row 7: Column 1\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 3, 2 5, 3 7, 4 2, 5 6, 6 4, 7 1>>>"
