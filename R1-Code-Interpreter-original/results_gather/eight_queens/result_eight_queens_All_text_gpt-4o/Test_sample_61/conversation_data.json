    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the grid, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used for placing queens.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is initially empty except for the 'X' marks.\n   - The 'X' marks are at positions (3,4), (4,6), and (6,1).\n\n3. **Strategy for Placing Queens:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will avoid placing queens in positions marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0,0). This is the first available position in row 0.\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1,2). This avoids the column and diagonal of the queen in row 0.\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2,4). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens in rows 0 and 1.\n   - **Row 3:** The position (3,4) is marked with 'X'. Place a queen at (3,6).\n   - **Row 4:** The position (4,6) is marked with 'X'. Place a queen at (4,1).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5,3). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens in previous rows.\n   - **Row 6:** The position (6,1) is marked with 'X'. Place a queen at (6,5).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7,7). This avoids the columns and diagonals of the queens in previous rows.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure that no queens are placed in positions marked with 'X'.\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully place all eight queens on the board without any conflicts.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
