    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the given board:\n\n```\nRow 0: 00000000\nRow 1: X0X000X0\nRow 2: 00000000\nRow 3: 00000000\nRow 4: 00000000\nRow 5: 00000000\nRow 6: 00000000\nRow 7: 00X00000\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints:**\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to place exactly one queen in each row and each column.\n   - Queens must not be placed on the same diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Placement:**\n   - Start placing queens row by row, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.\n\n3. **Row 0:**\n   - Place a queen at (0, 0).\n\n4. **Row 1:**\n   - Avoid positions (1, 0), (1, 2), and (1, 6) due to 'X'.\n   - Place a queen at (1, 4).\n\n5. **Row 2:**\n   - Avoid column 0 and column 4 due to existing queens.\n   - Place a queen at (2, 6).\n\n6. **Row 3:**\n   - Avoid columns 0, 4, and 6 due to existing queens.\n   - Place a queen at (3, 1).\n\n7. **Row 4:**\n   - Avoid columns 0, 1, 4, and 6 due to existing queens.\n   - Place a queen at (4, 3).\n\n8. **Row 5:**\n   - Avoid columns 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6 due to existing queens.\n   - Place a queen at (5, 7).\n\n9. **Row 6:**\n   - Avoid columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 due to existing queens.\n   - Place a queen at (6, 2).\n\n10. **Row 7:**\n    - Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 due to existing queens.\n    - Place a queen at (7, 5).\n\n### Final Placement:\n\nThe queens are placed at the following positions:\n\n- Row 0, Column 0\n- Row 1, Column 4\n- Row 2, Column 6\n- Row 3, Column 1\n- Row 4, Column 3\n- Row 5, Column 7\n- Row 6, Column 2\n- Row 7, Column 5\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 6, 3 1, 4 3, 5 7, 6 2, 7 5>>>"
