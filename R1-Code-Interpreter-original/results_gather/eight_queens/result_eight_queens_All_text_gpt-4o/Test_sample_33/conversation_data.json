    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (0, 5). Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - A queen is already placed at (0, 5).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens. However, in the given grid, there are no 'X' marks, so we don't have to worry about this constraint.\n\n3. **Current Board State:**\n   - Row 0: Queen at column 5.\n   - Rows 1 to 7: Empty.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (1 to 7).\n   - Ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Columns available: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 (column 5 is blocked by the queen at (0, 5)).\n     - Place a queen at (1, 0).\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Columns available: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 (columns 0 and 5 are blocked).\n     - Place a queen at (2, 3).\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Columns available: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (columns 0, 3, and 5 are blocked).\n     - Place a queen at (3, 7).\n\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - Columns available: 1, 2, 4, 6 (columns 0, 3, 5, and 7 are blocked).\n     - Place a queen at (4, 2).\n\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Columns available: 1, 4, 6 (columns 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are blocked).\n     - Place a queen at (5, 6).\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Columns available: 1, 4 (columns 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are blocked).\n     - Place a queen at (6, 1).\n\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - Columns available: 4 (columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are blocked).\n     - Place a queen at (7, 4).\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 3), (3, 7), (4, 2), (5, 6), (6, 1), (7, 4).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 5, 1 0, 2 3, 3 7, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 4>>>"
