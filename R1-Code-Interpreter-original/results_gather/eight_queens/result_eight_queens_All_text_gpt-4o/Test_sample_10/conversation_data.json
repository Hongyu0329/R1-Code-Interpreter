    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (4, 5), and we cannot place any queen at position (5, 5) because it is marked with an 'X'. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - A queen is already placed at (4, 5).\n   - Position (5, 5) is blocked and cannot be used.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 4 already has a queen.\n   - Column 5 is occupied by a queen.\n   - Diagonals passing through (4, 5) are occupied.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7).\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (4, 5).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 2). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (4, 5) or (0, 0).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 4). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (4, 5), (0, 0), or (1, 2).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 6). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (4, 5), (0, 0), (1, 2), or (2, 4).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 7). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (4, 5), (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), or (3, 6).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 1). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (4, 5), (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), or (5, 7).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 3). This position is not in the same column or diagonal as (4, 5), (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (5, 7), or (6, 1).\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure all queens are placed in valid positions.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 5, 5 7, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
