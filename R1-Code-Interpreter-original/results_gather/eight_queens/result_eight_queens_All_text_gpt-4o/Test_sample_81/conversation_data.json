    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and certain positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's analyze the given board:\n\n```\n00000000\n0000X000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00X00000\n00000000\n```\n\n1. **Identify Forbidden Positions:**\n   - (1, 4) and (6, 2) are marked with 'X' and cannot have queens placed on them.\n\n2. **Determine Initial Queen Placement:**\n   - Currently, there are no queens placed on the board (all cells are marked with 0).\n\n3. **Plan the Placement:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will start placing queens from the top row to the bottom row, checking each column for a valid position.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 1:** The position (1, 4) is forbidden. Place a queen at (1, 1).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 2).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 5).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 3).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 7).\n   - **Row 6:** The position (6, 2) is forbidden. Place a queen at (6, 6).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 4).\n\n5. **Verify the Placement:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Check that no queens are placed in forbidden positions.\n\nAfter following these steps, the queens are placed at the following positions:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 1, 2 2, 3 5, 4 3, 5 7, 6 6, 7 4>>>"
