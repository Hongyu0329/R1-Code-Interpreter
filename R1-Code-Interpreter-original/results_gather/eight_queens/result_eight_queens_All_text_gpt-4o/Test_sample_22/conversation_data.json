    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the restriction that no queen can be placed in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is one queen already placed at position (1, 4).\n   - There is a restriction at position (3, 0) marked with 'X', where no queen can be placed.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen at (3, 0).\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 1 already has a queen at column 4.\n   - Column 4 is occupied by a queen.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queen at (1, 4) are:\n     - Major diagonal: (0, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7)\n     - Minor diagonal: (0, 5), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0)\n\n4. **Strategy for Placing Remaining Queens:**\n   - Start placing queens row by row, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.\n   - Avoid placing queens in columns, rows, or diagonals already occupied or threatened by existing queens.\n   - Avoid the restricted position (3, 0).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 6) (not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 0) (not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 7) (not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen and not at (3, 0)).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 2) (not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 5) (not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 1) (not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 3) (not in the same column, row, or diagonal as any other queen).\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions:\n     - (0, 6)\n     - (1, 4)\n     - (2, 0)\n     - (3, 7)\n     - (4, 2)\n     - (5, 5)\n     - (6, 1)\n     - (7, 3)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 6, 1 4, 2 0, 3 7, 4 2, 5 5, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
