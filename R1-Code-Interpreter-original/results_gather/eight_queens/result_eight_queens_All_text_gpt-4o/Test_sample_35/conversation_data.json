  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n10000000\n00010000\n0000X000\n00000000\n00000000\n0000000X\n000X0000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means queens are placed at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. We have to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal, and we must avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 X 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X\n   0 0 0 X 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Queens Already Placed:**\n   - Row 1, Column 0\n   - Row 2, Column 3\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - No queens can be placed in Row 1 or Row 2.\n   - No queens can be placed in Column 0 or Column 3.\n   - No queens can be placed on diagonals intersecting with (1,0) and (2,3).\n   - No queens can be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place in Column 0 or 3. Place in Column 5.\n   - **Row 3:** Cannot place in Column 3 or 4. Place in Column 7.\n   - **Row 4:** Cannot place in Column 0, 3, 5, or 7. Place in Column 2.\n   - **Row 5:** Cannot place in Column 0, 2, 3, 5, or 7. Place in Column 6.\n   - **Row 6:** Cannot place in Column 0, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Place in Column 1.\n   - **Row 7:** Cannot place in Column 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Place in Column 4.\n\n5. **Final Board with Queens:**\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 X 0 0 1\n   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n   0 1 0 0 0 0 0 X\n   0 0 0 X 1 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Queen Positions:**\n   - Row 0, Column 5\n   - Row 1, Column 0\n   - Row 2, Column 3\n   - Row 3, Column 7\n   - Row 4, Column 2\n   - Row 5, Column 6\n   - Row 6, Column 1\n   - Row 7, Column 4\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 5, 1 0, 2 3, 3 7, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 4>>>"
