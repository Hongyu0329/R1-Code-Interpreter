    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have one queen placed at position (4, 0). Additionally, we have a restricted position marked with 'X' at (0, 7) and (5, 4), where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is a queen at (4, 0).\n   - Positions (0, 7) and (5, 4) are restricted.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 4 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in row 4.\n   - Column 0 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in column 0.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queen at (4, 0) are:\n     - Main diagonal: (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4), (5, -1), (6, -2), (7, -3)\n     - Anti-diagonal: (3, -1), (2, -2), (1, -3), (0, -4), (5, 1), (6, 2), (7, 3)\n\n4. **Placing Remaining Queens:**\n   - We need to place queens in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 5) (since (0, 7) is restricted and (0, 4) is on the diagonal of (4, 0)).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 7) (since (1, 3) is on the diagonal of (4, 0)).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 6) (since (2, 2) is on the diagonal of (4, 0)).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 2) (since (3, 1) is on the diagonal of (4, 0)).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 6) (since (5, 4) is restricted).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 4).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 3).\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure all queens are placed in allowed positions.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 5, 1 7, 2 6, 3 2, 4 0, 5 6, 6 4, 7 3>>>"
