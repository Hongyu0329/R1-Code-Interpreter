A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We must also respect the constraints of the grid, including the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - Some positions are marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n   - We need to ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - Row 0: XX000000\n   - Row 1: 0000010X (Queen at column 5)\n   - Row 2: 00000000\n   - Row 3: 00000000\n   - Row 4: 00000001 (Queen at column 7)\n   - Row 5: 00000000\n   - Row 6: 00000000\n   - Row 7: 00X00000\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Queens are already placed at (1, 5) and (4, 7).\n   - Positions (0, 0), (0, 1), and (7, 2) are marked with 'X' and cannot have queens.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - We must ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place in columns 0, 1 (due to 'X'). Place queen at column 2.\n   - **Row 2:** Avoid columns 2, 5, 7 (due to existing queens and diagonals). Place queen at column 3.\n   - **Row 3:** Avoid columns 2, 3, 5, 7. Place queen at column 0.\n   - **Row 5:** Avoid columns 0, 2, 3, 5, 7. Place queen at column 6.\n   - **Row 6:** Avoid columns 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Place queen at column 4.\n   - **Row 7:** Avoid columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Place queen at column 1.\n\n6. **Final Placement:**\n   - Row 0: Queen at column 2\n   - Row 2: Queen at column 3\n   - Row 3: Queen at column 0\n   - Row 5: Queen at column 6\n   - Row 6: Queen at column 4\n   - Row 7: Queen at column 1\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed in positions marked with 'X'.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 5, 2 3, 3 0, 4 7, 5 6, 6 4, 7 1>>>"
