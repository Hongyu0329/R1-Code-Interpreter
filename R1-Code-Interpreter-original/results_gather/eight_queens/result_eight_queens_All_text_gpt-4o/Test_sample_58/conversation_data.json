    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - The grid provided is:\n     ```\n     00000000\n     000X0000\n     0000000X\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     00000X00\n     00000000\n     00000000\n     ```\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - Start from the first row and proceed to the last row.\n\n4. **Row-by-Row Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 1:** Avoid column 3 due to 'X'. Place a queen at (1, 4).\n   - **Row 2:** Avoid column 7 due to 'X'. Place a queen at (2, 1).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 5).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 2).\n   - **Row 5:** Avoid column 5 due to 'X'. Place a queen at (5, 6).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 3).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 7).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - Check that no queens are placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully placed all 8 queens on the board without any conflicts.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 1, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 3, 7 7>>>"
