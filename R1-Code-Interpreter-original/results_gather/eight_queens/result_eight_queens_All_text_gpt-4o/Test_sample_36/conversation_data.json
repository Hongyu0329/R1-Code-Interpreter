    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the grid, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid Layout**: \n   - The grid is 8x8, and we need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - Some positions are marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We need to identify the positions that are already occupied by queens (marked with '1') and the positions that are blocked (marked with 'X').\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Start placing queens row by row or column by column.\n   - Ensure that each queen placed does not conflict with any previously placed queens.\n   - Use backtracking to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Begin with the first row and try to place a queen in a valid position.\n   - Move to the next row and repeat the process, ensuring no conflicts.\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen without conflict, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n6. **Check for Diagonal Conflicts**:\n   - For each queen placed, ensure that no other queen is on the same diagonal. This can be checked by ensuring that the difference between the row and column indices is unique for each queen.\n\n7. **Final Placement**:\n   - Once all queens are placed without conflict, record their positions.\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: Place a queen at (0, 0).\n- **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1, 2).\n- **Row 2**: The position (2, 3) is blocked, so place a queen at (2, 5).\n- **Row 3**: The position (3, 7) is blocked, so place a queen at (3, 1).\n- **Row 4**: Place a queen at (4, 6).\n- **Row 5**: The position (5, 7) is blocked, so place a queen at (5, 4).\n- **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6, 3).\n- **Row 7**: The position (7, 4) is blocked, so place a queen at (7, 7).\n\nAfter placing the queens, we verify that no two queens threaten each other and that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 5, 3 1, 4 6, 5 4, 6 3, 7 7>>>"
