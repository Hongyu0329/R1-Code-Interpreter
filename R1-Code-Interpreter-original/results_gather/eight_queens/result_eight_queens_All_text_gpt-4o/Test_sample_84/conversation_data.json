    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the grid, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used for placing queens.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints:**\n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is initially empty, with some positions marked as 'X'.\n   - We need to determine the positions of the queens that are already placed, if any.\n\n3. **Strategy for Placement:**\n   - Start placing queens row by row or column by column.\n   - Ensure that each queen placed does not conflict with any previously placed queens.\n   - Avoid positions marked with 'X'.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - Begin with the first row and place a queen in a valid position.\n   - Move to the next row and place a queen in a position that does not conflict with the previous queens.\n   - Continue this process for all rows, ensuring no conflicts in columns or diagonals.\n\n5. **Check for Diagonal Conflicts:**\n   - For each queen placed, ensure that no other queen is on the same diagonal.\n   - Diagonal conflicts can be checked using the difference and sum of row and column indices.\n\n6. **Backtracking:**\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen without conflicts, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position for the queen there.\n\n7. **Final Placement:**\n   - Once all queens are placed without conflicts, verify the solution.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to avoid 'X' positions, let's determine the positions for the queens:\n\n- Row 0: Place a queen at (0, 0).\n- Row 1: Avoid 'X' at (1, 0) and (1, 4). Place a queen at (1, 2).\n- Row 2: Place a queen at (2, 4).\n- Row 3: Place a queen at (3, 6).\n- Row 4: Avoid 'X' at (4, 3). Place a queen at (4, 1).\n- Row 5: Place a queen at (5, 7).\n- Row 6: Place a queen at (6, 3).\n- Row 7: Avoid 'X' at (7, 2). Place a queen at (7, 5).\n\nAfter placing the queens, verify that no two queens threaten each other and that no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\nThe final answer with the positions of the queens is:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 7, 6 3, 7 5>>>"
