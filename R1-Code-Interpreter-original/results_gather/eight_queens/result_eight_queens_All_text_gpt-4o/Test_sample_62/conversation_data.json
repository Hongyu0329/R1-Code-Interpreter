    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - Queens cannot be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The grid is initially empty, with no queens placed and no cells marked with 'X'.\n   - We need to place all 8 queens.\n\n3. **Strategy for Placement**:\n   - Start placing queens row by row or column by column.\n   - For each queen, ensure that it does not share the same row, column, or diagonal with any previously placed queen.\n   - Use backtracking to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Place a queen in the first available position in the first row.\n   - Move to the next row and place a queen in a position that does not conflict with the previous queens.\n   - Continue this process for all rows.\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen without conflict, backtrack to the previous row and move the queen to the next possible position.\n   - Repeat the process until all queens are placed.\n\n5. **Check for Diagonal Conflicts**:\n   - For each queen placed, ensure that no other queen is on the same diagonal.\n   - Diagonals can be checked using the difference and sum of row and column indices.\n\n6. **Final Placement**:\n   - Once all queens are placed without conflict, record their positions.\n\nGiven that the grid is initially empty and there are no 'X' marks, we can proceed with placing the queens using the above strategy.\n\nAfter applying the backtracking approach, the positions of the queens can be determined as follows:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
