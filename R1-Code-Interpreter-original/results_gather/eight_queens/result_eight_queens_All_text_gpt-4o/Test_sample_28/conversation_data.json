  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal, and we must avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - Cells marked with '1' already have queens placed.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n\n2. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - Row 0: 00X00000 (No queen, 'X' at column 2)\n   - Row 1: 01000000 (Queen at column 1)\n   - Row 2: 00000000 (No queen)\n   - Row 3: 0000000X (No queen, 'X' at column 7)\n   - Row 4: 00000000 (No queen)\n   - Row 5: 00000000 (No queen)\n   - Row 6: 00001000 (Queen at column 4)\n   - Row 7: 00000000 (No queen)\n\n3. **Queens Already Placed:**\n   - Row 1, Column 1\n   - Row 6, Column 4\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Place one queen per row.\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same column.\n   - Ensure no two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place in column 2 due to 'X'. Place queen at column 0.\n   - **Row 1:** Already has a queen at column 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 4 (due to existing queens and diagonals). Place queen at column 6.\n   - **Row 3:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 4, 6, 7 (due to existing queens, diagonals, and 'X'). Place queen at column 3.\n   - **Row 4:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 (due to existing queens and diagonals). Place queen at column 5.\n   - **Row 5:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 (due to existing queens and diagonals). Place queen at column 2.\n   - **Row 6:** Already has a queen at column 4.\n   - **Row 7:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (due to existing queens and diagonals). Place queen at column 7.\n\n7. **Final Placement:**\n   - Row 0, Column 0\n   - Row 1, Column 1\n   - Row 2, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 3\n   - Row 4, Column 5\n   - Row 5, Column 2\n   - Row 6, Column 4\n   - Row 7, Column 7\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 1 1, 2 6, 3 3, 4 5, 5 2, 6 4, 7 7>>>"
