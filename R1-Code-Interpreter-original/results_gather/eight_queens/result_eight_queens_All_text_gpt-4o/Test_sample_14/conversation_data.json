    "To solve this problem, we need to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's analyze the given board step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Board Setup:**\n   ```\n   00000000\n   X0000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   00000000\n   000X0000\n   0X000000\n   00000000\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n   - We need to place exactly one queen in each row and each column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0,0). This is a valid position as there are no constraints in this row or column.\n   - **Row 1:** The first cell is 'X', so place a queen at (1,2).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2,4). This position is not attacked by any previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3,6). This position is not attacked by any previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4,1). This position is not attacked by any previously placed queens.\n   - **Row 5:** The fourth cell is 'X', so place a queen at (5,3).\n   - **Row 6:** The second cell is 'X', so place a queen at (6,5).\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7,7). This position is not attacked by any previously placed queens.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X' positions.\n\n5. **Final Placement:**\n   - The queens are placed at the following positions: (0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,1), (5,3), (6,5), (7,7).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
