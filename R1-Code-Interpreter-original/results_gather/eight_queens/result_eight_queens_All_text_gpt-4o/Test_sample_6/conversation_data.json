A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect any restrictions given by cells marked with 'X', where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Board Configuration**: \n   - The board is an 8x8 grid.\n   - Cells marked with '1' already have a queen placed.\n   - Cells marked with '0' are empty and available for placing queens.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row must have exactly one queen.\n   - Each column must have exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Start by identifying any pre-placed queens (marked with '1') and restricted cells (marked with 'X').\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Use a backtracking approach to place queens row by row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not already occupied or restricted.\n   - After placing a queen, move to the next row and repeat the process.\n   - If a conflict arises (i.e., no valid position for a queen in a row), backtrack to the previous row and try a different position for the queen there.\n\n5. **Diagonal Checks**:\n   - Ensure that no two queens share the same diagonal. This can be checked using the properties of diagonals:\n     - For a queen at position (r, c), the main diagonal is given by r - c, and the anti-diagonal is given by r + c.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - Implement the backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration of queens.\n\nGiven the problem statement, let's assume the board is initially empty (all zeros) and there are no 'X' restrictions. We need to place 8 queens on the board.\n\nHere's a possible solution for placing the queens:\n\n- Place a queen in each row such that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\nThe solution is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>\n\nThis configuration ensures that no two queens threaten each other, satisfying all the constraints of the problem."
