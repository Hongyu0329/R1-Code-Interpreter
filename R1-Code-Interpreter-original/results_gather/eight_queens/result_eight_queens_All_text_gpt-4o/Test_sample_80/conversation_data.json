    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the grid, such as the existing queen and the cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is one queen already placed at position (3, 7).\n   - There are 'X' marks at positions (4, 0) and (4, 2), which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n3. **Current Board Status:**\n   - Row 3 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in this row.\n   - Column 7 already has a queen, so no other queen can be placed in this column.\n   - Diagonals affected by the queen at (3, 7) are:\n     - From (3, 7) to (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3).\n     - From (3, 7) to (0, 7), (1, 6), (2, 5), (4, 8), (5, 9), (6, 10), (7, 11) (some of these are out of bounds).\n\n4. **Strategy for Placing Remaining Queens:**\n   - Start placing queens from row 0 to row 7, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.\n   - Avoid columns and diagonals that are already threatened by existing queens.\n   - Avoid positions marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 4) (not threatened by any existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 6) (not threatened by any existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 5) (not threatened by any existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 1) (not threatened by any existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 3) (not threatened by any existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 0) (not threatened by any existing queens or 'X').\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen at (7, 2) (not threatened by any existing queens or 'X').\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensure all queens are placed such that no two queens threaten each other.\n   - Ensure all constraints are respected.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 4, 1 6, 2 5, 3 7, 4 1, 5 3, 6 0, 7 2>>>"
