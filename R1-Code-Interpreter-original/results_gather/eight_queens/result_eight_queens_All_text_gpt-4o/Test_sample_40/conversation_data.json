    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We have some constraints due to the presence of 'X' and the already placed queens. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - '1' indicates a queen is already placed.\n   - '0' indicates an empty cell where a queen can potentially be placed.\n   - 'X' indicates a cell where a queen cannot be placed.\n\n2. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X\n   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n   X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 X 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 X 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Queens Already Placed:**\n   - A queen is placed at (1, 3).\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each row and each column.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Cannot place in column 7 due to 'X'. Place a queen in column 1.\n   - **Row 1:** Already has a queen at column 3.\n   - **Row 2:** Cannot place in column 0 due to 'X'. Place a queen in column 5.\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen in column 7.\n   - **Row 4:** Cannot place in column 2 due to 'X'. Place a queen in column 0.\n   - **Row 5:** Cannot place in column 4 due to 'X'. Place a queen in column 6.\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen in column 2.\n   - **Row 7:** Place a queen in column 4.\n\n7. **Final Placement:**\n   - Row 0: Column 1\n   - Row 1: Column 3 (already placed)\n   - Row 2: Column 5\n   - Row 3: Column 7\n   - Row 4: Column 0\n   - Row 5: Column 6\n   - Row 6: Column 2\n   - Row 7: Column 4\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queens are placed on 'X'.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 1 3, 2 5, 3 7, 4 0, 5 6, 6 2, 7 4>>>"
