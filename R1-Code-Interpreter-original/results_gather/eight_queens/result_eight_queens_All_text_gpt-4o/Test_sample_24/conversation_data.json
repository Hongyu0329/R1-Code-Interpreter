    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. We have an 8x8 grid, and we need to place a total of eight queens. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given board:\n\n```\nRow 0: 000X0000\nRow 1: 00000000\nRow 2: 00000000\nRow 3: 00000000\nRow 4: 0010XX00\nRow 5: 00000000\nRow 6: 00000000\nRow 7: 00000000\n```\n\nFrom the board, we can see:\n- There is a queen already placed at (4, 2).\n\nWe need to place 7 more queens. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Row 0**: We cannot place a queen in column 3 due to 'X'. We can place a queen in column 0, as it does not conflict with the existing queen at (4, 2).\n\n2. **Row 1**: We can place a queen in column 4, as it does not conflict with the queens at (0, 0) and (4, 2).\n\n3. **Row 2**: We can place a queen in column 6, as it does not conflict with the queens at (0, 0), (1, 4), and (4, 2).\n\n4. **Row 3**: We can place a queen in column 1, as it does not conflict with the queens at (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), and (4, 2).\n\n5. **Row 5**: We can place a queen in column 7, as it does not conflict with the queens at (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), and (4, 2).\n\n6. **Row 6**: We can place a queen in column 3, as it does not conflict with the queens at (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 2), and (5, 7).\n\n7. **Row 7**: We can place a queen in column 5, as it does not conflict with the queens at (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 7), and (6, 3).\n\nNow, we have placed all 8 queens on the board without any conflicts.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n- Row 0, Column 0\n- Row 1, Column 4\n- Row 2, Column 6\n- Row 3, Column 1\n- Row 4, Column 2 (already placed)\n- Row 5, Column 7\n- Row 6, Column 3\n- Row 7, Column 5\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 6, 3 1, 4 2, 5 7, 6 3, 7 5>>>"
