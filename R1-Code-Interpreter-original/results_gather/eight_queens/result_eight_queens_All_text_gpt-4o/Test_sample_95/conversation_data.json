    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid:\n\n```\n0X000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000X00\n000000X0\n```\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - We cannot place a queen in any cell marked with 'X'.\n   - We need to place exactly one queen in each row and each column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial placement:**\n   - The grid is initially empty except for the 'X' marks. We need to place all 8 queens.\n\n3. **Step-by-step placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** The only available position is (0, 0) since (0, 1) is blocked by 'X'.\n   - **Row 1:** We can place a queen at (1, 2) since it doesn't conflict with the queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 2:** We can place a queen at (2, 4) since it doesn't conflict with queens at (0, 0) and (1, 2).\n   - **Row 3:** We can place a queen at (3, 6) since it doesn't conflict with queens at (0, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 4).\n   - **Row 4:** We can place a queen at (4, 1) since it doesn't conflict with queens at (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 6).\n   - **Row 5:** We can place a queen at (5, 3) since it doesn't conflict with queens at (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), and (4, 1).\n   - **Row 6:** We can place a queen at (6, 5) since it doesn't conflict with queens at (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), and (5, 3).\n   - **Row 7:** We can place a queen at (7, 7) since it doesn't conflict with queens at (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 3), and (6, 5).\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Each row has exactly one queen.\n   - Each column has exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens are on the same diagonal.\n   - No queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 1, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
