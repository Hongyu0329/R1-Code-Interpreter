A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have some queens placed, and we need to ensure that the new placements do not conflict with the existing ones. Let's analyze the given grid and proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Existing Queens:**\n   - Row 0: Queen at column 1\n   - Row 3: Queen at column 7\n   - Row 5: Queen at column 7\n\n2. **Mark Forbidden Positions:**\n   - Positions marked with 'X' are not allowed for placing queens. However, in the given grid, there are no 'X' marks, so we don't have any additional restrictions.\n\n3. **Determine Safe Positions:**\n   - We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (1, 2, 4, 6, 7) such that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n4. **Check Columns and Diagonals:**\n   - Columns occupied by existing queens: 1, 7\n   - Diagonals occupied by existing queens:\n     - From (0,1): (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7)\n     - From (3,7): (2,6), (1,5), (0,4), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (7,3)\n     - From (5,7): (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3), (0,2), (6,6), (7,5)\n\n5. **Place Queens in Remaining Rows:**\n   - **Row 1:** Cannot use columns 1, 3, 5, 7. Place queen at column 0.\n   - **Row 2:** Cannot use columns 1, 3, 4, 6, 7. Place queen at column 5.\n   - **Row 4:** Cannot use columns 1, 5, 6, 7. Place queen at column 3.\n   - **Row 6:** Cannot use columns 1, 4, 6, 7. Place queen at column 2.\n   - **Row 7:** Cannot use columns 1, 3, 5, 7. Place queen at column 6.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The placements should satisfy all conditions.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n- Row 0, Column 1\n- Row 1, Column 0\n- Row 2, Column 5\n- Row 3, Column 7\n- Row 4, Column 3\n- Row 5, Column 7\n- Row 6, Column 2\n- Row 7, Column 6\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 2 5, 3 7, 4 3, 5 7, 6 2, 7 6>>>"
