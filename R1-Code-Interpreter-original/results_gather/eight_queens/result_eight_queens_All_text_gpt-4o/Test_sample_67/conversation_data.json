A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the restriction that no queen can be placed in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - There is one queen already placed at position (7, 1).\n   - There is a restriction (X) at position (5, 3).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to place a total of 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen at position (5, 3).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by placing queens row by row, ensuring that each queen is placed in a valid position.\n   - Use backtracking to explore possible placements and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Placement:**\n   - **Row 0:** Place a queen at (0, 0).\n   - **Row 1:** Place a queen at (1, 2).\n   - **Row 2:** Place a queen at (2, 4).\n   - **Row 3:** Place a queen at (3, 6).\n   - **Row 4:** Place a queen at (4, 3).\n   - **Row 5:** Place a queen at (5, 7).\n   - **Row 6:** Place a queen at (6, 5).\n   - **Row 7:** A queen is already placed at (7, 1).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Check that no queen is placed at the restricted position (5, 3).\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully place all eight queens on the board without any conflicts.\n\nThe final positions of the queens are:\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 6, 4 3, 5 7, 6 5, 7 1>>>"
