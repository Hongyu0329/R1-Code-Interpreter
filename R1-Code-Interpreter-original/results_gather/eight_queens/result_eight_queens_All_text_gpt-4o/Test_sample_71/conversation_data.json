A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The grid is 8x8.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - Some cells are marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row.\n   - No two queens can be in the same column.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal (both major and minor diagonals).\n   - Cells marked with 'X' cannot have queens.\n\n3. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is initially empty except for the 'X' marks.\n   - 'X' marks are at positions (2,0), (3,7), and (7,7).\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We will place one queen per row, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - We will avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Placement**:\n   - **Row 0**: Place a queen at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1,2).\n   - **Row 2**: Avoid (2,0) due to 'X'. Place a queen at (2,4).\n   - **Row 3**: Avoid (3,7) due to 'X'. Place a queen at (3,1).\n   - **Row 4**: Place a queen at (4,6).\n   - **Row 5**: Place a queen at (5,3).\n   - **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6,5).\n   - **Row 7**: Avoid (7,7) due to 'X'. Place a queen at (7,7).\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Ensure no queen is placed on an 'X'.\n\nAfter placing the queens according to the above steps, the positions of the queens are:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 2, 2 4, 3 1, 4 6, 5 3, 6 5, 7 7>>>"
