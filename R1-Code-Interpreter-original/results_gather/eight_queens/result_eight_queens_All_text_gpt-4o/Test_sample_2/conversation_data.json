    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the 8x8 grid, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect any cells marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Cells marked with 'X' are off-limits for placing queens.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Start with an empty board since no queens are placed yet.\n   - Mark any 'X' positions if provided (none are given in this case).\n\n3. **Place Queens**:\n   - We need to place one queen in each row.\n   - For each row, find a column where a queen can be placed without being attacked by another queen.\n   - Ensure that the chosen column is not in the same diagonal as any previously placed queen.\n\n4. **Check Diagonals**:\n   - For each queen placed, ensure that no other queen can be placed on the same diagonal. Diagonals can be checked using the difference and sum of row and column indices.\n\n5. **Iterate and Backtrack**:\n   - If a row cannot accommodate a queen without conflict, backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - Since the board is initially empty and no 'X' positions are given, we can use a standard solution for the 8-queens problem.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can place the queens as follows:\n\n- Row 0: Place a queen at column 0.\n- Row 1: Place a queen at column 4.\n- Row 2: Place a queen at column 7.\n- Row 3: Place a queen at column 5.\n- Row 4: Place a queen at column 2.\n- Row 5: Place a queen at column 6.\n- Row 6: Place a queen at column 1.\n- Row 7: Place a queen at column 3.\n\nThis placement ensures that no two queens threaten each other.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
