  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means queens are placed at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as the positions marked with 'X' where queens cannot be placed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed and some restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the positions of the existing queens**: We need to identify which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by the existing queens.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: We need to find positions for the remaining queens such that they do not conflict with the existing queens or the restricted positions.\n\n4. **Ensure all constraints are satisfied**: We need to ensure that the final configuration has exactly eight queens, with no two queens attacking each other, and no queens placed on restricted positions.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board and then proceed to find a solution.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n\n- The board is represented as follows:\n  ```\n  00000000\n  00000000\n  00000010\n  00000000\n  00000000\n  00000000\n  000X0000\n  100000X0\n  ```\n\n- From the board, we can see:\n  - A queen is placed at (2, 6).\n  - A queen is placed at (7, 0).\n  - Restricted positions are at (6, 3) and (7, 6).\n\n### Strategy to Place Remaining Queens\n\n1. **Rows and Columns**: We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6) and ensure no two queens are in the same column.\n\n2. **Diagonals**: We need to ensure that no two queens share the same diagonal.\n\n3. **Avoid Restricted Positions**: Ensure no queen is placed on the restricted positions.\n\nLet's implement a solution using a backtracking approach to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0]\n    ]\n\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return positions\n\nprint(find_queen_positions())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.
