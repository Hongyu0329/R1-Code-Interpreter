  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as not placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed. We need to identify these positions and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens.\n   - We will iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a valid column.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will write a Python script to implement the backtracking algorithm and find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(queen_positions) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
