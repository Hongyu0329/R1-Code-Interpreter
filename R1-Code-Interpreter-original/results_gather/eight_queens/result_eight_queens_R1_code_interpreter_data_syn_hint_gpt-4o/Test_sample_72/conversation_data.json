  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The constraints are that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal, and we cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed. We need to identify the positions of these queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row and column must have exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen on a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we will try placing a queen in each column that is not already occupied by another queen or marked with 'X'.\n   - We will check if placing a queen in a particular cell is valid by ensuring it does not share a column or diagonal with any other queen.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row. If not, we backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            result.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    n = 8\n    result = []\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable value, e.g., -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    # Place the initial queen\n    result.append((0, 1))\n\n    # Solve the rest of the board\n    solve_n_queens(board, 1, n, result)\n\n    # Format the result\n    formatted_result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result)\n    print(f\"<<<{formatted_result}>>>\")\n\nfind_queen_positions()\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the solution was found without any errors. The positions of the queens are given as:\n\n- Row 0, Column 1\n- Row 1, Column 3\n- Row 2, Column 5\n- Row 3, Column 7\n- Row 4, Column 2\n- Row 5, Column 0\n- Row 6, Column 6\n- Row 7, Column 4\n\nThese positions ensure that no two queens threaten each other, and no queen is placed on a cell marked with 'X'.
