  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n00000000\n0X0000X0\n00000X00\n00000000\n00000000\n0000000X\n00000000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means queens are placed at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - Some positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n   - We need to place 8 queens such that no two queens can attack each other.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty except for the 'X' positions.\n   - We need to place queens in such a way that they do not conflict with each other.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we try placing a queen in each column that is not marked with 'X' and is not under attack by any previously placed queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will implement a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration of queens.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[row][i] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][i] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\n    # Collect the positions of the queens\n    queen_positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                queen_positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return queen_positions\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(solve_n_queens())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and return the positions of the queens if a solution is found.",
