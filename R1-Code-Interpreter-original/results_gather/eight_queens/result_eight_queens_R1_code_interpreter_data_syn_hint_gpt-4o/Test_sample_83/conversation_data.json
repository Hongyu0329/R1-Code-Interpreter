  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. We already have two queens placed at positions (0, 4) and (4, 7). We need to place six more queens on the board.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. No two queens can be in the same row.\n2. No two queens can be in the same column.\n3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board and then use a backtracking approach to place the remaining queens.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n- Queens are placed at (0, 4) and (4, 7).\n- Rows 0 and 4 are occupied.\n- Columns 4 and 7 are occupied.\n- Diagonals affected by the queens need to be considered.\n\n### Backtracking Approach\n1. Start from the first row and try to place a queen in each column.\n2. Move to the next row and repeat the process, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.\n3. If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row.\n4. If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try the next column.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return positions\n\nprint(find_queen_positions())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking algorithm and return the positions of all queens.

    "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.
