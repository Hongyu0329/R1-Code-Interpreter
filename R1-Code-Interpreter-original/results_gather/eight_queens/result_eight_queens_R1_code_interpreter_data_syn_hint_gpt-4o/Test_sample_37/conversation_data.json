A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as avoiding the cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We need to determine which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or blocked by 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the available positions**: For each row, find the columns where a queen can be placed without being attacked by another queen or being in a blocked position.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: Using a backtracking approach, attempt to place the remaining queens in the available positions while ensuring no two queens can attack each other.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the board and then use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, queens_positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, queens_positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    queens_positions = [(3, 6)]\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, queens_positions)\n\n    return queens_positions\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach. The `is_safe` function checks if a queen can be placed at a given position without being attacked. The `solve_n_queens` function attempts to place queens row by row. The `find_queen_positions` function initializes the board and calls the solver. The result will be printed as a list of queen positions.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the solution is incorrect because it includes more than eight positions, and some positions are invalid due to the constraints of the board.

    "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n0X000000\n0000X000\n00000010\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00X00000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).
