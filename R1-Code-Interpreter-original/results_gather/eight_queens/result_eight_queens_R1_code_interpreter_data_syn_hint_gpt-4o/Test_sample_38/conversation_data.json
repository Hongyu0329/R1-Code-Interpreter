    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The board is partially filled, and we have some constraints due to the 'X' marking.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Current Board State:**\n   - Row 0: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Row 1: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Row 2: X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Row 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Row 5: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Row 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We cannot place a queen in any column that already has a queen.\n   - We cannot place a queen in any row that already has a queen.\n   - We cannot place a queen in any diagonal that already has a queen.\n   - We cannot place a queen in any cell marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Current Queen Positions:**\n   - (0, 0)\n   - (1, 0)\n   - (5, 1)\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to place queens in the remaining rows (2, 3, 4, 6, 7) while respecting the constraints.\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to try placing queens in each row and backtrack if a conflict arises.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Solve the board\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0)\n\n# Collect the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = []\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            queen_positions.append((i, j))\n\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, respecting all constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",

    "The previous attempts did not correctly solve the problem due to incorrect handling of constraints and initial placements.

Place in column 2.\n- **Row 3:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 due to existing queens and diagonals. Place in column 4.\n- **Row 4:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Place in column 6.\n- **Row 6:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Place in column 5.\n- **Row 7:** Avoid columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Place in column 7.\n\n### Final Queen Positions\n\n- (0, 0)\n- (1, 0)\n- (2, 2)\n- (3, 4)\n- (4, 6)\n- (5, 1)\n- (6, 5)\n- (7, 7)\n\nThis placement respects all constraints and ensures no two queens can attack each other.\n\n<<<'0 0, 1 0, 2 2, 3 4, 4 6, 5 1, 6 5, 7 7'>>>"
