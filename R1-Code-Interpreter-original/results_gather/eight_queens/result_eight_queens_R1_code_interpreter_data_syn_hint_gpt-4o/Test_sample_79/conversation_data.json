    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is an 8x8 grid, and we already have one queen placed at position (0, 7). Additionally, we have a restricted position at (4, 1) marked with 'X', where no queen can be placed.\n\nThe constraints for placing the queens are:\n1. No two queens can be in the same row.\n2. No two queens can be in the same column.\n3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the queens.
