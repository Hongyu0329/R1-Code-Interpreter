  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n00000100\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n10000000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the board, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. We also need to respect any restrictions given by the 'X' marks, although none are present in the current board.\n\nLet's analyze the given board:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nFrom the board, we can see that there are already two queens placed at positions (1, 5) and (7, 0).
