A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We cannot place a queen in a cell marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty except for one cell marked with 'X' at position (3, 6).\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we will attempt to place a queen in each column, checking if the position is valid (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not marked with 'X').\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will implement this logic in Python to find a valid configuration of queens.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable position\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\npositions = []\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, positions)\n\n# Format the output\noutput = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in positions)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board using a backtracking approach, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other and avoiding the 'X' position. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the code successfully found a solution for placing the queens on the board. However, the task requires ensuring that the solution respects the constraints, including avoiding the 'X' position and ensuring no two queens can attack each other.\n\nLet's verify the solution:\n\n1. **Check the 'X' Constraint**: The position (3, 6) is marked with 'X', and the solution does not place a queen there, which is correct.\n\n2. **Check for Attacks**: We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The solution provided by the code should satisfy this condition.\n\n3. **Output Format**: The output is formatted as requested, with each queen's position given as row and column indices.\n\nGiven that the code execution result meets the problem's requirements, we can conclude that the solution is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
