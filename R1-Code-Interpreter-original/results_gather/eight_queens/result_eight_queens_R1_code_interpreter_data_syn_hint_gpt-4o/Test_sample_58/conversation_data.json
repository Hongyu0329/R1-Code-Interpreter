A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Some positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n   - We need to place 8 queens in total.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty except for the 'X' positions.\n   - We need to place queens such that they do not attack each other.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we try placing a queen in each column that is not marked with 'X' and is not attacked by any previously placed queens.\n   - If we successfully place a queen, we move to the next row.\n   - If we cannot place a queen in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check for Attacks**:\n   - A queen can attack another if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - We need to ensure that no two queens are placed in such a way that they can attack each other.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[row][i] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][i] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return result\n\nprint(solve_n_queens())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and ensuring no two queens can attack each other. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a solution was found, but we need to verify if it adheres to the constraints of the problem, particularly the positions marked with 'X'. Let's analyze the output:\n\n- The positions marked with 'X' are (1,3), (2,7), and (5,5).\n- The solution provided places queens at positions: (0,0), (1,6), (2,3), (3,5), (4,7), (5,1), (6,4), and (7,2).\n\nUpon reviewing the solution, it seems that the queens are placed correctly without violating the 'X' constraints. However, let's ensure that the solution is valid by checking if any queens are attacking each other or placed on 'X' positions.\n\nTo verify the solution, let's perform a textual reasoning check:\n\n1. **Check for 'X' Constraint**:\n   - None of the queens are placed on the 'X' positions: (1,3), (2,7), and (5,5).\n\n2. **Check for Attacks**:\n   - No two queens are in the same row or column.\n   - No two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\nGiven these checks, the solution seems valid. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'0 0, 1 6, 2 3, 3 5, 4 7, 5 1, 6 4, 7 2'>>>"
