A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 grid with some queens already placed. We need to identify the positions of these queens and the restricted positions marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Queens cannot be placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens.\n   - We will iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a valid column.\n   - We will check if placing a queen in a particular cell is valid by ensuring it does not conflict with existing queens and is not in a restricted cell.\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check if there's a queen in the same column\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper left diagonal\n    i, j = row, col\n    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n        i -= 1\n        j -= 1\n\n    # Check upper right diagonal\n    i, j = row, col\n    while i >= 0 and j < n:\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n        i -= 1\n        j += 1\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row == n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_valid(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(1, 0), (7, 1)]\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions)\n    return positions\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.

    "The code execution result indicates that the solution is incorrect because it includes more than eight positions, and some positions are repeated.
