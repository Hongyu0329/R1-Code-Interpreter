  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We need to determine which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens or blocked by 'X'.\n\n2. **Determine the available positions**: For each row, identify the columns where a queen can be placed without being attacked by another queen or blocked by 'X'.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: Using a backtracking approach, attempt to place the remaining queens on the board, ensuring that each placement is valid.\n\n4. **Output the final positions**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions in the required format.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board and then proceed with the placement of the remaining queens.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n\n- Row 0: Blocked at column 7\n- Row 1: Queen at column 3\n- Row 5: Blocked at columns 0 and 2\n- Row 6: Blocked at column 3\n\n### Initial Placement\n\n- We have one queen placed at (1, 3).\n- We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n### Strategy\n\n- Use a backtracking algorithm to place the remaining queens.\n- Ensure no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n- Avoid positions marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    n = len(board)\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    ['X', 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to -1 for easier processing\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Find positions\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and output their positions. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the solution is incorrect because it places more than one queen in the same row, which violates the rules of the problem. Additionally, the positions do not respect the constraints of the board, such as avoiding the 'X' marked cells.\n\nLet's switch to a more structured approach to solve this problem. We need to ensure that:\n\n1. Each row has exactly one queen.\n2. No two queens are in the same column.\n3. No two queens are on the same diagonal.\n4. Avoid placing queens on cells marked with 'X'.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a backtracking algorithm that systematically tries to place queens in each row while checking for conflicts.

    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using code have not been successful. The code did not correctly place the queens according to the rules, and it also failed to respect the constraints of the board.
