    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens. We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial placement**: We need to determine the current state of the board and identify which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied or restricted.\n\n3. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens on the board. This involves:\n   - Placing a queen in a valid position on the current row.\n   - Recursively attempting to place queens on subsequent rows.\n   - Backtracking if a conflict arises, i.e., if a queen cannot be placed on a subsequent row without being attacked.\n\n4. **Output the solution**: Once a valid configuration is found, output the positions of the queens.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, row, n, result):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[row][i] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            result.append((row, i))\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1, n, result):\n                return True\n            board[row][i] = 0\n            result.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    result = []\n    if solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n, result):\n        return result\n    else:\n        return \"No solution exists\"\n\nsolution = solve_n_queens()\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and ensuring no two queens can attack each other.
