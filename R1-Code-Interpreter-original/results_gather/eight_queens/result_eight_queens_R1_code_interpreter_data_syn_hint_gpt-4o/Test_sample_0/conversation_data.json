A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 grid.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - Queens cannot be placed in cells marked with 'X'.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty except for the 'X' marks.\n   - We need to find a valid configuration for placing the queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column, checking if it's a valid position.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**:\n   - A position is valid if there is no other queen in the same column, and no queens on the diagonals.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find a valid configuration for placing the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col):\n    # Check column\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return positions\n    \n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_valid(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n            result = solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions)\n            if result:\n                return result\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n    \n    return None\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Convert 'X' to a non-placeable position\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board[i])):\n        if board[i][j] == 'X':\n            board[i][j] = -1\n\n# Solve the problem\npositions = solve_n_queens(board, 0, [])\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and avoiding the 'X' positions.
