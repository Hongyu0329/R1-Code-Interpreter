  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens. Please help me complete the placement of the remaining queens on the partially filled board.\n\n00000000\n00000000\n00010000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of queen positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means queens are placed at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. We also need to respect any restrictions given by cells marked with 'X', but in this case, there are no such restrictions.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board:\n\n```\n00000000\n00000000\n00010000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n```\n\nThe board has a queen placed at position (2, 3). We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Row and Column Constraints**: \n   - Row 2 already has a queen, so we cannot place another queen in this row.\n   - Column 3 already has a queen, so we cannot place another queen in this column.\n\n2. **Diagonal Constraints**:\n   - The queen at (2, 3) attacks all positions on its diagonals. We need to avoid these diagonals.\n\n3. **Placement Strategy**:\n   - We will place one queen per row, starting from row 0, and ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Placement:\n\n- **Row 0**: Place a queen at (0, 5) (not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3)).\n- **Row 1**: Place a queen at (1, 7) (not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3) or (0, 5)).\n- **Row 3**: Place a queen at (3, 1) (not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3), (0, 5), or (1, 7)).\n- **Row 4**: Place a queen at (4, 6) (not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3), (0, 5), (1, 7), or (3, 1)).\n- **Row 5**: Place a queen at (5, 0) (not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3), (0, 5), (1, 7), (3, 1), or (4, 6)).\n- **Row 6**: Place a queen at (6, 4) (not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3), (0, 5), (1, 7), (3, 1), (4, 6), or (5, 0)).\n- **Row 7**: Place a queen at (7, 2) (not in the same column or diagonal as (2, 3), (0, 5), (1, 7), (3, 1), (4, 6), (5, 0), or (6, 4)).\n\nNow, let's list the positions of all the queens:\n\n- (0, 5)\n- (1, 7)\n- (2, 3) (already placed)\n- (3, 1)\n- (4, 6)\n- (5, 0)\n- (6, 4)\n- (7, 2)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 5, 1 7, 2 3, 3 1, 4 6, 5 0, 6 4, 7 2>>>"
