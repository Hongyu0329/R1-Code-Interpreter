A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current board state**: We have a partially filled board with one queen already placed at position (6, 0) and a restricted cell at (6, 5) and (7, 2).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We cannot place more than one queen in any row or column.\n   - We cannot place queens on the same diagonal.\n   - We cannot place queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we will attempt to place a queen in each column, checking if the position is valid (i.e., not attacked by any other queen and not restricted).\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0)\n\n# Collect the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = []\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            queen_positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and output their positions.

    "The code execution result indicates that there are errors in the solution. The output contains more than eight queens, and some queens are placed in the same row, which violates the rules of the problem. Additionally, the solution does not respect the constraints of the restricted cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's switch to a more structured approach to solve this problem using backtracking, ensuring that we respect all constraints and place exactly eight queens on the board.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n\n1. **Initialize the Board**: Start with the given board configuration, marking the positions of existing queens and restricted cells.\n\n2. **Backtracking Algorithm**:\n   - Attempt to place a queen in each row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other.\n   - For each row, iterate over each column and check if placing a queen is valid.\n   - A position is valid if:\n     - There is no other queen in the same column.\n     - There is no other queen on the same diagonal.\n     - The cell is not marked with 'X'.\n   - If a valid position is found, place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n3. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed, output their positions.\n\nLet's implement this revised approach using Python code.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens_placed):\n    if queens_placed == 8:\n        return True\n\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return False\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_placed + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_placed)\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, 2)  # Start with 2 queens already placed\n\n# Collect the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = []\nfor i in range(len(board)):\n    for j in range(len(board)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            queen_positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and output their positions.
