  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. We also need to respect the positions marked with 'X', which are not allowed for placing queens.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current positions of the queens**: We need to find out where the queens are already placed on the board.\n\n2. **Determine the available positions**: We need to identify which positions are available for placing the remaining queens, considering the constraints of rows, columns, diagonals, and 'X' positions.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: We need to place the remaining queens in such a way that they do not attack each other.\n\nLet's start by identifying the current positions of the queens and then proceed to find the solution.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\nThe given board is:\n```\n00000000\n10000000\n00000000\n00000100\n00000000\n00000000\n01000000\n00000000\n```\n\nFrom this, we can see that queens are currently placed at:\n- Row 1, Column 0\n- Row 3, Column 5\n- Row 6, Column 2\n\n### Steps to Solve\n1. **Mark the occupied rows, columns, and diagonals**: We need to keep track of which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n2. **Backtracking approach**: We can use a backtracking approach to try placing queens in the remaining rows, ensuring that no two queens attack each other.\n\nLet's implement this in code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n, positions):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if is_safe(board, row, i, n):\n            board[row][i] = 1\n            positions.append((row, i))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n, positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][i] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    positions = [(1, 0), (3, 5), (6, 2)]\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0, n, positions)\n    return positions\n\npositions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, ensuring that no two queens attack each other.
