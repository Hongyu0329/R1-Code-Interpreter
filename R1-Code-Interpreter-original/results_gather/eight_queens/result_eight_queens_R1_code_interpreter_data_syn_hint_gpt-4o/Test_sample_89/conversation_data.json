A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot be used.\n   - We need to place 8 queens in total.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty except for the 'X' positions.\n   - We need to place queens such that they do not attack each other.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, we try placing a queen in each column that is not under attack and not marked with 'X'.\n   - If a valid position is found, we move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**:\n   - A position is valid if there is no other queen in the same column, and no queens on the diagonals.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col):\n    # Check column\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, queens_positions):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n    \n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_valid(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            queens_positions.append((row, col))\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, queens_positions):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            queens_positions.pop()\n    \n    return False\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X'],\n    [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nqueens_positions = []\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0, queens_positions)\n\n# Format the output\noutput = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in queens_positions)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and ensuring no two queens can attack each other. The output will be the positions of the queens in the required format.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a valid configuration of queens was found, but we need to ensure that the solution respects the constraints of the board, particularly the positions marked with 'X'. Let's verify the solution and ensure that no queens are placed in positions marked with 'X'.\n\nThe board setup is as follows:\n\n```\n00000000\n00000000\n0X000000\n0000000X\n00000000\n0000000X\n0X000000\n00000000\n```\n\nThe positions marked with 'X' are:\n- (2, 1)\n- (3, 7)\n- (5, 7)\n- (6, 1)\n\nThe solution provided by the code was:\n- (0, 0), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 7), (5, 1), (6, 4), (7, 2)\n\nLet's check if any of these positions conflict with the 'X' positions:\n- (5, 1) is a conflict because it is marked with 'X'.\n\nSince there is a conflict, we need to adjust the solution.
