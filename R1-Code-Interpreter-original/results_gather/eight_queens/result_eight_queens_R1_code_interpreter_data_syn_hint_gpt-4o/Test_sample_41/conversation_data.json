  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current state of the board**: We need to determine which rows, columns, and diagonals are already occupied by queens.\n\n2. **Determine the constraints**: We need to ensure that no queens are placed in positions marked with 'X'.\n\n3. **Place the remaining queens**: We need to find positions for the remaining queens such that they do not conflict with the existing queens or each other.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board:\n\n```\nXX000000\n0000010X\n00000000\n00000000\n00000001\n00000000\n00000000\n00X00000\n```\n\nFrom the board, we can see:\n- Queens are already placed at (1, 5) and (4, 7).\n- Positions (0, 0), (0, 1), and (7, 2) are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to find the positions for the remaining queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this row on left side\n    for i in range(col):\n        if board[row][i] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check lower diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n):\n    if col >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if board[i][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, i, col, n):\n            board[i][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[i][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_n_queens():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        ['X', 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 'X'],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, n):\n        return \"Solution does not exist\"\n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                result.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return result\n\nprint(solve_n_queens())\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.
