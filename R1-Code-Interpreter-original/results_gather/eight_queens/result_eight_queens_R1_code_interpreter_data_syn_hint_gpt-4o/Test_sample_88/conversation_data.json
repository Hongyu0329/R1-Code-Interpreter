    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The board is an 8x8 grid, and we already have two queens placed at positions (3,2) and (6,7). We need to place six more queens.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. No two queens can be in the same row.\n2. No two queens can be in the same column.\n3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current board:\n\n- Row 3 has a queen at column 2.\n- Row 6 has a queen at column 7.\n\nWe need to place queens in the remaining rows: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.\n\nTo ensure no two queens are in the same column or diagonal, we can use a backtracking approach to try placing queens in each row and check for conflicts.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i] == col or \\\n           board[i] - i == col - row or \\\n           board[i] + i == col + row:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row == len(board):\n        return True\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row] = col\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row] = -1\n    return False\n\n# Initialize the board with -1 (no queen placed)\nboard = [-1] * 8\n\n# Place the queens that are already on the board\nboard[3] = 2\nboard[6] = 7\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolve_n_queens(board, 0)\n\n# Collect the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = [(i, board[i]) for i in range(8)]\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board and print the positions of all eight queens.
