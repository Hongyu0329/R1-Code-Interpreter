  "question": "Given an 8*8 grid, cells marked with 1 have a queen placed, and cells marked with 0 are empty. A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must avoid placing queens in cells marked with 'X'.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**:\n   - Each row and column must have exactly one queen.\n   - No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n   - Avoid cells marked with 'X'.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - We can use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens.\n   - Start from the first row and try to place a queen in each column.\n   - Move to the next row and repeat the process, ensuring no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - If a placement leads to a conflict, backtrack and try the next possible position.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - We will represent the board as a list of lists.\n   - Use a recursive function to attempt to place queens row by row.\n   - Check for conflicts before placing a queen.\n   - If a solution is found, return the positions of the queens.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, positions):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            positions.append((row, col))\n\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, positions):\n                return True\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[row][col] = 0\n            positions.pop()\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    positions = []\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, positions):\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\npositions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and avoiding the 'X' marked cell.
