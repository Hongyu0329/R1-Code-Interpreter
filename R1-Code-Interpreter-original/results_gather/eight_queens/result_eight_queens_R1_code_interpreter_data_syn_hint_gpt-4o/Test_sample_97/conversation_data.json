A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, such as avoiding the 'X' marked positions.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: \n   - We have an 8x8 board.\n   - We need to place 8 queens.\n   - Queens cannot be placed on 'X' marked positions.\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n2. **Initial Board Setup**:\n   - The board is initially empty with some 'X' marked positions.\n   - We need to find a valid configuration for placing the queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**:\n   - We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens row by row.\n   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column that is not marked with 'X' and is not under attack by any previously placed queens.\n   - If a valid position is found, move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**:\n   - For each position, check if placing a queen there would result in any conflicts with already placed queens.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 0 and is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 'X', 'X', 0]\n    ]\n\n    # Convert 'X' to a non-placeable marker\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 'X':\n                board[i][j] = -1\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return []\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and avoiding the 'X' marked positions. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the solution found a valid configuration for placing the queens on the board. However, we need to ensure that the solution respects the constraints, especially avoiding the 'X' marked positions.\n\nLet's verify the solution:\n\n1. **Check for 'X' Positions**: Ensure no queen is placed on a position marked with 'X'.\n2. **Check for Validity**: Ensure no two queens attack each other.\n\nThe positions found are:\n- (0, 0)\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 7)\n- (3, 5)\n- (4, 2)\n- (5, 6)\n- (6, 1)\n- (7, 3)\n\nLet's verify these positions against the constraints:\n\n- The 'X' positions are at (3, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), and (7, 6).\n- None of the queens are placed on these 'X' positions.\n\nAdditionally, the queens are placed such that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal, which satisfies the problem's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the solution is valid. Let's format the final answer.\n\n<<<'0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3'>>>"
