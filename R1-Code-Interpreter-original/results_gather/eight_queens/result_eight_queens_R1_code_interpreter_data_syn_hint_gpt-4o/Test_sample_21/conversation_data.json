A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. The board is partially filled, and we have constraints where some positions are marked with 'X' and cannot be used.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an 8x8 board with one queen already placed at position (0, 3). We need to place 7 more queens.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Positions marked with 'X' cannot be used.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens.\n   - We will iterate over each row and try to place a queen in a valid column.\n   - We will check if the position is valid by ensuring no other queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n   - If a valid position is found, we place the queen and move to the next row.\n   - If no valid position is found, we backtrack and try a different position for the previous queen.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions(board):\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board)):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\n# Initial board setup\nboard = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Find and print the positions of the queens\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions(board)\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board while respecting the constraints.

    "The code execution result indicates that the solution was not found, as it only returned the initial position of the queen. This suggests that the backtracking algorithm did not correctly place the remaining queens.
