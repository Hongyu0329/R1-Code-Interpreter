A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, we must respect the constraints of the board, where certain positions are marked with 'X' and cannot have a queen placed on them.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Constraints**: We have an 8x8 board with some positions marked as 'X'. These positions cannot have queens placed on them.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: We need to place 8 queens on the board. Since the board is initially empty (except for the 'X' constraints), we have the freedom to choose positions for all 8 queens.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens one by one in each row, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other. If we reach a row where no valid position is available, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each position, we need to check if placing a queen there would result in a conflict with any previously placed queens. This involves checking the column, and both diagonals.\n\n5. **Output the Solution**: Once all queens are placed successfully, we output their positions.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, n)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row, n):\n    if row >= n:\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(n):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 'X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    if solve_n_queens(board, 0, n):\n        positions = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if board[i][j] == 1:\n                    positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n        return positions\n    else:\n        return \"No solution found\"\n\nqueen_positions = find_queen_positions()\nprint(queen_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the queens on the board while respecting the constraints and ensuring no two queens can attack each other.
