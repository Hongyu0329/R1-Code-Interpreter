A total of eight queens need to be placed such that no two queens can attack each other, meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Additionally, positions marked with X are not allowed for placing queens.

    "To solve the problem of placing the remaining queens on the board, we need to ensure that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. \n\nGiven that the board is initially empty, we can use a backtracking algorithm to place the queens. The backtracking algorithm will try to place a queen in each row, ensuring that it does not conflict with any previously placed queens. If a conflict arises, the algorithm will backtrack and try a different position.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Start with the first row and try to place a queen in each column.\n2. For each placement, check if it is safe by ensuring no other queens are in the same column or diagonal.\n3. If a safe position is found, move to the next row and repeat the process.\n4. If no safe position is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try the next possible position.\n5. Continue this process until all queens are placed on the board.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find a valid configuration for the queens.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    n = 8\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0)\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n    return positions\n\nprint(find_queen_positions())\n```\n\nThis code will output a list of positions where the queens are placed on the board. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the algorithm successfully found a solution to the 8-queens problem. The positions of the queens are given as a list of strings, where each string represents the row and column of a queen on the board.\n\nThe solution provided by the code is:\n- Row 0, Column 0\n- Row 1, Column 4\n- Row 2, Column 7\n- Row 3, Column 5\n- Row 4, Column 2\n- Row 5, Column 6\n- Row 6, Column 1\n- Row 7, Column 3\n\nThis configuration ensures that no two queens threaten each other, as no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<0 0, 1 4, 2 7, 3 5, 4 2, 5 6, 6 1, 7 3>>>"
