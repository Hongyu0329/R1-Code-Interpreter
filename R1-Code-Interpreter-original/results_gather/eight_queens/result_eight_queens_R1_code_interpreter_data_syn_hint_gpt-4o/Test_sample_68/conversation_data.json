    "To solve this problem, we need to place the remaining queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. The board is an 8x8 grid, and we have one queen already placed at position (4, 2). Additionally, we have a restricted position at (5, 5) marked with 'X', where no queen can be placed.\n\nThe constraints for placing the queens are:\n1. No two queens can be in the same row.\n2. No two queens can be in the same column.\n3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to find a valid configuration for the queens. The backtracking algorithm will try to place a queen in each row, ensuring that it does not conflict with any previously placed queens.\n\nLet's implement this using Python code to find a valid solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(board, row, col):\n    # Check this column on upper side\n    for i in range(row):\n        if board[i][col] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on left side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    # Check upper diagonal on right side\n    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):\n        if board[i][j] == 1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef solve_n_queens(board, row):\n    if row >= len(board):\n        return True\n\n    for col in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][col] == 'X':\n            continue\n        if is_safe(board, row, col):\n            board[row][col] = 1\n            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):\n                return True\n            board[row][col] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef find_queen_positions():\n    board = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'X', 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n\n    solve_n_queens(board, 0)\n\n    positions = []\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board)):\n            if board[i][j] == 1:\n                positions.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n\n    return positions\n\nprint(find_queen_positions())\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to place the remaining queens on the board using a backtracking approach, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other. The function `find_queen_positions` will return the list of positions where the queens are placed.",
    "The code execution result indicates an error because the output contains more than eight positions, and it includes duplicate row indices, which violates the rule that no two queens can be in the same row.
