  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Dismantling two machine B units produces one part X each cycle.\nMethod 3: Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: Each round, one part X and one part Y merge to form one part Z.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 3 units of Machine A, 3 units of Machine B, and 3 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the dismantling and combining process step by step, following the given methods in order. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 3, B = 3, C = 3\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n   - Use 1 unit of A: A = 2, X = 2, Y = 1\n\n3. **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B to produce one part X.\n   - Use 2 units of B: B = 1, X = 3\n\n4. **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one unit of part Y.\n   - Use 2 units of C: C = 1, Y = 2\n\n5. **Method 4:** Combine one unit of machine B and one unit of machine C into one unit of machine A.\n   - Use 1 unit of B and 1 unit of C: A = 3, B = 0, C = 0\n\n6. **Method 5:** Merge one part X and one part Y to form one part Z.\n   - Use 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 2, Y = 1, Z = 1\n\n7. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Use 1 unit of A: A = 2, X = 4, Y = 2\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot execute (B < 2)\n   - **Method 3:** Cannot execute (C < 2)\n   - **Method 4:** Cannot execute (B < 1 or C < 1)\n   - **Method 5:** Use 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 3, Y = 1, Z = 2\n\n8. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Use 1 unit of A: A = 1, X = 5, Y = 2\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot execute (B < 2)\n   - **Method 3:** Cannot execute (C < 2)\n   - **Method 4:** Cannot execute (B < 1 or C < 1)\n   - **Method 5:** Use 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 4, Y = 1, Z = 3\n\n9. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Use 1 unit of A: A = 0, X = 6, Y = 2\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot execute (B < 2)\n   - **Method 3:** Cannot execute (C < 2)\n   - **Method 4:** Cannot execute (B < 1 or C < 1)\n   - **Method 5:** Use 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 5, Y = 1, Z = 4\n\n10. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n    - **Method 1:** Cannot execute (A < 1)\n    - **Method 2:** Cannot execute (B < 2)\n    - **Method 3:** Cannot execute (C < 2)\n    - **Method 4:** Cannot execute (B < 1 or C < 1)\n    - **Method 5:** Use 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 4, Y = 0, Z = 5\n\n11. **Final State:**\n    - Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n    - Parts: X = 4, Y = 0, Z = 5\n\nThe final outcome is: <<<[\"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"4\", \"0\", \"5\"]>>>"
