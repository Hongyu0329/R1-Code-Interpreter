  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: Dismantling a single machine A yields two part X and one part Y each cycle.\nMethod 2: Every round, dismantling two machines B results in one part X.\nMethod 3: Dismantling two machine C units yields one part Y each cycle.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: Combining one part X with one part Y produces one part Z each cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 2 units of Machine A, 2 units of Machine B, and 1 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and combining machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 2, B = 2, C = 1\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1: Dismantle Machine A**\n   - Dismantle 1 unit of A: A = 1, X = 2, Y = 1\n\n3. **Method 2: Dismantle Machine B**\n   - Dismantle 2 units of B: B = 0, X = 3\n\n4. **Method 3: Dismantle Machine C**\n   - Cannot execute because we need 2 units of C, but we only have 1.\n\n5. **Method 4: Combine Machine B and C into Machine A**\n   - Cannot execute because we need 1 unit of B, but we have 0.\n\n6. **Method 5: Combine Parts X and Y into Part Z**\n   - Combine 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 1\n\n7. **Cycle Restart: Method 1**\n   - Dismantle 1 unit of A: A = 0, X = 4, Y = 1\n\n8. **Method 2: Dismantle Machine B**\n   - Cannot execute because we need 2 units of B, but we have 0.\n\n9. **Method 3: Dismantle Machine C**\n   - Cannot execute because we need 2 units of C, but we only have 1.\n\n10. **Method 4: Combine Machine B and C into Machine A**\n    - Cannot execute because we need 1 unit of B, but we have 0.\n\n11. **Method 5: Combine Parts X and Y into Part Z**\n    - Combine 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\n12. **Cycle Restart: Method 1**\n    - Cannot execute because we need 1 unit of A, but we have 0.\n\n13. **Method 2: Dismantle Machine B**\n    - Cannot execute because we need 2 units of B, but we have 0.\n\n14. **Method 3: Dismantle Machine C**\n    - Cannot execute because we need 2 units of C, but we only have 1.\n\n15. **Method 4: Combine Machine B and C into Machine A**\n    - Cannot execute because we need 1 unit of B, but we have 0.\n\n16. **Method 5: Combine Parts X and Y into Part Z**\n    - Cannot execute because we need 1 unit of Y, but we have 0.\n\nAt this point, no further methods can be executed. Therefore, the final state is:\n\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n- Parts: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\nThe answer is: [\"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"3\", \"0\", \"2\"]"
