  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Two units of machine B can be dismantled into one unit of part X per round.\nMethod 3: Dismantling two machine C units yields one part Y each cycle.\nMethod 4: Every round, merging one machine B with one machine C creates one machine A.\nMethod 5: Combining one part X with one part Y produces one part Z each cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 4 units of Machine A, 4 units of Machine B, and 6 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and merging machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 4, B = 4, C = 6\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n   - Execute 4 times (since there are 4 units of A).\n   - After 4 rounds: A = 0, X = 8, Y = 4\n\n3. **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B into one unit of part X.\n   - Execute 2 times (since there are 4 units of B).\n   - After 2 rounds: B = 0, X = 10, Y = 4\n\n4. **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one unit of part Y.\n   - Execute 3 times (since there are 6 units of C).\n   - After 3 rounds: C = 0, X = 10, Y = 7\n\n5. **Method 4:** Merge one machine B with one machine C to create one machine A.\n   - Cannot execute because B = 0 and C = 0.\n\n6. **Method 5:** Combine one part X with one part Y to produce one part Z.\n   - Execute 7 times (since there are 7 units of Y and 10 units of X).\n   - After 7 rounds: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 7\n\n7. **Cycle Restart:**\n   - Method 1: Cannot execute because A = 0.\n   - Method 2: Cannot execute because B = 0.\n   - Method 3: Cannot execute because C = 0.\n   - Method 4: Cannot execute because B = 0 and C = 0.\n   - Method 5: Cannot execute because Y = 0.\n\nSince no more methods can be executed, the final state is:\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n- Parts: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 7\n\nThe final answer is: [\"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"3\", \"0\", \"7\"]"
