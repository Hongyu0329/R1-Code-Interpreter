  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: Each round, one machine A breaks down into two part X and one part Y.\nMethod 2: Dismantling two machine B units produces one part X each cycle.\nMethod 3: Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 4: Combining one machine B and one machine C results in one machine A each cycle.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 5 units of Machine A, 5 units of Machine B, and 6 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and combining machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 5, B = 5, C = 6\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Each round, one machine A breaks down into two parts X and one part Y.\n   - Execute this method 5 times (since there are 5 machines A initially).\n   - After 5 executions: \n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 5, C = 6\n     - Parts: X = 10, Y = 5, Z = 0\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Dismantling two machine B units produces one part X each cycle.\n   - Execute this method 2 times (since there are 5 machines B, but only 4 can be used in pairs).\n   - After 2 executions:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 6\n     - Parts: X = 12, Y = 5, Z = 0\n\n4. **Method 3:**\n   - Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.\n   - Execute this method 3 times (since there are 6 machines C, which can be used in pairs).\n   - After 3 executions:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n     - Parts: X = 12, Y = 8, Z = 0\n\n5. **Method 4:**\n   - Combining one machine B and one machine C results in one machine A each cycle.\n   - Cannot execute this method because there are no machines C left.\n\n6. **Method 5:**\n   - One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n   - Execute this method 8 times (since there are 8 parts Y, and we have enough parts X).\n   - After 8 executions:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n     - Parts: X = 4, Y = 0, Z = 8\n\n7. **Cycle Restart:**\n   - Method 1 cannot be executed because there are no machines A.\n   - Method 2 cannot be executed because there is only 1 machine B.\n   - Method 3 cannot be executed because there are no machines C.\n   - Method 4 cannot be executed because there are no machines C.\n   - Method 5 cannot be executed because there are no parts Y.\n\nSince no further methods can be executed, the process ends here.\n\nFinal state:\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n- Parts: X = 4, Y = 0, Z = 8\n\nThe answer is: [\"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"4\", \"0\", \"8\"]"
