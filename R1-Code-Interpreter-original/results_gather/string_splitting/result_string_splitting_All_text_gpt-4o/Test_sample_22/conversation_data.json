  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Dismantling two machine B units produces one part X each cycle.\nMethod 3: Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 4: Every round, merging one machine B with one machine C creates one machine A.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 2 units of Machine A, 2 units of Machine B, and 1 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and combining machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 2, B = 2, C = 1\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n   - Use 1 unit of A: A = 1, X = 2, Y = 1\n\n3. **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B to produce one part X.\n   - Use 2 units of B: B = 0, X = 3\n\n4. **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one unit of part Y.\n   - Not applicable as C = 1 (need 2 units of C).\n\n5. **Method 4:** Merge one machine B with one machine C to create one machine A.\n   - Not applicable as B = 0 (need 1 unit of B).\n\n6. **Method 5:** Combine one unit of part X and one unit of part Y into one unit of part Z.\n   - Use 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 1\n\n7. **Cycle Restart:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n     - Use 1 unit of A: A = 0, X = 4, Y = 1\n\n   - **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B to produce one part X.\n     - Not applicable as B = 0 (need 2 units of B).\n\n   - **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one unit of part Y.\n     - Not applicable as C = 1 (need 2 units of C).\n\n   - **Method 4:** Merge one machine B with one machine C to create one machine A.\n     - Not applicable as B = 0 (need 1 unit of B).\n\n   - **Method 5:** Combine one unit of part X and one unit of part Y into one unit of part Z.\n     - Use 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\n8. **Cycle Restart:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n     - Not applicable as A = 0 (need 1 unit of A).\n\n   - **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B to produce one part X.\n     - Not applicable as B = 0 (need 2 units of B).\n\n   - **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one unit of part Y.\n     - Not applicable as C = 1 (need 2 units of C).\n\n   - **Method 4:** Merge one machine B with one machine C to create one machine A.\n     - Not applicable as B = 0 (need 1 unit of B).\n\n   - **Method 5:** Combine one unit of part X and one unit of part Y into one unit of part Z.\n     - Not applicable as Y = 0 (need 1 unit of Y).\n\nAt this point, no further methods can be executed. The final state is:\n\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n- Parts: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[\"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"3\", \"0\", \"2\"]"
