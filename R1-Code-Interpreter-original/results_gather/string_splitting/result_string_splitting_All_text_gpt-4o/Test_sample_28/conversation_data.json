  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Every round, dismantling two machines B results in one part X.\nMethod 3: Each round, two machines C break down into one part Y.\nMethod 4: Every round, merging one machine B with one machine C creates one machine A.\nMethod 5: Each round, one part X and one part Y merge to form one part Z.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 3 units of Machine A, 2 units of Machine B, and 1 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and merging machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 3, B = 2, C = 1\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n   - Execute this method 3 times (since there are 3 units of A).\n   - After 3 rounds: A = 0, X = 6, Y = 3\n\n3. **Method 2:** Dismantle two machines B into one part X.\n   - Execute this method 1 time (since there are 2 units of B).\n   - After 1 round: B = 0, X = 7\n\n4. **Method 3:** Dismantle two machines C into one part Y.\n   - Cannot execute this method (since there is only 1 unit of C).\n\n5. **Method 4:** Merge one machine B with one machine C to create one machine A.\n   - Cannot execute this method (since there are no units of B).\n\n6. **Method 5:** Merge one part X and one part Y to form one part Z.\n   - Execute this method 3 times (since there are 3 units of Y and at least 3 units of X).\n   - After 3 rounds: X = 4, Y = 0, Z = 3\n\n7. **Cycle through methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Cannot execute (since there are no units of A).\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot execute (since there are no units of B).\n   - **Method 3:** Cannot execute (since there are not enough units of C).\n   - **Method 4:** Cannot execute (since there are no units of B).\n   - **Method 5:** Cannot execute (since there are no units of Y).\n\n8. **Final State:**\n   - Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n   - Parts: X = 4, Y = 0, Z = 3\n\nThe final outcome is represented as [\"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"4\", \"0\", \"3\"]."
