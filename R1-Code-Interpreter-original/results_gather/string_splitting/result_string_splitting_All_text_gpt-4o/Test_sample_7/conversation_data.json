  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: Each round, one machine A breaks down into two part X and one part Y.\nMethod 2: Every round, dismantling two machines B results in one part X.\nMethod 3: Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 1 units of Machine A, 1 units of Machine B, and 2 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and combining machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 1, B = 1, C = 2\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Dismantle 1 machine A into 2 parts X and 1 part Y.\n   - New state:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 2\n     - Parts: X = 2, Y = 1, Z = 0\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Dismantle 2 machines B into 1 part X. (Not possible as B = 1)\n   - State remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Method 3:**\n   - Dismantle 2 machines C into 1 part Y.\n   - New state:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n     - Parts: X = 2, Y = 2, Z = 0\n\n5. **Method 4:**\n   - Combine 1 machine B and 1 machine C into 1 machine A. (Not possible as C = 0)\n   - State remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Method 5:**\n   - Combine 1 part X and 1 part Y into 1 part Z.\n   - New state:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n     - Parts: X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1\n\n7. **Cycle Repeats:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** (Not possible as A = 0)\n   - **Method 2:** (Not possible as B = 1)\n   - **Method 3:** (Not possible as C = 0)\n   - **Method 4:** (Not possible as C = 0)\n   - **Method 5:**\n     - Combine 1 part X and 1 part Y into 1 part Z.\n     - New state:\n       - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n       - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\n8. **Cycle Repeats Again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** (Not possible as A = 0)\n   - **Method 2:** (Not possible as B = 1)\n   - **Method 3:** (Not possible as C = 0)\n   - **Method 4:** (Not possible as C = 0)\n   - **Method 5:** (Not possible as X = 0 and Y = 0)\n\nAt this point, no further methods can be executed. Therefore, the final state is:\n\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n- Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\nThe answer is: [\"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"2\"]"
