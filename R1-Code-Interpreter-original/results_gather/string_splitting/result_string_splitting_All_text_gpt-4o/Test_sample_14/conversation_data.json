  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: Dismantling a single machine A yields two part X and one part Y each cycle.\nMethod 2: Every round, dismantling two machines B results in one part X.\nMethod 3: Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 3 units of Machine A, 1 units of Machine B, and 2 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and combining machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 3, B = 1, C = 2\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1: Dismantle Machine A**\n   - Dismantle 1 unit of A: A = 2, X = 2, Y = 1\n\n3. **Method 2: Dismantle Machines B**\n   - Not enough B (need 2, have 1), so skip this method.\n\n4. **Method 3: Dismantle Machines C**\n   - Dismantle 2 units of C: C = 0, Y = 2\n\n5. **Method 4: Combine Machines B and C into A**\n   - Not enough C (need 1, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n6. **Method 5: Combine Parts X and Y into Z**\n   - Combine 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1\n\n7. **Cycle through methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1: Dismantle Machine A**\n     - Dismantle 1 unit of A: A = 1, X = 3, Y = 2\n\n   - **Method 2: Dismantle Machines B**\n     - Not enough B (need 2, have 1), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 3: Dismantle Machines C**\n     - Not enough C (need 2, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 4: Combine Machines B and C into A**\n     - Not enough C (need 1, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 5: Combine Parts X and Y into Z**\n     - Combine 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 2, Y = 1, Z = 2\n\n8. **Cycle through methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1: Dismantle Machine A**\n     - Dismantle 1 unit of A: A = 0, X = 4, Y = 2\n\n   - **Method 2: Dismantle Machines B**\n     - Not enough B (need 2, have 1), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 3: Dismantle Machines C**\n     - Not enough C (need 2, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 4: Combine Machines B and C into A**\n     - Not enough C (need 1, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 5: Combine Parts X and Y into Z**\n     - Combine 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 3, Y = 1, Z = 3\n\n9. **Cycle through methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1: Dismantle Machine A**\n     - Not enough A (need 1, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 2: Dismantle Machines B**\n     - Not enough B (need 2, have 1), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 3: Dismantle Machines C**\n     - Not enough C (need 2, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 4: Combine Machines B and C into A**\n     - Not enough C (need 1, have 0), so skip this method.\n\n   - **Method 5: Combine Parts X and Y into Z**\n     - Combine 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 4\n\n10. **Final State:**\n    - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n    - Parts: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 4\n\nThe final answer is: [\"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"2\", \"0\", \"4\"]"
