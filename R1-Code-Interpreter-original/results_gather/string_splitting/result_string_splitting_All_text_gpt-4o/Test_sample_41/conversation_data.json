  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: Dismantling a single machine A yields two part X and one part Y each cycle.\nMethod 2: Dismantling two machine B units produces one part X each cycle.\nMethod 3: Each round, two machines C break down into one part Y.\nMethod 4: Every round, merging one machine B with one machine C creates one machine A.\nMethod 5: Combining one part X with one part Y produces one part Z each cycle.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 3 units of Machine A, 3 units of Machine B, and 2 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and merging machines according to the given methods, cycling through them in order until no method can be executed. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 3, B = 3, C = 2\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:** Dismantle one machine A to get 2 parts X and 1 part Y.\n   - Execute 3 times (since there are 3 machines A).\n   - Machines: A = 0, B = 3, C = 2\n   - Parts: X = 6, Y = 3, Z = 0\n\n3. **Method 2:** Dismantle two machines B to get 1 part X.\n   - Execute 1 time (since there are 3 machines B, but only 1 full cycle can be done).\n   - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 2\n   - Parts: X = 7, Y = 3, Z = 0\n\n4. **Method 3:** Dismantle two machines C to get 1 part Y.\n   - Execute 1 time (since there are 2 machines C).\n   - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n   - Parts: X = 7, Y = 4, Z = 0\n\n5. **Method 4:** Merge one machine B with one machine C to create one machine A.\n   - Cannot execute (since there are no machines C).\n\n6. **Method 5:** Combine one part X with one part Y to produce one part Z.\n   - Execute 4 times (since there are 4 parts Y and 7 parts X).\n   - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n   - Parts: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 4\n\n7. **Cycle through methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Cannot execute (since there are no machines A).\n   - **Method 2:** Cannot execute (since there is only 1 machine B).\n   - **Method 3:** Cannot execute (since there are no machines C).\n   - **Method 4:** Cannot execute (since there are no machines C).\n   - **Method 5:** Cannot execute (since there are no parts Y).\n\nSince no method can be executed anymore, the process stops here.\n\nThe final state is:\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n- Parts: X = 3, Y = 0, Z = 4\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n[\"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"3\", \"0\", \"4\"]"
