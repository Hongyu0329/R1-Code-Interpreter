  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Two units of machine B can be dismantled into one unit of part X per round.\nMethod 3: Dismantling two machine C units yields one part Y each cycle.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 1 units of Machine A, 1 units of Machine B, and 1 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and combining machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 1, B = 1, C = 1\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Dismantle 1 unit of machine A into 2 units of part X and 1 unit of part Y.\n   - New state:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 1\n     - Parts: X = 2, Y = 1, Z = 0\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Dismantle 2 units of machine B into 1 unit of part X.\n   - We have only 1 unit of B, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n4. **Method 3:**\n   - Dismantle 2 units of machine C into 1 unit of part Y.\n   - We have only 1 unit of C, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n5. **Method 4:**\n   - Combine 1 unit of machine B and 1 unit of machine C into 1 unit of machine A.\n   - New state:\n     - Machines: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n     - Parts: X = 2, Y = 1, Z = 0\n\n6. **Method 5:**\n   - Combine 1 unit of part X and 1 unit of part Y into 1 unit of part Z.\n   - New state:\n     - Machines: A = 1, B = 0, C = 0\n     - Parts: X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1\n\n7. **Cycle Restart: Method 1:**\n   - Dismantle 1 unit of machine A into 2 units of part X and 1 unit of part Y.\n   - New state:\n     - Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n     - Parts: X = 3, Y = 1, Z = 1\n\n8. **Method 2:**\n   - Dismantle 2 units of machine B into 1 unit of part X.\n   - We have 0 units of B, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n9. **Method 3:**\n   - Dismantle 2 units of machine C into 1 unit of part Y.\n   - We have 0 units of C, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n10. **Method 4:**\n    - Combine 1 unit of machine B and 1 unit of machine C into 1 unit of machine A.\n    - We have 0 units of B and C, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n11. **Method 5:**\n    - Combine 1 unit of part X and 1 unit of part Y into 1 unit of part Z.\n    - New state:\n      - Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n      - Parts: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\n12. **Cycle Restart: Method 1:**\n    - Dismantle 1 unit of machine A into 2 units of part X and 1 unit of part Y.\n    - We have 0 units of A, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n13. **Method 2:**\n    - Dismantle 2 units of machine B into 1 unit of part X.\n    - We have 0 units of B, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n14. **Method 3:**\n    - Dismantle 2 units of machine C into 1 unit of part Y.\n    - We have 0 units of C, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n15. **Method 4:**\n    - Combine 1 unit of machine B and 1 unit of machine C into 1 unit of machine A.\n    - We have 0 units of B and C, so this method cannot be executed.\n\n16. **Method 5:**\n    - Combine 1 unit of part X and 1 unit of part Y into 1 unit of part Z.\n    - We have 0 units of Y, so this method cannot be executed.\n\nAt this point, no further methods can be executed. The final state is:\n\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 0\n- Parts: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[\"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"2\", \"0\", \"2\"]"
