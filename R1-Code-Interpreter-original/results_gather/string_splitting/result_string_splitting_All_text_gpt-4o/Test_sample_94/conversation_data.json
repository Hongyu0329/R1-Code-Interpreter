  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Two units of machine B can be dismantled into one unit of part X per round.\nMethod 3: Dismantling two machine C units yields one part Y each cycle.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 3 units of Machine A, 5 units of Machine B, and 6 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the dismantling and combining process according to the given methods and initial conditions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 3, B = 5, C = 6\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:**\n   - Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n   - Apply this method 3 times (since we have 3 units of A):\n     - After 1st application: A = 2, X = 2, Y = 1\n     - After 2nd application: A = 1, X = 4, Y = 2\n     - After 3rd application: A = 0, X = 6, Y = 3\n\n3. **Method 2:**\n   - Dismantle two units of machine B into one unit of part X.\n   - Apply this method 2 times (since we have 5 units of B):\n     - After 1st application: B = 3, X = 7\n     - After 2nd application: B = 1, X = 8\n\n4. **Method 3:**\n   - Dismantle two units of machine C into one unit of part Y.\n   - Apply this method 3 times (since we have 6 units of C):\n     - After 1st application: C = 4, Y = 4\n     - After 2nd application: C = 2, Y = 5\n     - After 3rd application: C = 0, Y = 6\n\n5. **Method 4:**\n   - Combine one unit of machine B and one unit of machine C into one unit of machine A.\n   - Cannot apply this method because C = 0.\n\n6. **Method 5:**\n   - Combine one unit of part X and one unit of part Y into one unit of part Z.\n   - Apply this method 6 times (since we have 6 units of X and 6 units of Y):\n     - After 1st application: X = 5, Y = 5, Z = 1\n     - After 2nd application: X = 4, Y = 4, Z = 2\n     - After 3rd application: X = 3, Y = 3, Z = 3\n     - After 4th application: X = 2, Y = 2, Z = 4\n     - After 5th application: X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 5\n     - After 6th application: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 6\n\n7. **Cycle Restart:**\n   - Method 1 cannot be applied because A = 0.\n   - Method 2 cannot be applied because B = 1.\n   - Method 3 cannot be applied because C = 0.\n   - Method 4 cannot be applied because C = 0.\n   - Method 5 cannot be applied because X = 0 or Y = 0.\n\nSince no more methods can be applied, the process ends here.\n\nFinal state:\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 1, C = 0\n- Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 6\n\nThe final answer is: [\"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"6\"]"
