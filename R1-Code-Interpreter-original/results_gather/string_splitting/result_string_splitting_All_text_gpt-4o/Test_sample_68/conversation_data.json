  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Dismantling two machine B units produces one part X each cycle.\nMethod 3: Each round, two machines C break down into one part Y.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 2 units of Machine A, 2 units of Machine B, and 3 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of dismantling and combining machines and parts according to the given methods. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Machines: A = 2, B = 2, C = 3\n   - Parts: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0\n\n2. **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n   - Execute once: A = 1, X = 2, Y = 1\n\n3. **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B to produce one part X.\n   - Execute once: B = 0, X = 3\n\n4. **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one part Y.\n   - Execute once: C = 1, Y = 2\n\n5. **Method 4:** Combine one unit of machine B and one unit of machine C into one unit of machine A.\n   - Cannot execute because B = 0.\n\n6. **Method 5:** Combine one unit of part X and one unit of part Y into one unit of part Z.\n   - Execute twice (since X = 3 and Y = 2): X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 2\n\n7. **Cycle through methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n     - Execute once: A = 0, X = 3, Y = 1\n\n   - **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B to produce one part X.\n     - Cannot execute because B = 0.\n\n   - **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one part Y.\n     - Cannot execute because C = 1.\n\n   - **Method 4:** Combine one unit of machine B and one unit of machine C into one unit of machine A.\n     - Cannot execute because B = 0.\n\n   - **Method 5:** Combine one unit of part X and one unit of part Y into one unit of part Z.\n     - Execute once: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 3\n\n8. **Cycle through methods again:**\n\n   - **Method 1:** Dismantle one unit of machine A into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n     - Cannot execute because A = 0.\n\n   - **Method 2:** Dismantle two units of machine B to produce one part X.\n     - Cannot execute because B = 0.\n\n   - **Method 3:** Dismantle two units of machine C into one part Y.\n     - Cannot execute because C = 1.\n\n   - **Method 4:** Combine one unit of machine B and one unit of machine C into one unit of machine A.\n     - Cannot execute because B = 0.\n\n   - **Method 5:** Combine one unit of part X and one unit of part Y into one unit of part Z.\n     - Cannot execute because Y = 0.\n\nAt this point, no more methods can be executed. The final state is:\n\n- Machines: A = 0, B = 0, C = 1\n- Parts: X = 2, Y = 0, Z = 3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[\"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"0\", \"3\"]"
