  "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:\nMethod 1: One unit of machine A can be dismantled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 2: Two units of machine B can be dismantled into one unit of part X per round.\nMethod 3: Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.\nMethod 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.\nMethod 5: One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z per round.\n\nXiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 3 units of Machine A, 2 units of Machine B, and 3 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?\n\nGenerate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as [\"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\"].\nYour answer:",
