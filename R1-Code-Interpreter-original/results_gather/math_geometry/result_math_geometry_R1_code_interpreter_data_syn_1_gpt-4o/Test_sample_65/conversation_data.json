    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the larger hemisphere-shaped bowl and then distribute that volume evenly among the 27 smaller hemisphere-shaped molds. The volume of a hemisphere is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the hemisphere.\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the larger hemisphere:**\n   - The radius of the larger hemisphere is 1 foot.\n   - Using the formula, the volume \\( V \\) of the larger hemisphere is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi \\]\n\n2. **Distribute the volume among 27 smaller hemispheres:**\n   - Each smaller hemisphere will have a volume of:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{large}}}{27} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\pi}{27} = \\frac{2}{81} \\pi \\]\n\n3. **Find the radius of the smaller hemispheres:**\n   - Let \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\) be the radius of each smaller hemisphere.\n   - Using the volume formula for a hemisphere, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r_{\\text{small}}^3 = \\frac{2}{81} \\pi \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\):**\n   - We can cancel \\(\\pi\\) from both sides and solve for \\( r_{\\text{small}}^3 \\):\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{small}}^3 = \\frac{1}{27} \\]\n\n- Taking the cube root of both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{small}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\) using Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the radius of the smaller hemisphere molds\nr_small = (1/27)**(1/3)\nprint(r_small)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the radius of each smaller mold.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is approximately 0.3333. This value represents the radius of each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds in feet.\n\nTherefore, the radius of each smaller mold is approximately:\n\n<<<0.3333>>>"
