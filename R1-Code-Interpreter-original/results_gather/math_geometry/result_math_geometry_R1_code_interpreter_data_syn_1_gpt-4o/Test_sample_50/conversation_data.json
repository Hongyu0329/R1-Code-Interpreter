    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region in the regular hexagon. The shaded region is a quadrilateral formed by connecting the midpoints of four sides of the hexagon.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Area of the Regular Hexagon:**\n   A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The area of one equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n   \\]\n   For a hexagon with side length 10 cm:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of hexagon} = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 10^2 = 150\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the Shaded Region:**\n   The shaded region is a quadrilateral formed by connecting the midpoints of four sides of the hexagon. This quadrilateral is a parallelogram because opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region:**\n   The area of the parallelogram can be found by subtracting the areas of the two equilateral triangles that are not part of the shaded region from the total area of the hexagon. Each of these triangles has an area of:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 10^2 = 25\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n   \\]\n   Since there are two such triangles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area of two triangles} = 2 \\times 25\\sqrt{3} = 50\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of shaded region} = 150\\sqrt{3} - 50\\sqrt{3} = 100\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Side length of the hexagon\ns = 10\n\n# Area of the hexagon\narea_hexagon = 6 * (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * s**2\n\n# Area of one equilateral triangle\narea_triangle = (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * s**2\n\n# Area of two triangles\narea_two_triangles = 2 * area_triangle\n\n# Area of the shaded region\narea_shaded = area_hexagon - area_two_triangles\n\n# Output the area of the shaded region in simplest radical form\nprint(f\"{area_shaded / math.sqrt(3)}√3\")\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final answer.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The area of the shaded region is \\(100\\sqrt{3}\\) square centimeters. The slight discrepancy in the decimal part is due to floating-point precision in the computation.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<100√3>>>"
