    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the areas of two concentric circles given the conditions about the arcs formed by angles at the center.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have two concentric circles with a common center P.\n   - A 45-degree angle at P forms an arc on the smaller circle.\n   - A 36-degree angle at P forms an arc on the larger circle.\n   - The lengths of these arcs are equal.\n\n2. **Formulas and Relationships:**\n   - The length of an arc \\( L \\) on a circle is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     L = \\theta \\times r\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle in radians and \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n   - The area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\pi \\times r^2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert Angles to Radians:**\n   - 45 degrees = \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians\n   - 36 degrees = \\(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\) radians\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation for Arc Lengths:**\n   - Let \\( r_1 \\) be the radius of the smaller circle and \\( r_2 \\) be the radius of the larger circle.\n   - The arc length on the smaller circle is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\times r_1\\).\n   - The arc length on the larger circle is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{5} \\times r_2\\).\n   - Since these arc lengths are equal:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\times r_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\times r_2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for the Ratio of Radii:**\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{4}{5}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Find the Ratio of Areas:**\n   - The ratio of the areas of the circles is the square of the ratio of their radii:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the ratio of radii\nr1_r2_ratio = 4 / 5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of areas\narea_ratio = r1_r2_ratio ** 2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(area_ratio)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final answer.",
    "The code output confirms the calculation of the ratio of the areas of the two circles. The ratio is \\( \\frac{16}{25} \\), which is approximately 0.64. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle is:\n\n<<<16/25>>>"
