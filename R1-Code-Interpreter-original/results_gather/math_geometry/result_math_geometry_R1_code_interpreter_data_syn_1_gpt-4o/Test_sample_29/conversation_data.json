    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the cone and how slicing it into pieces affects the volumes of those pieces.\n\n1. **Understanding the Cone and Slices:**\n   - A right circular cone is sliced into four pieces by planes parallel to its base.\n   - All pieces have the same height.\n   - The slices are frustums of the cone, except the topmost piece, which is a smaller cone.\n\n2. **Volume of a Frustum:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a frustum of a cone with height \\( h \\), lower base radius \\( R \\), and upper base radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi h (R^2 + Rr + r^2)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Volume of a Cone:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a cone with base radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\) is:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Radii:**\n   - Since the cone is sliced into four equal-height sections, the height of each section is \\( \\frac{H}{4} \\), where \\( H \\) is the height of the original cone.\n   - The radii of the slices are proportional to their heights from the apex of the cone. If the original cone has a base radius \\( R \\), the radii of the slices from top to bottom are \\( \\frac{R}{4}, \\frac{R}{2}, \\frac{3R}{4}, R \\).\n\n5. **Calculating Volumes:**\n   - The largest piece is the bottom frustum with lower base radius \\( R \\) and upper base radius \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\).\n   - The second-largest piece is the frustum with lower base radius \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\) and upper base radius \\( \\frac{R}{2} \\).\n\n6. **Volume Ratio Calculation:**\n   - We need to calculate the volumes of these two frustums and find their ratio.\n\nLet's calculate the volumes using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbols\nR, H = sp.symbols('R H', positive=True)\n\n# Heights of each section\nh = H / 4\n\n# Radii of the slices\nr1 = R\nr2 = 3*R/4\nr3 = R/2\n\n# Volume of the largest piece (bottom frustum)\nV_largest = (1/3) * sp.pi * h * (r1**2 + r1*r2 + r2**2)\n\n# Volume of the second-largest piece\nV_second_largest = (1/3) * sp.pi * h * (r2**2 + r2*r3 + r3**2)\n\n# Ratio of the volumes\nratio = V_second_largest / V_largest\n\n# Simplify the ratio\nsimplified_ratio = sp.simplify(ratio)\n\nprint(simplified_ratio)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece is approximately 0.513513513513513. To express this as a common fraction, we can convert this decimal to a fraction.\n\nThe decimal 0.513513513513513 is a repeating decimal, which can be expressed as the fraction \\( \\frac{19}{37} \\).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{19}{37}\\)>>>"
