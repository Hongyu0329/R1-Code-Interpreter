    "To compute \\(\\sin 225^\\circ\\), we can use the properties of the unit circle and trigonometric identities. \n\n1. **Understanding the Angle**: \n   - The angle \\(225^\\circ\\) is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n   - In the third quadrant, the sine function is negative.\n\n2. **Reference Angle**:\n   - The reference angle for \\(225^\\circ\\) is \\(225^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 45^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Sine of Reference Angle**:\n   - \\(\\sin 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Sign in the Third Quadrant**:\n   - Since sine is negative in the third quadrant, \\(\\sin 225^\\circ = -\\sin 45^\\circ = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate sine of 225 degrees\nangle_degrees = 225\nangle_radians = math.radians(angle_degrees)\nsine_value = math.sin(angle_radians)\n\nprint(sine_value)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the sine of \\(225^\\circ\\) using Python's math library, which should confirm our manual calculation.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The sine of \\(225^\\circ\\) is approximately \\(-0.7071\\), which matches the value of \\(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n<<<-0.7071>>>"
