    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of reflection over the y-axis. When a point is reflected over the y-axis, the x-coordinate changes its sign, while the y-coordinate remains the same.\n\nGiven:\n- Point \\( A \\) has coordinates \\( (x, 6) \\).\n- When Point \\( A \\) is reflected over the y-axis, it lands on Point \\( B \\).\n\nThe coordinates of Point \\( B \\) after reflection will be:\n- \\( B = (-x, 6) \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the four coordinate values of points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nCoordinates of \\( A \\) are \\( (x, 6) \\).\nCoordinates of \\( B \\) are \\( (-x, 6) \\).\n\nThe sum of the coordinates is:\n\\[ x + 6 + (-x) + 6 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum:\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of A\nx_A = 'x'\ny_A = 6\n\n# Coordinates of B after reflection\nx_B = '-x'\ny_B = 6\n\n# Sum of the coordinates\nsum_of_coordinates = 6 + 6  # x and -x cancel each other out\nprint(sum_of_coordinates)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the sum of the coordinates of points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the sum of the four coordinate values of points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is 12. \n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n- The x-coordinates \\( x \\) and \\(-x\\) cancel each other out when added.\n- The y-coordinates are both 6, so their sum is \\( 6 + 6 = 12 \\).\n\nThus, the sum of the four coordinate values is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
