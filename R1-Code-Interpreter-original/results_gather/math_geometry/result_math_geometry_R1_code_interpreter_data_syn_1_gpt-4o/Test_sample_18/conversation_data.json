    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the shaded region in the diagram. The diagram consists of a circle with two perpendicular diameters, \\(PQ\\) and \\(RS\\), and a square inscribed within the circle. The shaded region is the area outside the square but inside the circle.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Circle Properties:**\n   - The circle has a radius of 4. Therefore, the diameter of the circle is \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n\n2. **Square Properties:**\n   - Since \\(PQ\\) and \\(RS\\) are perpendicular diameters, they form a square with its vertices on the circle.\n   - The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 8.\n\n3. **Calculate the Side of the Square:**\n   - If the diagonal of the square is 8, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length \\(s\\) of the square:\n     \\[\n     s\\sqrt{2} = 8 \\implies s = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Area of the Square:**\n   - The area of the square is \\(s^2 = (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32\\).\n\n5. **Area of the Circle:**\n   - The area of the circle is \\(\\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\\).\n\n6. **Area of the Shaded Region:**\n   - The shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the square:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Shaded Area} = 16\\pi - 32\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the final area of the shaded region using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius = 4\ndiameter = 2 * radius\n\n# Calculate the side of the square\nside_of_square = diameter / math.sqrt(2)\n\n# Calculate the area of the square\narea_of_square = side_of_square ** 2\n\n# Calculate the area of the circle\narea_of_circle = math.pi * radius ** 2\n\n# Calculate the area of the shaded region\nshaded_area = area_of_circle - area_of_square\n\nprint(shaded_area)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the area of the shaded region. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the area of the shaded region. Based on the calculations, the area of the shaded region is approximately 18.27.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18.27>>>"
