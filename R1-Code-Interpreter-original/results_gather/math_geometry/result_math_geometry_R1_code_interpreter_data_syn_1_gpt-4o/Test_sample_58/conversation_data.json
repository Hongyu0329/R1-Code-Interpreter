    "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar triangles. Similar triangles have corresponding sides that are proportional.\n\nFirst, let's identify the sides of the first triangle. We know one side is 21 inches and the hypotenuse is 29 inches. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other side:\n\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs of the triangle, and \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse. Here, \\( b = 21 \\) and \\( c = 29 \\).\n\nLet's calculate the missing side \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a^2 + 21^2 = 29^2 \\]\n\nNext, we will find the scale factor between the two triangles. The hypotenuse of the second triangle is 87 inches, and the hypotenuse of the first triangle is 29 inches. The scale factor \\( k \\) is:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{87}{29} \\]\n\nThe shortest side of the first triangle is \\( a \\). The shortest side of the second triangle will be \\( a \\times k \\).\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nb1 = 21\nc1 = 29\nc2 = 87\n\n# Calculate the missing side a1 using the Pythagorean theorem\na1 = math.sqrt(c1**2 - b1**2)\n\n# Calculate the scale factor\nk = c2 / c1\n\n# Calculate the shortest side of the second triangle\na2 = a1 * k\n\nprint(a2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the length of the shortest side of the second triangle.",
    "The code execution has provided the length of the shortest side of the second triangle as 60.0 inches. This result is derived from the properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe steps involved were:\n1. Calculating the missing side of the first triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.\n2. Determining the scale factor between the two triangles based on their hypotenuses.\n3. Applying the scale factor to the shortest side of the first triangle to find the corresponding side in the second triangle.\n\nThus, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle is:\n\n<<<60.0>>>"
