    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the volume of a cylinder changes when its dimensions are altered. The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nInitially, let's denote the original radius as \\( r \\) and the original height as \\( h \\). The original volume \\( V_{\\text{original}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{original}} = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nNow, according to the problem, the height is doubled, and the radius is increased by 200%. Increasing the radius by 200% means the new radius \\( r_{\\text{new}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{new}} = r + 2r = 3r \\]\n\nThe new height \\( h_{\\text{new}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ h_{\\text{new}} = 2h \\]\n\nThe new volume \\( V_{\\text{new}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{new}})^2 h_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (3r)^2 (2h) \\]\n\nLet's calculate the factor \\( X \\) by which the volume is multiplied:\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{V_{\\text{new}}}{V_{\\text{original}}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( V_{\\text{new}} \\) and \\( V_{\\text{original}} \\):\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{\\pi (3r)^2 (2h)}{\\pi r^2 h} \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nr, h = sp.symbols('r h')\n\n# Original volume\nV_original = sp.pi * r**2 * h\n\n# New dimensions\nr_new = 3 * r\nh_new = 2 * h\n\n# New volume\nV_new = sp.pi * r_new**2 * h_new\n\n# Calculate the factor X\nX = V_new / V_original\n\n# Simplify the expression\nX_simplified = sp.simplify(X)\n\nprint(X_simplified)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the factor \\( X \\) by which the volume is multiplied when the height is doubled and the radius is increased by 200%.",
    "The code output indicates that the factor \\( X \\) by which the volume of the cylinder is multiplied is 18. This means that when the height of the cylinder is doubled and the radius is increased by 200%, the volume of the cylinder becomes 18 times the original volume.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( X \\) is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
