    "To find the area of a triangle given its vertices in a Cartesian coordinate plane, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.\n\nGiven the vertices \\((5, -2)\\), \\((10, 5)\\), and \\((5, 5)\\), we can substitute these into the formula:\n\n- \\(x_1 = 5\\), \\(y_1 = -2\\)\n- \\(x_2 = 10\\), \\(y_2 = 5\\)\n- \\(x_3 = 5\\), \\(y_3 = 5\\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 5(5-5) + 10(5+2) + 5(-2-5) \\right|\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nx1, y1 = 5, -2\nx2, y2 = 10, 5\nx3, y3 = 5, 5\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula\narea = 0.5 * abs(x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2))\n\n# Print the area rounded to the nearest tenth\nprint(round(area, 1))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the area of the triangle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the area of the triangle as 17.5 square units. Therefore, the area of the triangle with vertices at (5, -2), (10, 5), and (5, 5) is:\n\n<<<17.5>>>"
