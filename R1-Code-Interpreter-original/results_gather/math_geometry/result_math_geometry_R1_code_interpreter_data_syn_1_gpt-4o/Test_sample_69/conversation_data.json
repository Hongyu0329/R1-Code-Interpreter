    "To find the total area of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid, we need to calculate the area of one triangular face and then multiply it by four.\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the triangular face:**\n   - The base of each triangular face is the side of the square base, which is 6 units.\n   - The lateral edge of the pyramid is 5 units, which acts as the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the height of the triangular face, half of the base, and the lateral edge.\n\n2. **Calculate the height of the triangular face:**\n   - The height of the triangular face can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The base of the right triangle is half of the base of the pyramid (3 units), and the hypotenuse is the lateral edge (5 units).\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the height of the triangular face. Then, according to the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     h^2 + 3^2 = 5^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h^2 + 9 = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h^2 = 16\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h = 4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of one triangular face:**\n   - The area \\( A \\) of a triangle is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - For one triangular face:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 4 = 12\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total area of the four triangular faces:**\n   - Since there are four identical triangular faces:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Area} = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total area of the four triangular faces is 48 square units.\n\n<<<48>>>"
