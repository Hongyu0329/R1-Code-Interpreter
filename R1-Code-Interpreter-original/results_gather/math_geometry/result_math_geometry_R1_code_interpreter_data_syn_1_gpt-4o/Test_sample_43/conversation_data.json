    "To solve the problem of computing \\(\\tan 0^\\circ\\), we need to understand the definition of the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. \n\nFor the angle \\(0^\\circ\\), the opposite side is 0, and the adjacent side is 1 (considering the unit circle where the radius is 1). Therefore, the tangent of \\(0^\\circ\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\tan 0^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n\\]\n\nTo confirm this calculation, we can use Python to compute the tangent of \\(0^\\circ\\) using the `math` library, which provides trigonometric functions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate tangent of 0 degrees\ntan_0_degrees = math.tan(math.radians(0))\nprint(tan_0_degrees)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the tangent of \\(0^\\circ\\) is indeed 0.0. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0>>>"
