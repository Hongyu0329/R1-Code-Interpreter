    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the perimeter of triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\). We are given that \\( \\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ \\), which means that triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is an isosceles triangle with \\( PQ = PR \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( QR = 5 \\)\n- \\( PR = 7 \\)\n\nSince \\( \\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ \\), it follows that \\( PQ = PR = 7 \\).\n\nThe perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Therefore, the perimeter \\( P \\) of triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P = PQ + QR + PR \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ P = 7 + 5 + 7 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the perimeter of the triangle\nPQ = 7\nQR = 5\nPR = 7\n\nperimeter = PQ + QR + PR\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the perimeter of the triangle.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the perimeter of triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\) as 19. \n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the triangle is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
