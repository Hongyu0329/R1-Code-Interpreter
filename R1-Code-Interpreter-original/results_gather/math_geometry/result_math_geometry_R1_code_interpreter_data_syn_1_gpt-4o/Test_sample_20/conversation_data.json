    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n   - The prism is a right rectangular prism (or a cuboid) with a square base.\n   - The cone is a right circular cone inscribed in the prism, meaning its base is a circle that fits perfectly within the square base of the prism.\n\n2. **Volume of the Prism:**\n   - Let the side length of the square base of the prism be \\( s \\).\n   - Let the height of the prism be \\( h \\).\n   - The volume of the prism \\( V_{\\text{prism}} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{prism}} = s^2 \\times h\n     \\]\n\n3. **Volume of the Cone:**\n   - The base of the cone is a circle inscribed in the square base of the prism. Therefore, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, \\( s \\).\n   - The radius \\( r \\) of the cone's base is \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\).\n   - The height of the cone is the same as the height of the prism, \\( h \\).\n   - The volume of the cone \\( V_{\\text{cone}} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\frac{s^2}{4} h = \\frac{\\pi s^2 h}{12}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Ratio of the Volumes:**\n   - The ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cone}}}{V_{\\text{prism}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi s^2 h}{12}}{s^2 h} = \\frac{\\pi}{12}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{\\pi}{12}>>>"
