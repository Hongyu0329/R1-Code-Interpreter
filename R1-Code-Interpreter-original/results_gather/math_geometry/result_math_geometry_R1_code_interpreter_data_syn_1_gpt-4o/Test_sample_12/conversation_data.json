    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of a sphere that is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of a truncated cone. The truncated cone has two horizontal bases with radii \\( R = 18 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\).\n\nThe sphere is inscribed in the truncated cone, meaning it touches the top and bottom bases and the lateral surface. The height of the truncated cone is not given, but we can use the properties of the geometry to find the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to use the formula for the radius \\( r_s \\) of a sphere inscribed in a truncated cone:\n\n\\[\nr_s = \\frac{R \\cdot r \\cdot h}{\\sqrt{(R - r)^2 + h^2} + R + r}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is the height of the truncated cone. However, since the sphere is tangent to the lateral surface, we can use the fact that the sphere's center lies on the axis of the cone and is equidistant from the top and bottom bases.\n\nTo find the height \\( h \\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, the difference in radii, and the slant height of the cone. However, since the sphere is tangent to the lateral surface, the height \\( h \\) can be expressed in terms of the radii and the radius of the sphere.\n\nLet's set up the equation and solve for the radius of the sphere using Python:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nR = 18\nr = 2\nrs = sp.symbols('rs', positive=True)\n\n# Equation for the radius of the sphere\n# The height h is expressed in terms of the radii and the radius of the sphere\nh = sp.sqrt((R - r)**2 + (R + r - 2*rs)**2)\n\n# Equation for the sphere inscribed in the truncated cone\nequation = sp.Eq(rs, (R * r * h) / (sp.sqrt((R - r)**2 + h**2) + R + r))\n\n# Solve the equation for rs\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, rs)\n\n# Filter the positive solution\npositive_solution = [sol.evalf() for sol in solution if sol.is_real and sol > 0]\n\n# Print the positive solution\nprint(positive_solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the radius of the sphere that is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of the truncated cone. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "It seems the code execution took too long, possibly due to the complexity of the symbolic computation. Let's simplify the approach by directly solving the geometric problem without involving complex symbolic calculations.\n\nGiven the geometry of the problem, the sphere is tangent to both the top and bottom bases and the lateral surface of the truncated cone. The center of the sphere lies on the axis of the cone, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the top and bottom bases is equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe height \\( h \\) of the truncated cone can be expressed in terms of the radii and the radius of the sphere. The slant height \\( l \\) of the truncated cone can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nl = \\sqrt{(R - r)^2 + h^2}\n\\]\n\nThe sphere is tangent to the lateral surface, so the slant height \\( l \\) is equal to the sum of the radii of the sphere and the difference in radii of the bases:\n\n\\[\nl = R - r + 2r_s\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for the radius of the sphere using this relationship:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nR = 18\nr = 2\nrs = sp.symbols('rs', positive=True)\n\n# Equation for the slant height\nl = R - r + 2*rs\n\n# Pythagorean theorem for the slant height\nh = sp.sqrt(l**2 - (R - r)**2)\n\n# Solve for the radius of the sphere\nequation = sp.Eq(l, sp.sqrt((R - r)**2 + h**2))\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, rs)\n\n# Filter the positive solution\npositive_solution = [sol.evalf() for sol in solution if sol.is_real and sol > 0]\n\n# Print the positive solution\nprint(positive_solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code should provide the correct radius of the sphere. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
