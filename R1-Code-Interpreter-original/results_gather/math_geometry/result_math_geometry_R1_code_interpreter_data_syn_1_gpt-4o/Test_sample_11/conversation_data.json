    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a right triangle and the sine function. In a right triangle, the sum of the angles is \\(180^\\circ\\), and one of the angles is \\(90^\\circ\\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\sin D = \\frac{5}{13}\\)\n- \\(\\sin E = 1\\)\n\nSince \\(\\sin E = 1\\), angle \\(E\\) must be \\(90^\\circ\\) because the sine of \\(90^\\circ\\) is 1. Therefore, \\(E\\) is the right angle in triangle \\(DEF\\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\(\\sin F\\). In a right triangle, the sum of the angles \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) is \\(180^\\circ\\). Since \\(E = 90^\\circ\\), we have:\n\\[ D + F = 90^\\circ \\]\n\nThis means that angles \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are complementary, and we can use the identity:\n\\[ \\sin F = \\cos D \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\\[ \\sin D = \\frac{5}{13} \\]\n\nUsing the Pythagorean identity:\n\\[ \\sin^2 D + \\cos^2 D = 1 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\(\\cos D\\):\n\\[ \\cos^2 D = 1 - \\sin^2 D \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\(\\cos D\\) and then find \\(\\sin F\\).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nsin_D = 5 / 13\n\n# Calculate cos D using the Pythagorean identity\ncos_D = math.sqrt(1 - sin_D**2)\n\n# Since sin F = cos D\nsin_F = cos_D\n\nprint(sin_F)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(\\sin F\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and we obtained the value of \\(\\sin F\\) as approximately 0.9230769230769231. This value is derived from the complementary angle relationship in a right triangle, where \\(\\sin F = \\cos D\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.9230769230769231>>>"
