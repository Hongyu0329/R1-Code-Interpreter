    "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of a right rectangular prism given the areas of its three faces. Let's denote the dimensions of the prism as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The areas of the three faces are given by:\n\n1. \\(ab = 24 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\)\n2. \\(bc = 32 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\)\n3. \\(ca = 48 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\)\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of the prism is given by the product of its dimensions: \\(V = abc\\).\n\nTo find \\(abc\\), we can multiply the three equations:\n\n\\[\n(ab)(bc)(ca) = (abc)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given areas:\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 32 \\times 48 = (abc)^2\n\\]\n\nWe can solve for \\(abc\\) by taking the square root of the product of the areas. Let's calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given areas of the faces\nab = 24\nbc = 32\nca = 48\n\n# Calculate the product of the areas\nproduct_of_areas = ab * bc * ca\n\n# Calculate the volume by taking the square root of the product\nvolume = math.sqrt(product_of_areas)\n\n# Output the volume\nprint(volume)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the volume of the prism.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\(192.0\\). This means the volume of the right rectangular prism is \\(192 \\, \\text{cm}^3\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<192.0>>>"
