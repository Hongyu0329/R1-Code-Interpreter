    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a trapezoid and the arithmetic sequence of its angles.\n\n1. **Properties of a Trapezoid:**\n   - A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Arithmetic Sequence:**\n   - An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\nGiven that the angles form an arithmetic sequence and the largest angle is \\(120^\\circ\\), we can denote the angles as \\(a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d\\), where \\(a\\) is the smallest angle and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n3. **Equation Setup:**\n   - Since the largest angle is \\(120^\\circ\\), we have \\(a+3d = 120\\).\n   - The sum of the angles is \\(360^\\circ\\), so:\n     \\[\n     a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) = 360\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     4a + 6d = 360\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Equations:**\n   - We have two equations:\n     1. \\(a + 3d = 120\\)\n     2. \\(4a + 6d = 360\\)\n\nLet's solve these equations to find \\(a\\), the smallest angle.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\na, d = symbols('a d')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(a + 3*d, 120)\neq2 = Eq(4*a + 6*d, 360)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, d))\n\n# Extract the smallest angle\nsmallest_angle = solution[a]\nprint(smallest_angle)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the measure of the smallest angle.",
    "The code execution has provided the result for the smallest angle in the trapezoid. Based on the solution of the system of equations, the smallest angle is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\nTherefore, the measure of the smallest angle in the trapezoid is:\n\n<<<60>>>"
