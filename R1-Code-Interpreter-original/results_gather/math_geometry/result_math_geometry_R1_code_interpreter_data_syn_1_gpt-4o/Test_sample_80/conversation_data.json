    "To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle given that a circle with a radius of 4 cm is tangent to three sides of the rectangle, and the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The circle is tangent to three sides of the rectangle. This implies that the circle is inscribed in a rectangle with one side not touching the circle.\n   - The radius of the circle is 4 cm, so the diameter is 8 cm.\n   - The area of the circle is \\( \\pi \\times r^2 = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Area of the Rectangle:**\n   - The area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle, so it is \\( 2 \\times 16\\pi = 32\\pi \\).\n\n3. **Dimensions of the Rectangle:**\n   - Since the circle is tangent to three sides, one side of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 8 cm.\n   - Let the other side of the rectangle be \\( x \\).\n   - The area of the rectangle is \\( 8 \\times x = 32\\pi \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   - We can solve for \\( x \\) using the equation \\( 8x = 32\\pi \\).\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( x \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given values\ndiameter = 8  # cm\narea_circle = 16 * 3.141592653589793  # 16 * pi\narea_rectangle = 2 * area_circle  # twice the area of the circle\n\n# Calculate the other side of the rectangle\nx = area_rectangle / diameter\n\n# Output the length of the longer side of the rectangle\nprint(x)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of \\( x \\), which is the length of the longer side of the rectangle.",
    "The code output indicates that the length of the longer side of the rectangle is approximately 12.57 cm. However, since the problem asks for the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\), we should express the result as a multiple of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nFrom the calculation, we have:\n\\[ x = \\frac{32\\pi}{8} = 4\\pi \\]\n\nThus, the length of the longer side of the rectangle is \\(4\\pi\\) cm.\n\n<<<4\\pi>>>"
