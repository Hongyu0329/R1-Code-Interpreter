    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the common chord of two overlapping circles. Each circle has a radius of 10 cm, and each circle passes through the center of the other.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - The centers of the two circles are 10 cm apart because each circle passes through the center of the other.\n   - The common chord is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the two circles and bisects it.\n\n2. **Using the Right Triangle**:\n   - The line joining the centers of the circles is the base of two right triangles formed by the radii and the chord.\n   - Each triangle has:\n     - One side as half the chord length (let's call it \\( x \\)).\n     - The other side as the distance from the center of a circle to the midpoint of the chord (let's call it \\( y \\)).\n     - The hypotenuse as the radius of the circle (10 cm).\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - For one of the right triangles, we have:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n     \\]\n   - The distance between the centers of the circles is 10 cm, and the midpoint of the chord is 5 cm from each center (since it bisects the line joining the centers).\n   - Therefore, \\( y = 5 \\) cm.\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Substitute \\( y = 5 \\) into the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 5^2 = 10^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 25 = 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 75\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Length of the Chord**:\n   - Since \\( x \\) is half the length of the chord, the full length of the chord is \\( 2x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Chord length} = 2 \\times 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius = 10\ndistance_between_centers = 10\n\n# Calculate the half-length of the chord using Pythagorean theorem\ny = distance_between_centers / 2\nx_squared = radius**2 - y**2\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# Full length of the chord\nchord_length = 2 * x\n\n# Output the chord length in simplest radical form\nprint(f\"{chord_length:.2f}\")\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the length of the common chord.\n\n<<<10√3>>>",
    "The code output of 17.32 confirms the calculation of the chord length as \\(10\\sqrt{3}\\). The decimal approximation of \\(10\\sqrt{3}\\) is indeed approximately 17.32. \n\nTherefore, the length of the common chord in simplest radical form is:\n\n<<<10√3>>>"
