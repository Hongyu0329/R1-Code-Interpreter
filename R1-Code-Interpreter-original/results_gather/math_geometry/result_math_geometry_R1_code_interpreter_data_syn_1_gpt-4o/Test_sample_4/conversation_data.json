    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the volume of the cube to the volume of the square-based pyramid and solve for the height \\( h \\).\n\n1. **Volume of the Cube**: \n   The volume \\( V \\) of a cube with edge length \\( a \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3\n   \\]\n   For a cube with edge length 4 units:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cube}} = 4^3 = 64 \\text{ cubic units}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the Square-based Pyramid**:\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a square-based pyramid with base edge length \\( b \\) and height \\( h \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times b^2 \\times h\n   \\]\n   For a pyramid with base edge length 8 units:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 8^2 \\times h = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 64 \\times h = \\frac{64}{3} \\times h\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equating the Volumes**:\n   Since the volumes are equal:\n   \\[\n   64 = \\frac{64}{3} \\times h\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( h \\)**:\n   We can solve the equation for \\( h \\) by isolating \\( h \\) on one side of the equation.\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( h \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nvolume_cube = 64  # Volume of the cube\nbase_edge_length = 8  # Base edge length of the pyramid\n\n# Calculate the height of the pyramid\nh = (3 * volume_cube) / (base_edge_length ** 2)\nprint(h)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( h \\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( h \\) as 3.0. This means that the height of the square-based pyramid is 3 units.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3.0>>>"
