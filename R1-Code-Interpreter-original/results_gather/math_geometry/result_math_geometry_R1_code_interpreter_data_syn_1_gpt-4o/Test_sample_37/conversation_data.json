    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of isosceles triangles with integer side lengths that have a perimeter of 23. An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length, say \\(a\\), and a third side, say \\(b\\). The perimeter condition gives us:\n\n\\[ 2a + b = 23 \\]\n\nAdditionally, for these to form a valid triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality conditions:\n\n1. \\(a + a > b\\) or \\(2a > b\\)\n2. \\(a + b > a\\) or \\(b > 0\\)\n3. \\(a + b > a\\) or \\(b > 0\\)\n\nFrom the perimeter equation, we can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ b = 23 - 2a \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the triangle inequality \\(2a > b\\), we get:\n\n\\[ 2a > 23 - 2a \\]\n\\[ 4a > 23 \\]\n\\[ a > 5.75 \\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\(a\\) is 6.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum possible value for \\(a\\). Since \\(b\\) must be positive, we have:\n\n\\[ 23 - 2a > 0 \\]\n\\[ 23 > 2a \\]\n\\[ a < 11.5 \\]\n\nThus, the largest integer value for \\(a\\) is 11.\n\nNow, we will iterate over the possible integer values of \\(a\\) from 6 to 11 and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions. Let's write a Python script to calculate this.\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nfor a in range(6, 12):\n    b = 23 - 2 * a\n    if b > 0 and 2 * a > b:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code will count the number of valid isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 23.",
    "The code has successfully executed and returned the output. Based on the logic and calculations, there are 6 different isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 23.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
