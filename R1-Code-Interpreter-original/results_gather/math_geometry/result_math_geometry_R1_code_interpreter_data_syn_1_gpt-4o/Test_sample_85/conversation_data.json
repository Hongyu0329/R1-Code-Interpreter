    "To determine the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to consider both the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular ends.\n\n1. **Lateral Surface Area**: The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2 \\pi r h\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\n2. **Area of the Two Ends**: Each end of the cylinder is a circle, and the area of a circle is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one end} = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Since there are two ends, the total area for the ends is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Area of Ends} = 2 \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Surface Area**: The total surface area of the cylinder is the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the two ends:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Surface Area} = 2 \\pi r h + 2 \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Height \\( h = 10 \\)\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\)\n\nLet's calculate the total surface area using these values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius = 3\nheight = 10\n\n# Calculate lateral surface area\nlateral_surface_area = 2 * math.pi * radius * height\n\n# Calculate area of the two ends\nends_area = 2 * math.pi * radius**2\n\n# Calculate total surface area\ntotal_surface_area = lateral_surface_area + ends_area\n\n# Output the total surface area\nprint(total_surface_area)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the total surface area of the cylinder.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the total surface area of the cylinder. The result is approximately 245.04422698000386. \n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<245.04>>>"
