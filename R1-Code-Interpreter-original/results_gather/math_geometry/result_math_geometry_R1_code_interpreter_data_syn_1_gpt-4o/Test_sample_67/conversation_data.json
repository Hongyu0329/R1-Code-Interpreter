    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of \\( WZ \\) in the right triangle \\( \\triangle XYZ \\) with a perpendicular from \\( X \\) to \\( YZ \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\triangle XYZ \\) is right-angled at \\( X \\).\n- \\( YX = 60 \\)\n- \\( XZ = 80 \\)\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of \\( YZ \\) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nYZ = \\sqrt{YX^2 + XZ^2} = \\sqrt{60^2 + 80^2}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of points \\( Y, X, Z, \\) and \\( W \\) based on the given information. Since \\( \\triangle XYZ \\) is right-angled at \\( X \\), we can assume:\n- \\( Y = (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( X = (36, 48) \\) (since \\( YX = 60 \\) and \\( XZ = 80 \\), and the coordinates satisfy the Pythagorean theorem)\n- \\( Z = (100, 0) \\) (since \\( XZ = 80 \\) and \\( Z \\) is on the x-axis)\n\nThe point \\( W \\) is on \\( YZ \\) such that \\( WX \\) is perpendicular to \\( YZ \\). Since \\( YZ \\) is horizontal, \\( W \\) must have the same x-coordinate as \\( X \\), which is 36. Therefore, \\( W = (36, 0) \\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance \\( WZ \\) using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nWZ = \\sqrt{(Z_x - W_x)^2 + (Z_y - W_y)^2}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nY = (0, 0)\nX = (36, 48)\nZ = (100, 0)\nW = (36, 0)\n\n# Calculate the length of YZ\nYZ = math.sqrt(60**2 + 80**2)\n\n# Calculate the length of WZ\nWZ = math.sqrt((Z[0] - W[0])**2 + (Z[1] - W[1])**2)\n\nprint(WZ)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the length of \\( WZ \\) and provide the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the length of \\( WZ \\) is 64.0. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<64.0>>>"
