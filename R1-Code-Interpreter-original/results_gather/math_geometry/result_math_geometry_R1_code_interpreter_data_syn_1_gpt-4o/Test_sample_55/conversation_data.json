    "To solve this problem, we can use the Power of a Point theorem. The Power of a Point theorem states that if two chords intersect at a point inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal. \n\nGiven:\n- \\( AP = 8 \\)\n- \\( PC = 1 \\)\n- \\( BD = 6 \\)\n- \\( BP < DP \\)\n\nWe need to find \\( BP \\).\n\nAccording to the Power of a Point theorem:\n\\[ AP \\cdot PC = BP \\cdot PD \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ 8 \\cdot 1 = BP \\cdot PD \\]\n\\[ 8 = BP \\cdot PD \\]\n\nWe also know that:\n\\[ BP + PD = BD = 6 \\]\n\nLet's denote \\( BP = x \\). Then \\( PD = 6 - x \\).\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\\[ 8 = x \\cdot (6 - x) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 8 = 6x - x^2 \\]\n\nRearranging gives us a quadratic equation:\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of \\( x \\), which represents \\( BP \\).\n\nLet's solve this quadratic equation using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients of the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\na = 1\nb = -6\nc = 8\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the two possible solutions\nx1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\nx2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# Since BP < DP, we choose the smaller value\nBP = min(x1, x2)\n\nprint(BP)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\( BP \\).",
    "The code execution has provided us with the value of \\( BP \\). Given the conditions of the problem and the solution of the quadratic equation, the value of \\( BP \\) is 2.0. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2.0>>>"
