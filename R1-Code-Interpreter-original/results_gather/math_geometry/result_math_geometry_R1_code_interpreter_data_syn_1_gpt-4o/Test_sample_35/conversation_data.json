    "To find the area of the interior region formed by the lines \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), and the \\( y \\)-axis, we need to determine the points of intersection of these lines and the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n1. **Find the intersection of the lines with the \\( y \\)-axis:**\n   - For \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\) to find the \\( y \\)-intercept: \\( y = -4 \\).\n   - For \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\) to find the \\( y \\)-intercept: \\( y = 16 \\).\n\n2. **Find the intersection of the two lines:**\n   - Set \\( 2x - 4 = -3x + 16 \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the triangle formed by these points:**\n   - The vertices of the triangle are the intersection points of the lines and the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\nLet's calculate these intersections and the area using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations of the lines\nline1 = Eq(y, 2*x - 4)\nline2 = Eq(y, -3*x + 16)\n\n# Find the intersection of the two lines\nintersection = solve((line1, line2), (x, y))\n\n# Find the y-intercepts\ny_intercept_line1 = solve(line1.subs(x, 0), y)[0]\ny_intercept_line2 = solve(line2.subs(x, 0), y)[0]\n\n# Vertices of the triangle\nvertices = [(0, y_intercept_line1), (0, y_intercept_line2), (intersection[x], intersection[y])]\n\n# Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula:\n# Area = 0.5 * | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |\nx1, y1 = vertices[0]\nx2, y2 = vertices[1]\nx3, y3 = vertices[2]\n\narea = 0.5 * abs(x1*(y2 - y3) + x2*(y3 - y1) + x3*(y1 - y2))\n\nprint(area)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the area of the triangle formed by the lines and the \\( y \\)-axis. Let's execute it to find the area.",
