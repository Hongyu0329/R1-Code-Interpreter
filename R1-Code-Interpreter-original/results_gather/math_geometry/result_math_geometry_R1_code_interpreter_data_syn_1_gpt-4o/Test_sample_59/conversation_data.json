    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of an octagon inscribed in a square where the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. Given that the perimeter of the square is 108 centimeters, we can first determine the side length of the square.\n\n1. **Calculate the side length of the square:**\n   - The perimeter of a square is given by \\(4 \\times \\text{side length}\\).\n   - Therefore, the side length of the square is \\(108 \\div 4 = 27\\) centimeters.\n\n2. **Understand the trisection of the square's sides:**\n   - Since the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square, each side of the square is divided into three equal parts.\n   - Each segment on the side of the square is \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\) centimeters.\n\n3. **Determine the geometry of the octagon:**\n   - The octagon is formed by cutting off four right-angled triangles from the corners of the square.\n   - Each triangle has legs of length 9 centimeters (since the vertices trisect the sides).\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the octagon:**\n   - The area of the square is \\(27 \\times 27 = 729\\) square centimeters.\n   - The area of one right-angled triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 9 \\times 9 = 40.5\\) square centimeters.\n   - Since there are four such triangles, the total area removed is \\(4 \\times 40.5 = 162\\) square centimeters.\n   - Therefore, the area of the octagon is \\(729 - 162 = 567\\) square centimeters.\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given perimeter of the square\nperimeter_square = 108\n\n# Calculate side length of the square\nside_length_square = perimeter_square / 4\n\n# Calculate the length of each segment after trisection\nsegment_length = side_length_square / 3\n\n# Calculate the area of the square\narea_square = side_length_square ** 2\n\n# Calculate the area of one right-angled triangle\narea_triangle = 0.5 * segment_length * segment_length\n\n# Total area removed by four triangles\ntotal_area_removed = 4 * area_triangle\n\n# Calculate the area of the octagon\narea_octagon = area_square - total_area_removed\n\nprint(area_octagon)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed that the area of the octagon is indeed 567 square centimeters. \n\nTherefore, the number of square centimeters in the area of the octagon is:\n\n<<<567>>>"
