    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a triangular prism and then find their sum.\n\n1. **Triangular Prism Properties**:\n   - A triangular prism has two triangular bases and three rectangular lateral faces.\n   - **Faces**: It has 5 faces in total (2 triangular + 3 rectangular).\n   - **Vertices**: Each triangular base has 3 vertices, and since there are two bases, the total number of vertices is 6.\n   - **Edges**: Each triangular base has 3 edges, and there are 3 additional edges connecting the corresponding vertices of the two bases. Thus, the total number of edges is 9.\n\n2. **Sum Calculation**:\n   - Sum of faces, edges, and vertices = Number of faces + Number of edges + Number of vertices.\n\nLet's calculate this sum using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Number of faces, edges, and vertices in a triangular prism\nfaces = 5\nedges = 9\nvertices = 6\n\n# Calculate the sum\ntotal_sum = faces + edges + vertices\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_sum)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sum of the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a triangular prism.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output, which is the sum of the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a triangular prism.\n\nThe sum is calculated as follows:\n- Number of faces = 5\n- Number of edges = 9\n- Number of vertices = 6\n\nTotal sum = 5 + 9 + 6 = 20\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
