    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the \"WIN\" sector of the circular spinner. The probability of winning is given as \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), which means that the \"WIN\" sector covers \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the total area of the circle.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total area of the circle using the formula for the area of a circle, \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle. Given that the radius is 10 cm, the total area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi \\times 10^2 = 100\\pi \\, \\text{sq cm} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the \"WIN\" sector by multiplying the total area by the probability of winning:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of WIN sector} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100\\pi \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nradius = 10\nprobability_of_winning = 2 / 5\n\n# Total area of the circle\ntotal_area = 3.14159 * radius**2\n\n# Area of the WIN sector\nwin_area = probability_of_winning * total_area\n\nprint(win_area)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the area of the \"WIN\" sector in terms of \\(\\pi\\). \n\nThe final answer will be expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\) as required by the problem statement. \n\n<<<40\\pi>>>",
    "The code output provides a numerical approximation of the area of the \"WIN\" sector, but the problem requires the answer to be expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\). Let's break down the calculation:\n\n1. The total area of the circle is \\(100\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n2. The \"WIN\" sector covers \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the circle.\n3. Therefore, the area of the \"WIN\" sector is \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100\\pi = 40\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n\nThe code output of 125.6636 is the numerical approximation of \\(40\\pi\\) when \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\).\n\nThus, the final answer, expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\), is:\n\n<<<40\\pi>>>"
