    "To determine the number of different integer lengths the third side of a triangle can be, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), where \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 7\\), and \\(c\\) is the unknown side. According to the triangle inequality theorem, the following conditions must be satisfied:\n\n1. \\(a + b > c\\)\n2. \\(a + c > b\\)\n3. \\(b + c > a\\)\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n1. \\(5 + 7 > c\\)  which simplifies to \\(c < 12\\)\n2. \\(5 + c > 7\\)  which simplifies to \\(c > 2\\)\n3. \\(7 + c > 5\\)  which simplifies to \\(c > -2\\) (this condition is always true since \\(c > 2\\))\n\nThus, the possible integer values for \\(c\\) are those that satisfy \\(2 < c < 12\\). Therefore, \\(c\\) can be any integer from 3 to 11, inclusive.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of possible integer values for \\(c\\).\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of integer values for the third side of the triangle\npossible_c_values = list(range(3, 12))\nnumber_of_possible_c_values = len(possible_c_values)\nprint(number_of_possible_c_values)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the number of different integer lengths the third side can be.",
    "The code execution confirms that there are 9 possible integer values for the third side of the triangle. These values are the integers from 3 to 11, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of different integer lengths the third side can be is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
