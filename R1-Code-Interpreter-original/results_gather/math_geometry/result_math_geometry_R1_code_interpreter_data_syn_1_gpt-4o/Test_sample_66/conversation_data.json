    "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of angle \\( \\angle QRC \\) in the triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\) with an incircle centered at \\( C \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are given two angles of the triangle: \\( \\angle PQR = 63^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle QPR = 59^\\circ \\).\n   - We need to find the third angle \\( \\angle QRP \\) using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Third Angle:**\n   - The sum of angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR \\).\n\n3. **Properties of the Incircle:**\n   - The incircle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.\n   - The incenter \\( C \\) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.\n\n4. **Finding \\( \\angle QRC \\):**\n   - Since \\( C \\) is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisector of \\( \\angle QRP \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\angle QRP \\).\n\nLet's calculate the required angles using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given angles\nangle_PQR = 63\nangle_QPR = 59\n\n# Calculate the third angle of the triangle\nangle_QRP = 180 - angle_PQR - angle_QPR\n\n# Calculate the angle QRC\nangle_QRC = angle_QRP / 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(angle_QRC)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the measure of \\( \\angle QRC \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for \\( \\angle QRC \\). Based on the calculations:\n\n- We found \\( \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ = 58^\\circ \\).\n- Since \\( C \\) is the incenter, \\( \\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 58^\\circ = 29^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the measure of \\( \\angle QRC \\) is \\( 29^\\circ \\).\n\n<<<29.0>>>"
