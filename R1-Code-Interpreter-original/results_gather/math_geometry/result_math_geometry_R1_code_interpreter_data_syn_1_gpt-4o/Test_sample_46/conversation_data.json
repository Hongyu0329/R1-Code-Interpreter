    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the surface area of the solid $CXYZ$, which is the part of the prism that was sliced off. The solid $CXYZ$ is a tetrahedron with vertices $C$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and their coordinates:**\n   - The base of the prism is an equilateral triangle with side length 12. We can place the triangle in the coordinate plane for simplicity:\n     - $A = (0, 0, 0)$\n     - $B = (12, 0, 0)$\n     - $C = (6, 6\\sqrt{3}, 0)$\n   - The height of the prism is 16, so the coordinates of the corresponding points on the other base are:\n     - $D = (6, 6\\sqrt{3}, 16)$\n     - $E = (0, 0, 16)$\n     - $F = (12, 0, 16)$\n\n2. **Find the midpoints $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:**\n   - $X$ is the midpoint of $AC$: $X = \\left(\\frac{0+6}{2}, \\frac{0+6\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\\right) = (3, 3\\sqrt{3}, 0)$\n   - $Y$ is the midpoint of $BC$: $Y = \\left(\\frac{12+6}{2}, \\frac{0+6\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\\right) = (9, 3\\sqrt{3}, 0)$\n   - $Z$ is the midpoint of $DC$: $Z = \\left(\\frac{6+6}{2}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{3}+6\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{0+16}{2}\\right) = (6, 6\\sqrt{3}, 8)$\n\n3. **Calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron $CXYZ$:**\n   - The faces of the tetrahedron are triangles: $CXY$, $CYZ$, $CXZ$, and $XYZ$.\n   - We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given vertices $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, $(x_3, y_3, z_3)$:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{(x_2y_3 + x_3y_1 + x_1y_2 - x_3y_2 - x_1y_3 - x_2y_1)^2 + (x_2z_3 + x_3z_1 + x_1z_2 - x_3z_2 - x_1z_3 - x_2z_1)^2 + (y_2z_3 + y_3z_1 + y_1z_2 - y_3z_2 - y_1z_3 - y_2z_1)^2}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compute the areas using Python:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3):\n    a = x2*y3 + x3*y1 + x1*y2 - x3*y2 - x1*y3 - x2*y1\n    b = x2*z3 + x3*z1 + x1*z2 - x3*z2 - x1*z3 - x2*z1\n    c = y2*z3 + y3*z1 + y1*z2 - y3*z2 - y1*z3 - y2*z1\n    return 0.5 * math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2 + c**2)\n\n# Coordinates of the points\nC = (6, 6*math.sqrt(3), 0)\nX = (3, 3*math.sqrt(3), 0)\nY = (9, 3*math.sqrt(3), 0)\nZ = (6, 6*math.sqrt(3), 8)\n\n# Calculate the area of each face\narea_CXY = triangle_area(*C, *X, *Y)\narea_CYZ = triangle_area(*C, *Y, *Z)\narea_CXZ = triangle_area(*C, *X, *Z)\narea_XYZ = triangle_area(*X, *Y, *Z)\n\n# Total surface area of the tetrahedron CXYZ\ntotal_surface_area = area_CXY + area_CYZ + area_CXZ + area_XYZ\n\nprint(total_surface_area)\n```\n\nThe code will compute the areas of the triangles and sum them to find the total surface area of the tetrahedron $CXYZ$. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the total surface area of the solid $CXYZ$ is approximately 92.21. \n\nTherefore, the surface area of the solid $CXYZ$, the part that was sliced off, is:\n\n<<<92.21>>>"
