    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere in which the rectangular box \\( P \\) is inscribed. We are given:\n\n1. The surface area of the box \\( P \\) is 384.\n2. The sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the box as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\n\n1. The surface area of the box: \n   \\[\n   2(ab + bc + ca) = 384\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   ab + bc + ca = 192\n   \\]\n\n2. The sum of the lengths of the edges:\n   \\[\n   4(a + b + c) = 112\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = 28\n   \\]\n\nSince the box is inscribed in the sphere, the diagonal of the box is equal to the diameter of the sphere. The diagonal \\( d \\) of the box is given by:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\n\\]\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is half of the diagonal:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\), we can use the identity:\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n28^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2 \\times 192\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) and then find \\( r \\).\n\n```python\n# Given values\nsurface_area = 384\nsum_of_edges = 112\n\n# Calculate ab + bc + ca\nab_bc_ca = surface_area / 2\n\n# Calculate a + b + c\na_b_c = sum_of_edges / 4\n\n# Calculate (a + b + c)^2\na_b_c_squared = a_b_c ** 2\n\n# Calculate a^2 + b^2 + c^2\na2_b2_c2 = a_b_c_squared - 2 * ab_bc_ca\n\n# Calculate the radius r\nimport math\nr = math.sqrt(a2_b2_c2) / 2\n\nprint(r)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of \\( r \\).",
    "The code execution has provided us with the value of the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere. Based on the calculations and the given conditions, the radius \\( r \\) is 10.0.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10.0>>>"
