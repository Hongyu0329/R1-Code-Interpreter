    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the chord \\( BC \\) in the circle. We are given the following information:\n\n1. \\( AD \\) is a diameter of the circle.\n2. \\( ABC \\) is a chord.\n3. \\( BO = 5 \\).\n4. \\( \\angle ABO = 60^\\circ \\).\n5. The arc \\( CD = 60^\\circ \\).\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Since \\( AD \\) is a diameter, the radius \\( r \\) of the circle is half the length of \\( AD \\). However, we don't have the length of \\( AD \\) directly, but we know \\( BO = 5 \\), which is a radius of the circle. Therefore, \\( r = 5 \\).\n\n2. The angle \\( \\angle ABO = 60^\\circ \\) is given. Since \\( BO \\) is a radius, triangle \\( ABO \\) is an isosceles triangle with \\( AB = BO = 5 \\).\n\n3. We need to find the length of \\( BC \\). To do this, we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\nLet's calculate the length of \\( BC \\) using the Law of Cosines:\n\n\\[\nBC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC \\cdot \\cos(\\angle BAC)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\angle BAC = \\angle ABO = 60^\\circ \\), and \\( AB = AC = 5 \\) (as both are radii of the circle), we can substitute these values into the formula.\n\nNow, let's compute the length of \\( BC \\) using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nAB = 5\nAC = 5\nangle_BAC = 60  # in degrees\n\n# Convert angle to radians for cosine function\nangle_BAC_rad = math.radians(angle_BAC)\n\n# Use the Law of Cosines to find BC\nBC_squared = AB**2 + AC**2 - 2 * AB * AC * math.cos(angle_BAC_rad)\nBC = math.sqrt(BC_squared)\n\nprint(BC)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the length of \\( BC \\) using the given information and the Law of Cosines. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is approximately 5. This result is expected due to the precision of floating-point arithmetic in Python. The length of \\( BC \\) is essentially 5.\n\nGiven the context and the calculations, the length of the chord \\( BC \\) is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
