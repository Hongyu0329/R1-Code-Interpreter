    "To determine how many cubic feet of snow Khali has to shovel, we need to calculate the volume of the snow on the sidewalk. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the snow layer) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nIn this case:\n- The length of the sidewalk is 20 feet.\n- The width of the sidewalk is 2 feet.\n- The depth (or height) of the snow is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot.\n\nLet's calculate the volume using these dimensions.\n\n```python\n# Define the dimensions of the sidewalk and the snow depth\nlength = 20  # feet\nwidth = 2    # feet\ndepth = 0.5  # feet (1/2 foot)\n\n# Calculate the volume of snow\nvolume_of_snow = length * width * depth\n\n# Output the result\nprint(volume_of_snow)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the volume of snow in cubic feet.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the volume of snow that Khali has to shovel. The volume is 20.0 cubic feet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20.0>>>"
