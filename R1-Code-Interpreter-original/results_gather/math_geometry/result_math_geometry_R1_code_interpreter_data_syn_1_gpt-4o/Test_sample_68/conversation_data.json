    "To find the area of the hexagon, we need to analyze the given diagram and determine the coordinates of the vertices of the hexagon. The hexagon is defined by the points: (0,0), (1,3), (3,3), (4,0), (3,-3), and (1,-3).\n\nThe hexagon can be divided into simpler geometric shapes, such as triangles and rectangles, to calculate the area. We can use the shoelace formula (or Gauss's area formula) to find the area of a polygon when the coordinates of its vertices are known.\n\nThe shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices \\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) + (x_n y_1 - y_n x_1) \\right|\n\\]\n\nLet's apply this formula to the hexagon with the given vertices.\n\n```python\n# Define the vertices of the hexagon\nvertices = [(0, 0), (1, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (3, -3), (1, -3)]\n\n# Initialize sums for the shoelace formula\nsum1 = 0\nsum2 = 0\n\n# Calculate the sums\nn = len(vertices)\nfor i in range(n):\n    x1, y1 = vertices[i]\n    x2, y2 = vertices[(i + 1) % n]  # Next vertex, wrapping around\n    sum1 += x1 * y2\n    sum2 += y1 * x2\n\n# Calculate the area using the shoelace formula\narea = 0.5 * abs(sum1 - sum2)\n\n# Output the area\nprint(area)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the area of the hexagon.",
