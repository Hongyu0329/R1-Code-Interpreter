    "To find the total volume of the snowballs used to make the snowman, we need to calculate the volume of each spherical snowball and then sum them up. The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nKadin uses three snowballs with radii 2 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches. We will calculate the volume for each of these snowballs and then add them together.\n\nLet's calculate the volumes:\n\n1. Volume of the snowball with radius 2 inches:\n   \\[\n   V_1 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (2)^3\n   \\]\n\n2. Volume of the snowball with radius 3 inches:\n   \\[\n   V_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3\n   \\]\n\n3. Volume of the snowball with radius 5 inches:\n   \\[\n   V_3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3\n   \\]\n\nThe total volume \\( V_{\\text{total}} \\) is the sum of these individual volumes:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3\n\\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the radii\nradii = [2, 3, 5]\n\n# Calculate the total volume\ntotal_volume = sum((4/3) * math.pi * (r**3) for r in radii)\n\n# Print the total volume in terms of pi\nprint(total_volume / math.pi)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total volume of the snowballs in terms of \\(\\pi\\). Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the total volume of the snowballs in terms of \\(\\pi\\). The output is approximately 213.33 when expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nTherefore, the total volume of snow used, in cubic inches, is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = 213.33\\pi\n\\]\n\n<<<213.33\\pi>>>"
