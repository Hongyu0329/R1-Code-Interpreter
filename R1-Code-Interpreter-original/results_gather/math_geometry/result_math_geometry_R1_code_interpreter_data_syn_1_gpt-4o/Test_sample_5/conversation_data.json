    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of an isosceles triangle and the sum of angles in a triangle.\n\n1. **Properties of an Isosceles Triangle**: In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these equal sides are also equal.\n\n2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**: The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nGiven:\n- One of the angles opposite an equal side is \\(40^\\circ\\).\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles, the other angle opposite the equal side is also \\(40^\\circ\\).\n\nLet's denote the angles of the triangle as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), where \\(A = B = 40^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Finding the Largest Angle**: The largest angle will be the angle opposite the base, which is not equal to the other two angles. This angle can be found using the sum of angles in a triangle:\n\n\\[\nA + B + C = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n40^\\circ + 40^\\circ + C = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\nC = 180^\\circ - 80^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest angle in the triangle is \\(100^\\circ\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given angles in the isosceles triangle\nangle_A = 40\nangle_B = 40\n\n# Calculate the third angle\nangle_C = 180 - (angle_A + angle_B)\n\n# Output the largest angle\nlargest_angle = max(angle_A, angle_B, angle_C)\nprint(largest_angle)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the largest angle. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<100>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output confirms that the largest angle in the isosceles triangle is indeed \\(100^\\circ\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<100>>>"
