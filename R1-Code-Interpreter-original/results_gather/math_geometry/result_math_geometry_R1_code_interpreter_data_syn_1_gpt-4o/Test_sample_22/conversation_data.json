    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the gray region between two concentric circles. The key information given is:\n\n1. The radius of the outer circle is twice the radius of the inner circle.\n2. The width of the gray region is 2 feet.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( r \\) as the radius of the inner circle.\n- \\( R \\) as the radius of the outer circle.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- \\( R = 2r \\)\n- The width of the gray region is \\( R - r = 2 \\) feet.\n\nGiven \\( R = 2r \\), we can substitute into the width equation:\n\\[ 2r - r = 2 \\]\n\\[ r = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( R \\):\n\\[ R = 2r = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the gray region, which is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle:\n- Area of the outer circle: \\( \\pi R^2 = \\pi (4)^2 = 16\\pi \\)\n- Area of the inner circle: \\( \\pi r^2 = \\pi (2)^2 = 4\\pi \\)\n\nThe area of the gray region is:\n\\[ \\text{Area of gray region} = 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi \\]\n\nThus, the area of the gray region is \\( 12\\pi \\) square feet.\n\n<<<12\\pi>>>"
