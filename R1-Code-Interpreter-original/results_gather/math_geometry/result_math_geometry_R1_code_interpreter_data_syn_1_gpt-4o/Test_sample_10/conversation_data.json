    "To find the height of the cylinder, we can use the formula for the total surface area of a cylinder:\n\n\\[ SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Radius \\( r = 2 \\) feet\n- Total surface area \\( SA = 12\\pi \\) square feet\n\nWe need to find the height \\( h \\).\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\n\\[ 12\\pi = 2\\pi (2)^2 + 2\\pi (2)h \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 12\\pi = 8\\pi + 4\\pi h \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ 12\\pi - 8\\pi = 4\\pi h \\]\n\n\\[ 4\\pi = 4\\pi h \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( 4\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ h = 1 \\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nr = 2\nSA = 12 * math.pi\n\n# Calculate height\nh = (SA - 2 * math.pi * r**2) / (2 * math.pi * r)\n\nprint(h)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the height of the cylinder.",
    "The code execution confirms that the height of the cylinder is indeed 1.0 feet. The calculation was performed correctly, and the result matches our manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, the height of the cylinder is:\n\n<<<1.0>>>"
