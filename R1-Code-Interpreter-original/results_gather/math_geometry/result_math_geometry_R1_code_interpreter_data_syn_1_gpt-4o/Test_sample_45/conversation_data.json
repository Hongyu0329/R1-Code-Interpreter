    "To find the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius) of triangle \\(ABC\\), we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{A}{s}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the area of the triangle and \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s\\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{5 + 6 + 7}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the area \\(A\\) of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 6\\), and \\(c = 7\\).\n\nLet's calculate the area \\(A\\) using Heron's formula and then find the inradius \\(r\\).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Side lengths\na = 5\nb = 6\nc = 7\n\n# Semi-perimeter\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n# Area using Heron's formula\nA = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n\n# Inradius\nr = A / s\n\nprint(r)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of the inradius \\(r\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is approximately 1.632993161855452. This is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\) with sides \\(AB = 5\\), \\(AC = 6\\), and \\(BC = 7\\).\n\nTo express this in simplest radical form, we recognize that the decimal 1.632993161855452 is equivalent to \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the radius of the inscribed circle is:\n\n<<<\\sqrt{3}>>>"
