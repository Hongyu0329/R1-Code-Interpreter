    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of an equilateral triangle given the area of its inscribed circle. \n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have an equilateral triangle ABC.\n   - O is the center of the inscribed circle (incircle).\n   - The area of the circle is given as \\(4\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n\n2. **Finding the Radius of the Circle:**\n   - The area of a circle is given by the formula \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - We know \\( \\pi r^2 = 4\\pi \\).\n   - Solving for \\( r \\), we get \\( r^2 = 4 \\) which implies \\( r = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Relating the Radius to the Side of the Triangle:**\n   - For an equilateral triangle, the radius \\( r \\) of the incircle is related to the side length \\( s \\) by the formula:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n     \\]\n   - We have \\( r = 2 \\), so:\n     \\[\n     2 = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( s \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Triangle:**\n   - The area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( s = 4\\sqrt{3} \\):\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (4\\sqrt{3})^2\n     \\]\n\nLet's compute the area using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Side length of the triangle\ns = 4 * math.sqrt(3)\n\n# Area of the equilateral triangle\narea = (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * s**2\n\nprint(area)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the area of the triangle.",
    "The code output indicates that the area of the triangle is approximately 20.7846 square centimeters. However, we need to express the area in its simplest radical form.\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. We found the side length \\( s = 4\\sqrt{3} \\).\n2. The area of the triangle is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (4\\sqrt{3})^2\n   \\]\n3. Simplifying the expression:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 16 \\times 3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\times 48}{4} = 12\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle ABC in simplest radical form is \\( 12\\sqrt{3} \\) square centimeters.\n\n<<<12âˆš3>>>"
