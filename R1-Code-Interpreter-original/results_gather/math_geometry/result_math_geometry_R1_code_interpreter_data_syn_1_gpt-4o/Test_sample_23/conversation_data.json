    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the triangles \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and \\( \\triangle CEF \\).\n\n1. **Identify the Midpoints**: \n   - \\( E \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AC} \\).\n   - \\( F \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AB} \\).\n\n2. **Properties of Midpoints**:\n   - Since \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are midpoints, \\( \\overline{EF} \\) is parallel to \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and \\( \\overline{EF} \\) is half the length of \\( \\overline{BC} \\) by the Midsegment Theorem.\n\n3. **Area Relationship**:\n   - The line segment \\( \\overline{EF} \\) divides \\( \\triangle ABC \\) into two smaller triangles, \\( \\triangle AEF \\) and \\( \\triangle CEF \\).\n   - Since \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are midpoints, \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is similar to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with a scale factor of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of the scale factor of similarity.\n   - Therefore, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n5. **Compute the Area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\)**:\n   - Given that the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is 24 square units, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6 \\) square units.\n\nThus, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is 6 square units.\n\n<<<6>>>"
