    "To solve this problem, we need to find the y-coordinate of the third vertex of an equilateral triangle with two given vertices at \\((0,5)\\) and \\((8,5)\\). The third vertex is in the first quadrant.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: \n   - The given vertices \\((0,5)\\) and \\((8,5)\\) are on a horizontal line, which is the base of the equilateral triangle.\n   - The length of the side of the equilateral triangle is the distance between these two points, which is 8 units.\n\n2. **Properties of an Equilateral Triangle**:\n   - All sides are equal.\n   - The height of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Height} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times \\text{Side length}\n     \\]\n   - For a side length of 8, the height is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Height} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 8 = 4\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Position of the Third Vertex**:\n   - The third vertex will be directly above the midpoint of the base if it is in the first quadrant.\n   - The midpoint of the base \\((0,5)\\) and \\((8,5)\\) is \\((4,5)\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the y-coordinate**:\n   - The y-coordinate of the third vertex is the y-coordinate of the midpoint plus the height of the triangle.\n   - Therefore, the y-coordinate is:\n     \\[\n     5 + 4\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure the expression is in its simplest radical form.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the height of the equilateral triangle\nside_length = 8\nheight = (sp.sqrt(3) / 2) * side_length\n\n# Calculate the y-coordinate of the third vertex\ny_coordinate = 5 + height\n\n# Simplify the expression\nsimplified_y_coordinate = sp.simplify(y_coordinate)\n\nprint(simplified_y_coordinate)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the y-coordinate in its simplest radical form.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the y-coordinate of the third vertex in its simplest radical form. \n\nThe y-coordinate of the third vertex of the equilateral triangle is:\n\n<<<5 + 4âˆš3>>>"
