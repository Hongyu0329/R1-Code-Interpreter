    "To find the ratio of the areas of the two triangles, we can use Heron's formula to calculate the area of each triangle. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) with sides 5, 12, and 13.\n\n1. Calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s_{ABC}\\):\n   \\[\n   s_{ABC} = \\frac{5 + 12 + 13}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle \\(ABC\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{ABC} = \\sqrt{15(15-5)(15-12)(15-13)}\n   \\]\n\nNext, calculate the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) with sides 8, 15, and 17.\n\n1. Calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s_{DEF}\\):\n   \\[\n   s_{DEF} = \\frac{8 + 15 + 17}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. Use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle \\(DEF\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{DEF} = \\sqrt{20(20-8)(20-15)(20-17)}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the areas of triangle \\(ABC\\) to triangle \\(DEF\\).\n\nLet's compute these values using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Triangle ABC\na_abc, b_abc, c_abc = 5, 12, 13\ns_abc = (a_abc + b_abc + c_abc) / 2\narea_abc = math.sqrt(s_abc * (s_abc - a_abc) * (s_abc - b_abc) * (s_abc - c_abc))\n\n# Triangle DEF\na_def, b_def, c_def = 8, 15, 17\ns_def = (a_def + b_def + c_def) / 2\narea_def = math.sqrt(s_def * (s_def - a_def) * (s_def - b_def) * (s_def - c_def))\n\n# Ratio of areas\nratio = area_abc / area_def\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the ratio of the areas of the two triangles.",
    "The code execution has provided the ratio of the areas of the two triangles as 0.5. This means that the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is half the area of triangle \\(DEF\\).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) to the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)>>>"
