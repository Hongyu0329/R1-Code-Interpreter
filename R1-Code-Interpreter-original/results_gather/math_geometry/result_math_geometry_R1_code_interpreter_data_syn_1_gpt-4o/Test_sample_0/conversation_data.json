    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the original square ABCD.**  \n   Since the area of the square is 4 square units, the side length \\( s \\) of the square is given by:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 4 \\implies s = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coordinates of the vertices of the original square.**  \n   The center of the square is at \\((8, -8)\\). Since the top side is horizontal, the vertices of the square can be calculated as follows:\n   - Top-left vertex: \\((8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7)\\)\n   - Top-right vertex: \\((8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7)\\)\n   - Bottom-left vertex: \\((8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9)\\)\n   - Bottom-right vertex: \\((8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9)\\)\n\n3. **Dilate the square with a scale factor of 2 centered at the origin (0,0).**  \n   The dilation of a point \\((x, y)\\) with a scale factor \\( k \\) centered at the origin is given by \\((kx, ky)\\). Here, \\( k = 2 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the new coordinates of the vertices after dilation.**  \n   - Dilated top-left vertex: \\((2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -7) = (14, -14)\\)\n   - Dilated top-right vertex: \\((2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -7) = (18, -14)\\)\n   - Dilated bottom-left vertex: \\((2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -9) = (14, -18)\\)\n   - Dilated bottom-right vertex: \\((2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -9) = (18, -18)\\)\n\n5. **Determine which vertex is farthest from the origin.**  \n   The distance from the origin to a point \\((x, y)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\). We need to calculate this distance for each vertex and find the maximum.\n\nLet's calculate these distances using Python to find the vertex that is farthest from the origin.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Original vertices after dilation\nvertices = [(14, -14), (18, -14), (14, -18), (18, -18)]\n\n# Calculate distances from the origin\ndistances = [(x, y, math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)) for x, y in vertices]\n\n# Find the vertex with the maximum distance\nfarthest_vertex = max(distances, key=lambda item: item[2])\n\n# Output the farthest vertex\nprint(farthest_vertex[:2])\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will determine which vertex is farthest from the origin.",
    "The code execution has provided the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin after dilation. \n\nThe vertex that is farthest from the origin is \\((18, -18)\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(18, -18)>>>"
