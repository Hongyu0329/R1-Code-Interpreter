    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\( x \\) first, and then use it to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The perimeter of the triangle is given as 36, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 7 + (x + 4) + (2x + 1) = 36 \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation will allow us to solve for \\( x \\). Once we have \\( x \\), we can calculate the lengths of the sides and determine which one is the longest.\n\nLet's solve the equation:\n\n\\[ 7 + x + 4 + 2x + 1 = 36 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 3x + 12 = 36 \\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3x = 24 \\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( x = 8 \\), we can find the lengths of the sides:\n\n- First side: 7\n- Second side: \\( x + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 \\)\n- Third side: \\( 2x + 1 = 2(8) + 1 = 17 \\)\n\nThe longest side is the one with the greatest length, which is 17.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nperimeter = 36\nside1 = 7\n\n# Solve for x\nx = (perimeter - side1 - 4 - 1) / 3\n\n# Calculate the lengths of the sides\nside2 = x + 4\nside3 = 2 * x + 1\n\n# Determine the longest side\nlongest_side = max(side1, side2, side3)\n\nprint(longest_side)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the value of \\( x \\), determine the lengths of the sides, and find the longest side. Let's execute it to confirm our solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed that the longest side of the triangle is 17. Therefore, the length of the longest side of the triangle is:\n\n<<<17>>>"
