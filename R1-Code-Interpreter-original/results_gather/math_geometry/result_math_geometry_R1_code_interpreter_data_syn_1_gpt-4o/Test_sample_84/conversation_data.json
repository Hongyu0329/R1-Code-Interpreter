    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle. We are given that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( r \\) as the radius of the circle.\n- \\( s \\) as the side length of the square.\n\nSince each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius, we can use the geometry of the circle to find the relationship between \\( s \\) and \\( r \\).\n\n### Step 1: Relationship between the chord and the radius\nFor a chord of length \\( r \\) in a circle of radius \\( r \\), the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, half the chord, and the perpendicular distance. \n\nThe half-length of the chord is \\( \\frac{r}{2} \\). Let \\( d \\) be the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ d^2 + \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2 = r^2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( d \\):\n\\[ d^2 = r^2 - \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ d^2 = r^2 - \\frac{r^2}{4} \\]\n\\[ d^2 = \\frac{3r^2}{4} \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{2} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Relationship between the side of the square and the radius\nThe side of the square \\( s \\) is twice the perpendicular distance \\( d \\) because the square is symmetric about the center of the circle. Therefore:\n\\[ s = 2d = 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{2} = \\sqrt{3}r \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the areas\n- The area of the square \\( A_{\\text{square}} \\) is:\n  \\[ A_{\\text{square}} = s^2 = (\\sqrt{3}r)^2 = 3r^2 \\]\n\n- The area of the circle \\( A_{\\text{circle}} \\) is:\n  \\[ A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Ratio of the areas\nThe ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{A_{\\text{square}}}{A_{\\text{circle}}} = \\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2} = \\frac{3}{\\pi} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is \\(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{3}{\\pi}>>>"
