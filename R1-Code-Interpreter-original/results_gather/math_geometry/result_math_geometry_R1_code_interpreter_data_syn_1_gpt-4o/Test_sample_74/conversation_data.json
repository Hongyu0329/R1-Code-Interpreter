    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the circle and the angles involved. \n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n   - \\(AB\\) is a diameter of the circle, so \\(\\angle AEB = 90^\\circ\\) because the angle subtended by a diameter on the circle is a right angle.\n   - Given \\(\\angle BAE = 43^\\circ\\), we can find \\(\\angle ABE\\) as \\(90^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 47^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Tangent Properties:**\n   - The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Therefore, \\(\\angle EBC = 90^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle EDC = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Finding \\(\\angle CED\\):**\n   - Since \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are points where tangents intersect, \\(\\angle CED\\) is the angle between the tangents at \\(E\\) and \\(B\\).\n   - The angle between two tangents from a point outside the circle is equal to the angle subtended by the line segment joining the points of tangency at the center of the circle. Therefore, \\(\\angle CED = \\angle AEB\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\(\\angle AEB = 90^\\circ\\), \\(\\angle CED = 90^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<90>>>"
