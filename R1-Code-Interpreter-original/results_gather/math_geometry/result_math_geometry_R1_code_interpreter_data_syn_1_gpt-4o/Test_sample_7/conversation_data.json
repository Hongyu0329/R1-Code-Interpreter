    "To find the volume of one piece of the pizza, we need to first calculate the total volume of the pizza and then divide it by the number of pieces.\n\n1. **Calculate the total volume of the pizza:**\n   - The pizza is a cylinder with a diameter of 12 inches and a thickness (height) of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inch.\n   - The radius \\(r\\) of the pizza is half of the diameter, so \\(r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\) inches.\n   - The formula for the volume \\(V\\) of a cylinder is given by:\n     \\[\n     V = \\pi r^2 h\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values, we have:\n     \\[\n     V = \\pi \\times 6^2 \\times \\frac{1}{3}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of one piece:**\n   - The pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, so the volume of one piece is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume of one piece} = \\frac{V}{12}\n     \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ndiameter = 12\nthickness = 1/3\nnumber_of_pieces = 12\n\n# Calculate radius\nradius = diameter / 2\n\n# Calculate total volume of the pizza\ntotal_volume = math.pi * (radius ** 2) * thickness\n\n# Calculate volume of one piece\nvolume_of_one_piece = total_volume / number_of_pieces\n\n# Output the result\nprint(volume_of_one_piece)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the volume of one piece of the pizza in terms of \\(\\pi\\).",
    "The code output indicates that the volume of one piece of the pizza is \\(3.141592653589793\\) cubic inches. This result is in terms of \\(\\pi\\), which means the volume of one piece is actually \\(\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\pi>>>"
