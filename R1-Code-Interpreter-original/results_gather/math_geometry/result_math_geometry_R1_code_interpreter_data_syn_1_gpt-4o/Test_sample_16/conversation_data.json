    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the diagonal \\( DA \\) in a regular hexagon. The hexagon is regular, meaning all its sides are equal, and all its internal angles are 120 degrees.\n\nGiven that the side length of the hexagon is 10 units, we can use the properties of a regular hexagon to find the length of the diagonal \\( DA \\).\n\nIn a regular hexagon, there are two types of diagonals:\n1. The shorter diagonal, which spans two sides of the hexagon.\n2. The longer diagonal, which spans three sides of the hexagon.\n\nThe diagonal \\( DA \\) in this problem is the longer diagonal, as it connects two opposite vertices of the hexagon.\n\nThe length of the longer diagonal in a regular hexagon is twice the side length. This is because the longer diagonal is equivalent to the diameter of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon.\n\nLet's calculate the length of the diagonal \\( DA \\) using this property.\n\n```python\n# Given side length of the hexagon\nside_length = 10\n\n# The longer diagonal in a regular hexagon is twice the side length\nlonger_diagonal = 2 * side_length\n\n# Output the length of the diagonal\nprint(longer_diagonal)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the length of the diagonal \\( DA \\).",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is 20. This confirms that the length of the diagonal \\( DA \\) in the regular hexagon is 20 units.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
