    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total surface area of a hemisphere given that the area of its base is \\(100\\pi\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The base of the hemisphere is a circle, and its area is given by the formula \\( \\pi r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n   - We are given that the area of the base is \\( 100\\pi \\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\pi r^2 = 100\\pi\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( r^2 \\), we divide both sides by \\(\\pi\\):\n     \\[\n     r^2 = 100\n     \\]\n   - Taking the square root of both sides, we find:\n     \\[\n     r = 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Surface Area of the Hemisphere:**\n   - The total surface area of a hemisphere includes the curved surface area and the base area.\n   - The curved surface area of a hemisphere is given by \\( 2\\pi r^2 \\).\n   - The base area is already given as \\( 100\\pi \\).\n   - Therefore, the total surface area \\( A \\) is:\n     \\[\n     A = 2\\pi r^2 + \\pi r^2 = 3\\pi r^2\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( r^2 = 100 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     A = 3\\pi \\times 100 = 300\\pi\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Given base area of the hemisphere\nbase_area = 100 * 3.141592653589793\n\n# Calculate radius squared\nr_squared = base_area / 3.141592653589793\n\n# Calculate total surface area\ntotal_surface_area = 3 * 3.141592653589793 * r_squared\n\n# Print the total surface area in terms of pi\nprint(f\"{total_surface_area / 3.141592653589793}π\")\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the total surface area in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n<<<300π>>>",
    "The code executed correctly and confirmed that the total surface area of the hemisphere is \\(300\\pi\\). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<300π>>>"
