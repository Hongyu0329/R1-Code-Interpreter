    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the third circle that is tangent to two given circles and one of their common external tangents.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( r_1 = 1 \\) as the radius of the first circle centered at \\( A \\).\n- \\( r_2 = 4 \\) as the radius of the second circle centered at \\( B \\).\n- \\( r_3 \\) as the radius of the third circle we need to find.\n\nThe centers of the first two circles are separated by a distance equal to the sum of their radii because they are externally tangent. Therefore, the distance between the centers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\( r_1 + r_2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\).\n\nThe third circle is tangent to both circles and the common external tangent. The problem can be solved using Descartes' Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures (reciprocals of the radii) of four mutually tangent circles. The theorem states:\n\n\\[\n(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)^2 = 2(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2)\n\\]\n\nFor our problem:\n- \\( k_1 = \\frac{1}{r_1} = 1 \\)\n- \\( k_2 = \\frac{1}{r_2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n- \\( k_3 = \\frac{1}{r_3} \\)\n- \\( k_4 = 0 \\) (since the line can be considered as a circle with infinite radius, hence zero curvature)\n\nSubstituting these into Descartes' Circle Theorem:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{r_3})^2 = 2(1^2 + (\\frac{1}{4})^2 + (\\frac{1}{r_3})^2)\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation for \\( r_3 \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the symbol for the unknown radius\nr3 = symbols('r3', positive=True)\n\n# Define the curvatures\nk1 = 1\nk2 = 1/4\nk3 = 1/r3\nk4 = 0\n\n# Descartes' Circle Theorem equation\nequation = (k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)**2 - 2*(k1**2 + k2**2 + k3**2 + k4**2)\n\n# Solve for r3\nsolution = solve(equation, r3)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code will solve the equation and provide the possible values for \\( r_3 \\). Let's execute it to find the radius of the third circle.",
    "The code output provides two possible solutions for \\( r_3 \\): 0.444444444444444 and 4.00000000000000. \n\nSince the third circle is tangent to both the first circle (radius 1) and the second circle (radius 4), and it is also tangent to their common external tangent, the radius of the third circle must be smaller than both of the given circles. Therefore, the valid solution is the smaller radius.\n\nThus, the radius of the third circle is:\n\n<<<0.444444444444444>>>"
