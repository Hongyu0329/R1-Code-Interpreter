    "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the smaller pyramid that is cut off by the plane parallel to the base of the original pyramid.\n\n1. **Determine the height of the original pyramid:**\n   - The base of the pyramid is a square with side length \\(8\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - The slant height of the pyramid is 10 units.\n   - The height of the pyramid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, half the diagonal of the base, and the slant height.\n\n2. **Calculate the diagonal of the base:**\n   - The diagonal \\(d\\) of the square base is given by \\(d = \\sqrt{(8\\sqrt{2})^2 + (8\\sqrt{2})^2} = 16\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the height of the original pyramid:**\n   - The height \\(h\\) of the pyramid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: \\(h = \\sqrt{10^2 - (8)^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\\).\n\n4. **Determine the height of the smaller pyramid:**\n   - The plane cuts the pyramid 3 units above the base, so the height of the smaller pyramid is \\(6 - 3 = 3\\).\n\n5. **Determine the side length of the base of the smaller pyramid:**\n   - The smaller pyramid is similar to the original pyramid, and its height is half of the original pyramid's height.\n   - Therefore, the side length of the base of the smaller pyramid is also half of the original base, which is \\(8\\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{3}{6} = 4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the volume of the smaller pyramid:**\n   - The volume \\(V\\) of a pyramid is given by \\(V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}\\).\n   - The base area of the smaller pyramid is \\((4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32\\).\n   - The volume of the smaller pyramid is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 32 \\times 3\\).\n\nLet's calculate the volume using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the volume of the smaller pyramid\nbase_side_length = 4 * (2**0.5)\nbase_area = base_side_length**2\nheight_smaller_pyramid = 3\nvolume_smaller_pyramid = (1/3) * base_area * height_smaller_pyramid\n\nprint(volume_smaller_pyramid)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the volume of the smaller pyramid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the volume of the smaller pyramid is 32.0 cubic units. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<32.0>>>"
