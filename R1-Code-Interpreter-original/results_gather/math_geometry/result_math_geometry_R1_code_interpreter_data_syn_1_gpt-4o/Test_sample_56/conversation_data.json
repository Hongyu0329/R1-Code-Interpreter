    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of \\( QS \\) in the given right triangle \\( \\triangle SQR \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\cos R = \\frac{4}{9} \\)\n- \\( SR = 9 \\)\n\nIn a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. Here, \\( \\cos R = \\frac{QR}{SR} = \\frac{4}{9} \\).\n\nFrom this, we can find \\( QR \\):\n\\[ QR = \\cos R \\times SR = \\frac{4}{9} \\times 9 = 4 \\]\n\nNow, we have:\n- \\( QR = 4 \\)\n- \\( SR = 9 \\)\n\nWe need to find \\( QS \\), which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \\( \\triangle SQR \\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ QS^2 = QR^2 + SR^2 \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( QS \\) using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nQR = 4\nSR = 9\n\n# Using Pythagorean theorem to find QS\nQS = (QR**2 + SR**2)**0.5\n\n# Output the result\nprint(QS)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the length of \\( QS \\).",
