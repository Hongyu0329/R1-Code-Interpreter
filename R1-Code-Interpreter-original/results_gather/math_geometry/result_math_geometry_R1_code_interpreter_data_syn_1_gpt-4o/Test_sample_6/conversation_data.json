    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of segment \\( AB \\) in the given triangle. We have two triangles, and we are given the side lengths and the angle between two sides in each triangle.\n\nFor the first triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), we have:\n- \\( AB = 6 \\) cm\n- \\( BC = 14 \\) cm\n- \\( AC = 10 \\) cm\n- \\(\\angle A = 120^\\circ\\)\n\nFor the second triangle \\( \\triangle DEF \\), we have:\n- \\( DE = 3 \\) cm\n- \\( EF = 5 \\) cm\n- \\(\\angle D = 120^\\circ\\)\n\nThe triangles are similar because they have the same angles (\\(120^\\circ\\) and the other two angles are equal due to the sum of angles in a triangle being \\(180^\\circ\\)). Therefore, the sides of the triangles are proportional.\n\nThe ratio of the sides of the triangles can be used to find the unknown side \\( AB \\).\n\nLet's denote the sides of the first triangle as \\( a = 6 \\), \\( b = 14 \\), and \\( c = 10 \\), and the sides of the second triangle as \\( a' = 3 \\), \\( b' = 5 \\).\n\nThe ratio of the sides of the triangles is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{a'} = \\frac{b}{b'} = \\frac{c}{c'}\n\\]\n\nWe can use the ratio of the sides to find the length of segment \\( AB \\).\n\nLet's calculate the length of segment \\( AB \\) using the ratio of the sides.\n\n```python\n# Given side lengths of the triangles\na = 6\nb = 14\nc = 10\na_prime = 3\nb_prime = 5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the sides\nratio = a / a_prime\n\n# Calculate the length of segment AB using the ratio\nAB = b_prime * ratio\n\n# Output the length of segment AB\nprint(AB)\n```",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \\(10.0\\). This means that the length of segment \\(AB\\) is \\(10\\) cm. \n\nThe reasoning behind this is based on the similarity of the two triangles, which allows us to use the ratio of corresponding sides to find the unknown length.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10.0>>>"
