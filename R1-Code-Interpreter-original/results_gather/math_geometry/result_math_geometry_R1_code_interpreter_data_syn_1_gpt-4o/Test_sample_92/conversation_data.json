    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of side \\( AC \\) in the right triangle \\( ABC \\) given that \\( \\cos{C} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130} \\) and the hypotenuse \\( AB = \\sqrt{130} \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Triangle:**\n   - In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.\n   - Here, \\( \\cos{C} = \\frac{AC}{AB} \\).\n\n2. **Given Values:**\n   - \\( \\cos{C} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130} \\)\n   - \\( AB = \\sqrt{130} \\)\n\n3. **Setting up the Equation:**\n   - From the definition of cosine, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{AC}{\\sqrt{130}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( AC \\):**\n   - Multiply both sides by \\( \\sqrt{130} \\) to isolate \\( AC \\):\n     \\[\n     AC = \\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130} \\times \\sqrt{130}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - The expression simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     AC = \\frac{9 \\times 130}{130}\n     \\]\n   - This further simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     AC = 9\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given values\ncos_C = (9 * (130**0.5)) / 130\nAB = 130**0.5\n\n# Calculate AC\nAC = cos_C * AB\n\n# Output the result\nprint(AC)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should get the value of \\( AC \\).\n\n<<<9.0>>>",
    "The slight discrepancy in the output is due to floating-point precision errors, which are common in numerical computations. However, the result is effectively 9, as expected from the mathematical simplification.\n\nTherefore, the length of \\( AC \\) is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
