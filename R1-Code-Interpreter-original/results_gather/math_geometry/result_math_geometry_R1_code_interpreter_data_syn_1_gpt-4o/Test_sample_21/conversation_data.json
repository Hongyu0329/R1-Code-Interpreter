    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the shaded region formed by semicircles of diameter 2 inches lined up over a 1-foot (12 inches) length.\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:**\n   - Each semicircle has a diameter of 2 inches, which means the radius is 1 inch.\n   - The semicircles are arranged such that the top half of one semicircle is followed by the bottom half of the next semicircle, creating a continuous wave-like pattern.\n\n2. **Calculating the Area of One Semicircle:**\n   - The area of a full circle with radius \\( r \\) is \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - Therefore, the area of a semicircle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - For a semicircle with radius 1 inch, the area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Number of Semicircles in 1 Foot:**\n   - Since each semicircle has a diameter of 2 inches, the number of semicircles that fit in 12 inches is \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Shaded Area:**\n   - The shaded region is formed by the top halves of the semicircles.\n   - Since there are 6 semicircles, the total shaded area is \\( 6 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 3\\pi \\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Constants\ndiameter = 2  # inches\nradius = diameter / 2\nlength_in_inches = 12  # 1 foot = 12 inches\n\n# Area of one semicircle\narea_of_one_semicircle = (1/2) * 3.141592653589793 * (radius ** 2)\n\n# Number of semicircles in 1 foot\nnumber_of_semicircles = length_in_inches / diameter\n\n# Total shaded area\ntotal_shaded_area = number_of_semicircles * area_of_one_semicircle\n\nprint(total_shaded_area)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will verify the result and provide the final answer.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output confirms our manual calculation. The total shaded area in a 1-foot length of the pattern is \\( 3\\pi \\) square inches. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3\\pi>>>"
