    "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone.\n\nGiven:\n- Diameter of the cone = 10 cm, so the radius \\( r = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) cm.\n- Height \\( h = 6 \\) cm.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (5)^2 (6) \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius = 5  # in cm\nheight = 6  # in cm\n\n# Volume of the cone\nvolume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n\n# Expressing the volume in terms of pi\nvolume_in_terms_of_pi = (1/3) * (radius ** 2) * height\n\nprint(volume_in_terms_of_pi)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the volume in terms of \\(\\pi\\).",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is approximately 50. This result represents the volume of the cone in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cone is \\(50\\pi\\) cubic centimeters.\n\n<<<50\\pi>>>"
