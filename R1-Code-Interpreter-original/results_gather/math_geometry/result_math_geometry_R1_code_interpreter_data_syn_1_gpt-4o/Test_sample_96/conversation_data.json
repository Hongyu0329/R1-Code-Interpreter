    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of the larger circle minus the areas of the two smaller circles.\n\n1. **Identify the radii of the circles:**\n   - The two smaller circles have radii of 2 and 3.\n   - The larger circle circumscribes both smaller circles and is tangent to them externally.\n\n2. **Determine the radius of the larger circle:**\n   - Since the smaller circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n   - The center of the larger circle is equidistant from the centers of the two smaller circles. Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is the sum of the radii of the smaller circles: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the area of each circle:**\n   - Area of a circle is given by the formula \\(A = \\pi r^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**\n   - The area of the shaded region is the area of the larger circle minus the areas of the two smaller circles.\n\nLet's calculate these areas using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Radii of the circles\nr1 = 2  # Radius of the first smaller circle\nr2 = 3  # Radius of the second smaller circle\nR = 5   # Radius of the larger circle\n\n# Calculate the areas\narea_large_circle = math.pi * R**2\narea_small_circle1 = math.pi * r1**2\narea_small_circle2 = math.pi * r2**2\n\n# Calculate the shaded area\nshaded_area = area_large_circle - (area_small_circle1 + area_small_circle2)\n\n# Output the shaded area\nprint(shaded_area)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the area of the shaded region.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is approximately 37.69911184307752. However, since the problem asks for the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\), we need to express the shaded area in that form.\n\nLet's break down the calculation:\n\n1. **Area of the larger circle**: \n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{large}} = \\pi \\times 5^2 = 25\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of the first smaller circle**:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{small1}} = \\pi \\times 2^2 = 4\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of the second smaller circle**:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{small2}} = \\pi \\times 3^2 = 9\\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **Area of the shaded region**:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{shaded}} = A_{\\text{large}} - (A_{\\text{small1}} + A_{\\text{small2}})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{shaded}} = 25\\pi - (4\\pi + 9\\pi) = 25\\pi - 13\\pi = 12\\pi\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region is \\(12\\pi\\).\n\n<<<12\\pi>>>"
