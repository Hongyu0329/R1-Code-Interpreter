    "To solve this problem, we need to reflect the point \\( C(-3, 2) \\) over the \\( y \\)-axis to find the coordinates of \\( C' \\). When a point \\((x, y)\\) is reflected over the \\( y \\)-axis, its \\( x \\)-coordinate changes sign, while the \\( y \\)-coordinate remains the same. Therefore, the coordinates of \\( C' \\) will be \\((3, 2)\\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distance between the points \\( C(-3, 2) \\) and \\( C'(3, 2) \\). The distance \\( d \\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) into this formula, we have:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(3 - (-3))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(3 + 3)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{6^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of C and C'\nC = (-3, 2)\nC_prime = (3, 2)\n\n# Calculate the distance\ndistance = math.sqrt((C_prime[0] - C[0])**2 + (C_prime[1] - C[1])**2)\nprint(distance)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should get the distance between \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\).\n\n<<<6.0>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output confirms that the distance between points \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) is indeed 6.0. Therefore, the length of the segment drawn from \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\) is:\n\n<<<6.0>>>"
