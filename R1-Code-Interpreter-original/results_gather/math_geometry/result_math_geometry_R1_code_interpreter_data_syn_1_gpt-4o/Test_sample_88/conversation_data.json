    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) in a right triangle with a 60-degree angle, where the radius of the inscribed circle is given as 6 cm.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Triangle:**\n   - The triangle is a right triangle with one angle being 60 degrees. Therefore, the other non-right angle is 30 degrees.\n   - This is a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n2. **Properties of a 30-60-90 Triangle:**\n   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \\(1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2\\).\n   - The side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) times the shortest side, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.\n\n3. **Inscribed Circle (Incircle) Radius:**\n   - The radius \\(r\\) of the incircle of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{a + b - c}{2}\n     \\]\n     where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the legs, and \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n4. **Using the Given Radius:**\n   - Given \\(r = 6\\), we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     6 = \\frac{a + b - c}{2}\n     \\]\n   - For a 30-60-90 triangle, let the shortest side (opposite 30 degrees) be \\(x\\), then the sides are \\(x\\), \\(x\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(2x\\).\n\n5. **Substitute the Side Lengths:**\n   - Substitute \\(a = x\\), \\(b = x\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(c = 2x\\) into the incircle radius formula:\n     \\[\n     6 = \\frac{x + x\\sqrt{3} - 2x}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     6 = \\frac{x(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     12 = x(\\sqrt{3} - 1)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Rationalize the Denominator:**\n   - To simplify \\(\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\\), multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate \\(\\sqrt{3} + 1\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{12(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}\n     \\]\n   - The denominator becomes:\n     \\[\n     (\\sqrt{3})^2 - (1)^2 = 3 - 1 = 2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{12(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 6(\\sqrt{3} + 1)\n     \\]\n\n7. **Find \\(\\overline{AB}\\):**\n   - \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is the hypotenuse, which is \\(2x\\):\n     \\[\n     \\overline{AB} = 2 \\times 6(\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 12(\\sqrt{3} + 1)\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the final expression for \\(\\overline{AB}\\) in simplest radical form.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the expression\nx = 6 * (sp.sqrt(3) + 1)\nAB = 2 * x\n\n# Simplify the expression\nAB_simplified = sp.simplify(AB)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(AB_simplified)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we get the final answer:\n\n<<<12*sqrt(3) + 12>>>",
