    "To determine the possible whole number values of \\( n \\) that allow the three sticks to form a triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven the sides are 5 cm, 9 cm, and \\( n \\) cm, the inequalities are:\n\n1. \\( 5 + 9 > n \\)\n2. \\( 5 + n > 9 \\)\n3. \\( 9 + n > 5 \\)\n\nLet's solve these inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 5 + 9 > n \\) simplifies to \\( 14 > n \\) or \\( n < 14 \\).\n2. \\( 5 + n > 9 \\) simplifies to \\( n > 4 \\).\n3. \\( 9 + n > 5 \\) simplifies to \\( n > -4 \\), which is always true for positive \\( n \\).\n\nCombining the valid inequalities, we have \\( 4 < n < 14 \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) can be any whole number from 5 to 13 inclusive.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\) from 5 to 13.\n\nLet's calculate this sum using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of integers from 5 to 13\nn_values = range(5, 14)\nsum_n = sum(n_values)\nprint(sum_n)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the sum of all integers from 5 to 13. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\) from 5 to 13. The sum is 81.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\) that allow the sticks to form a triangle is:\n\n<<<81>>>"
