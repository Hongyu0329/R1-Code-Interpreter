    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the original square ABCD.**  \n   The area of the square is given as 4 square units. The side length \\( s \\) of a square is the square root of the area.  \n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coordinates of the vertices of the original square.**  \n   The center of the square is at \\((8, -8)\\). Since the top side is horizontal, the square is aligned with the coordinate axes.  \n   The half-length of the side is \\( \\frac{s}{2} = 1 \\).  \n   Therefore, the vertices of the square are:\n   - Top-right: \\((8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7)\\)\n   - Top-left: \\((8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7)\\)\n   - Bottom-right: \\((8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9)\\)\n   - Bottom-left: \\((8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9)\\)\n\n3. **Dilate the square with a scale factor of 2 centered at the origin (0,0).**  \n   The dilation of a point \\((x, y)\\) with respect to the origin by a scale factor \\( k \\) is given by \\((kx, ky)\\).  \n   Applying this to each vertex:\n   - Top-right: \\((2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -7) = (18, -14)\\)\n   - Top-left: \\((2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -7) = (14, -14)\\)\n   - Bottom-right: \\((2 \\times 9, 2 \\times -9) = (18, -18)\\)\n   - Bottom-left: \\((2 \\times 7, 2 \\times -9) = (14, -18)\\)\n\n4. **Determine which vertex is farthest from the origin.**  \n   The distance from the origin to a point \\((x, y)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).  \n   We need to calculate this distance for each vertex and find the maximum.\n\nLet's calculate these distances using Python code to determine the farthest vertex.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of the dilated vertices\nvertices = [(18, -14), (14, -14), (18, -18), (14, -18)]\n\n# Function to calculate distance from origin\ndef distance_from_origin(x, y):\n    return math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n\n# Calculate distances\ndistances = [distance_from_origin(x, y) for x, y in vertices]\n\n# Find the index of the maximum distance\nmax_index = distances.index(max(distances))\n\n# Get the vertex with the maximum distance\nfarthest_vertex = vertices[max_index]\n\nprint(farthest_vertex)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will determine which vertex is farthest from the origin.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the vertex \\((18, -18)\\) is the farthest from the origin. Let's verify the reasoning and calculations to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Vertices after dilation:**\n   - Top-right: \\((18, -14)\\)\n   - Top-left: \\((14, -14)\\)\n   - Bottom-right: \\((18, -18)\\)\n   - Bottom-left: \\((14, -18)\\)\n\n2. **Distance calculations:**\n   - Distance to \\((18, -14)\\): \\(\\sqrt{18^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 196} = \\sqrt{520}\\)\n   - Distance to \\((14, -14)\\): \\(\\sqrt{14^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 196} = \\sqrt{392}\\)\n   - Distance to \\((18, -18)\\): \\(\\sqrt{18^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 324} = \\sqrt{648}\\)\n   - Distance to \\((14, -18)\\): \\(\\sqrt{14^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 324} = \\sqrt{520}\\)\n\n3. **Comparison of distances:**\n   - \\(\\sqrt{648}\\) is the largest among \\(\\sqrt{520}\\), \\(\\sqrt{392}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{520}\\).\n\nThus, the vertex \\((18, -18)\\) is indeed the farthest from the origin.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<(18, -18)>>>"
