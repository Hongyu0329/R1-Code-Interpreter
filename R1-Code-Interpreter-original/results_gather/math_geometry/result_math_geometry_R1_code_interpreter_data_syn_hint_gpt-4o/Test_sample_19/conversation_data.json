    "To determine the number of diagonals in a cube, we need to consider the different types of diagonals that can exist:\n\n1. **Face Diagonals**: These are diagonals that lie on the faces of the cube. Each face of a cube is a square, and a square has 2 diagonals. Since a cube has 6 faces, the total number of face diagonals is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ faces} \\times 2 \\text{ diagonals per face} = 12 \\text{ face diagonals}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Space Diagonals**: These are diagonals that pass through the interior of the cube, connecting two opposite vertices. A cube has 8 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices by edges and to 3 other vertices by face diagonals. The remaining vertex, which is not connected by an edge or a face diagonal, forms a space diagonal with the original vertex. Therefore, each vertex is part of 1 space diagonal. Since there are 8 vertices, and each space diagonal is counted twice (once from each end), the total number of space diagonals is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8 \\text{ vertices}}{2} = 4 \\text{ space diagonals}\n   \\]\n\nAdding the face diagonals and space diagonals gives the total number of diagonals in the cube:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ face diagonals} + 4 \\text{ space diagonals} = 16 \\text{ diagonals}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of diagonals in a cube is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
