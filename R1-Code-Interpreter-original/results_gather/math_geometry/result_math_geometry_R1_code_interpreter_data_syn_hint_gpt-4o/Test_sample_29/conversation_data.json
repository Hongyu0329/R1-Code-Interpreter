    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the cone and how slicing it into four pieces affects the volumes of those pieces.\n\n1. **Understanding the Cone and Slices:**\n   - A right circular cone is sliced into four pieces by planes parallel to its base.\n   - All pieces have the same height, meaning the height of each slice is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the total height of the cone.\n\n2. **Volume of a Cone:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a cone is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( r \\) is the radius of the base and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone.\n\n3. **Volume of Frustums:**\n   - Each slice is a frustum of a cone, except the topmost piece, which is a smaller cone.\n   - The volume of a frustum of a cone with radii \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) and height \\( h \\) is:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi h (r_1^2 + r_1 r_2 + r_2^2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determining Radii:**\n   - The radii of the slices are proportional to their heights from the apex of the cone.\n   - If the original cone has height \\( H \\) and base radius \\( R \\), the radii of the slices from top to bottom are:\n     - Topmost piece (small cone): \\( \\frac{R}{4} \\)\n     - Second piece: \\( \\frac{R}{2} \\)\n     - Third piece: \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\)\n     - Bottom piece (largest): \\( R \\)\n\n5. **Calculating Volumes:**\n   - We need to calculate the volume of the second-largest piece (third from the top) and the largest piece (bottom piece).\n\n6. **Volume Calculations:**\n   - **Largest Piece (Bottom Frustum):**\n     - Radii: \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\) and \\( R \\)\n     - Height: \\( \\frac{H}{4} \\)\n     - Volume: \n       \\[\n       V_{\\text{largest}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\frac{H}{4} \\left(\\left(\\frac{3R}{4}\\right)^2 + \\frac{3R}{4} \\cdot R + R^2\\right)\n       \\]\n\n   - **Second-Largest Piece (Third Frustum):**\n     - Radii: \\( \\frac{R}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\)\n     - Height: \\( \\frac{H}{4} \\)\n     - Volume:\n       \\[\n       V_{\\text{second-largest}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\frac{H}{4} \\left(\\left(\\frac{R}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{R}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3R}{4} + \\left(\\frac{3R}{4}\\right)^2\\right)\n       \\]\n\n7. **Ratio of Volumes:**\n   - We need to find the ratio \\( \\frac{V_{\\text{second-largest}}}{V_{\\text{largest}}} \\).\n\nLet's calculate these volumes and their ratio using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbols\nR, H = sp.symbols('R H')\n\n# Volume of the largest piece (bottom frustum)\nV_largest = (1/3) * sp.pi * (H/4) * ((3*R/4)**2 + (3*R/4)*R + R**2)\n\n# Volume of the second-largest piece (third frustum)\nV_second_largest = (1/3) * sp.pi * (H/4) * ((R/2)**2 + (R/2)*(3*R/4) + (3*R/4)**2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio\nratio = V_second_largest / V_largest\n\n# Simplify the ratio\nsimplified_ratio = sp.simplify(ratio)\n\nprint(simplified_ratio)\n```\n\nThe code will compute the ratio of the volumes of the second-largest piece to the largest piece.
