    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of the larger circle minus the areas of the two smaller circles.\n\n1. **Identify the radii of the circles:**\n   - The radius of the first smaller circle is 2.\n   - The radius of the second smaller circle is 3.\n   - The larger circle circumscribes both smaller circles.\n\n2. **Determine the radius of the larger circle:**\n   - Since the two smaller circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii, which is \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n   - The center of the larger circle is equidistant from the centers of the two smaller circles. Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is the distance from its center to the center of either smaller circle plus the radius of that smaller circle.\n   - The center of the larger circle is at the midpoint of the line segment joining the centers of the two smaller circles. The distance from this midpoint to either center is \\(\\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\).\n   - Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is \\(2.5 + 3 = 5.5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the areas:**\n   - Area of the larger circle: \\(\\pi \\times (5.5)^2\\).\n   - Area of the first smaller circle: \\(\\pi \\times (2)^2\\).\n   - Area of the second smaller circle: \\(\\pi \\times (3)^2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the shaded area:**\n   - Shaded area = Area of the larger circle - Area of the first smaller circle - Area of the second smaller circle.\n\nLet's calculate these areas using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Radii of the circles\nr_large = 5.5\nr_small1 = 2\nr_small2 = 3\n\n# Areas of the circles\narea_large = math.pi * r_large**2\narea_small1 = math.pi * r_small1**2\narea_small2 = math.pi * r_small2**2\n\n# Shaded area\nshaded_area = area_large - area_small1 - area_small2\n\nprint(shaded_area)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the area of the shaded region.",
    "The code execution result provides the numerical value of the shaded area, but the problem requires the answer to be expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\). Let's re-evaluate the problem and express the answer symbolically.\n\n1. **Re-evaluate the radii:**\n   - The radius of the larger circle is indeed \\(5.5\\), as calculated from the midpoint and the distance to the center of the smaller circle.\n\n2. **Symbolic calculation of areas:**\n   - Area of the larger circle: \\(\\pi \\times (5.5)^2 = 30.25\\pi\\).\n   - Area of the first smaller circle: \\(\\pi \\times (2)^2 = 4\\pi\\).\n   - Area of the second smaller circle: \\(\\pi \\times (3)^2 = 9\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Symbolic calculation of the shaded area:**\n   - Shaded area = \\(30.25\\pi - 4\\pi - 9\\pi = 17.25\\pi\\).\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region, expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\), is \\(17.25\\pi\\).\n\n<<<17.25\\pi>>>"
