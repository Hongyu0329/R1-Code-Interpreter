    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the volume of the cube to the volume of the square-based pyramid and solve for the height \\( h \\).\n\n1. **Volume of the Cube**: \n   The volume \\( V \\) of a cube with edge length \\( a \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3\n   \\]\n   For a cube with edge length 4 units:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cube}} = 4^3 = 64 \\text{ cubic units}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the Square-based Pyramid**:\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a square-based pyramid with base edge length \\( b \\) and height \\( h \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times b^2 \\times h\n   \\]\n   For a pyramid with base edge length 8 units:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 8^2 \\times h = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 64 \\times h = \\frac{64}{3} \\times h\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equating the Volumes**:\n   Since the volumes are equal:\n   \\[\n   64 = \\frac{64}{3} \\times h\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( h \\)**:\n   We can solve the equation for \\( h \\) by isolating \\( h \\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{64 \\times 3}{64} = 3\n   \\]\n\nThus, the height \\( h \\) of the pyramid is 3 units.\n\n<<<3>>>"
