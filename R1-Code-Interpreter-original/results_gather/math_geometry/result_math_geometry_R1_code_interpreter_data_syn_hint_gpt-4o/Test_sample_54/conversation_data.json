    "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the space inside the sphere but outside the cylinder. \n\n1. **Volume of the Sphere**: \n   The volume \\( V_s \\) of a sphere with radius \\( R \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V_s = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( R = 5 \\). So, the volume of the sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_s = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the Cylinder**:\n   The volume \\( V_c \\) of a right circular cylinder with base radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_c = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( r = 3 \\). The cylinder is inscribed in the sphere, so the diagonal of the cylinder (which is the diameter of the sphere) is 10 units. The diagonal of the cylinder can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the height \\( h \\) and the diameter of the base \\( 2r = 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   h^2 + (2r)^2 = (2R)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h^2 + 36 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h^2 = 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h = 8\n   \\]\n   So, the volume of the cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_c = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72 \\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Volume of the Space Inside the Sphere and Outside the Cylinder**:\n   The volume of the space inside the sphere and outside the cylinder is the difference between the volume of the sphere and the volume of the cylinder:\n   \\[\n   V = V_s - V_c = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi - 72 \\pi\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V = \\left(\\frac{500}{3} - 72\\right) \\pi\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V = \\left(\\frac{500}{3} - \\frac{216}{3}\\right) \\pi\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{284}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( W = \\frac{284}{3} \\).\n\n<<<\\frac{284}{3}>>>"
