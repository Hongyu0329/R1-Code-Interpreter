    "To find the total area of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid, we need to calculate the area of one triangular face and then multiply it by four.\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the triangular face:**\n   - The base of each triangular face is the side of the square base, which is 6 units.\n   - The lateral edge of the pyramid is 5 units, which acts as the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the height of the triangular face, half of the base, and the lateral edge.\n\n2. **Calculate the height of the triangular face:**\n   - The height of the triangular face can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The half of the base is 3 units (since the base is 6 units), and the lateral edge is 5 units.\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the height of the triangular face. Then, according to the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     h^2 + 3^2 = 5^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h^2 + 9 = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h^2 = 16\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h = 4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of one triangular face:**\n   - The area \\( A \\) of a triangle is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - For one triangular face:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ square units}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total area of the four triangular faces:**\n   - Since there are four identical triangular faces:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Area} = 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ square units}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total area of the four triangular faces is 48 square units.\n\n<<<48>>>"
