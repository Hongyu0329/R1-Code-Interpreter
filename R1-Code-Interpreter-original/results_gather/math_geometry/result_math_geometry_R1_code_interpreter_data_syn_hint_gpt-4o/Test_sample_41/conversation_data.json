    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the third circle that is tangent to the two given circles and one of their common external tangents.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( r_1 = 1 \\) as the radius of the circle centered at \\( A \\).\n- \\( r_2 = 4 \\) as the radius of the circle centered at \\( B \\).\n- \\( r_3 \\) as the radius of the third circle we need to find.\n\nThe centers of the two given circles are separated by a distance equal to the sum of their radii, since they are externally tangent. Therefore, the distance between the centers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\( r_1 + r_2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\).\n\nThe third circle is tangent to both circles and the external tangent line. This configuration suggests the use of Descartes' Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures (reciprocals of the radii) of four mutually tangent circles. The theorem states:\n\n\\[\n(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)^2 = 2(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k_i = \\frac{1}{r_i} \\) is the curvature of the \\( i \\)-th circle. For the line, the curvature is zero, so \\( k_4 = 0 \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( k_1 = \\frac{1}{1} = 1 \\)\n- \\( k_2 = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \\)\n- \\( k_3 = \\frac{1}{r_3} \\)\n\nSubstituting these into Descartes' Circle Theorem:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 0.25 + \\frac{1}{r_3})^2 = 2(1^2 + 0.25^2 + (\\frac{1}{r_3})^2)\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation for \\( r_3 \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nr3 = symbols('r3', positive=True)\n\n# Curvatures\nk1 = 1\nk2 = 0.25\nk3 = 1/r3\n\n# Descartes' Circle Theorem equation\nequation = (k1 + k2 + k3)**2 - 2*(k1**2 + k2**2 + k3**2)\n\n# Solve for r3\nsolution = solve(equation, r3)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe code will solve the equation and provide the value of \\( r_3 \\).",
    "The code execution result provided two solutions: \\( r_3 = 0.444444444444444 \\) and \\( r_3 = 4.00000000000000 \\). \n\nThe solution \\( r_3 = 4.00000000000000 \\) is not feasible because it would imply that the third circle is as large as the circle centered at \\( B \\), which contradicts the problem's configuration where the third circle is smaller and tangent to both given circles and the tangent line.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is \\( r_3 = 0.444444444444444 \\).\n\nThus, the radius of the third circle is approximately \\( 0.444 \\).\n\n<<<0.444>>>"
