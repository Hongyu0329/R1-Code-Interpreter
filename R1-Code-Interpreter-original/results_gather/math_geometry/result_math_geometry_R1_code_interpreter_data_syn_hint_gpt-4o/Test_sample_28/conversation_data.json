    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of reflection over the y-axis. When a point $(x, y)$ is reflected over the y-axis, its x-coordinate changes sign, while the y-coordinate remains the same. \n\nGiven that Point $A$ has coordinates $(x, 6)$, when it is reflected over the y-axis, it becomes Point $B$ with coordinates $(-x, 6)$. \n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$. \n\n- Coordinates of Point $A$: $(x, 6)$\n- Coordinates of Point $B$: $(-x, 6)$\n\nThe sum of the coordinates is:\n\\[ x + 6 + (-x) + 6 \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\\[ x - x + 6 + 6 = 0 + 12 = 12 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$ is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
