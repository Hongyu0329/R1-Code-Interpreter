    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the common chord of two overlapping circles. Each circle has a radius of 10 cm, and each circle passes through the center of the other.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: \n   - The centers of the two circles are 10 cm apart because each circle passes through the center of the other.\n   - The common chord is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the two circles and bisects it.\n\n2. **Using the Right Triangle**:\n   - Consider the right triangle formed by the radius of one circle, half of the common chord, and the line segment from the center of one circle to the midpoint of the chord.\n   - The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius of the circle, which is 10 cm.\n   - The base of this right triangle is half the distance between the centers of the two circles, which is 5 cm (since the full distance is 10 cm).\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be half the length of the common chord.\n   - According to the Pythagorean theorem: \n     \\[\n     x^2 + 5^2 = 10^2\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 25 = 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 75\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Full Length of the Chord**:\n   - The full length of the chord is twice \\( x \\), so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of the chord} = 2x = 2 \\times 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the length of the common chord is \\( 10\\sqrt{3} \\) cm.\n\n<<<10\\sqrt{3}>>>"
