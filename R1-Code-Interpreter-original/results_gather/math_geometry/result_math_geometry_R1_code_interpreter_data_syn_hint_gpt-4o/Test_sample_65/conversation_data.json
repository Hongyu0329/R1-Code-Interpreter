    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds given that the chocolate from a larger hemisphere-shaped bowl is evenly distributed among them.\n\n1. **Volume of the Larger Hemisphere:**\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a hemisphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   For the larger hemisphere, the radius \\( R \\) is 1 foot. So, the volume \\( V_L \\) is:\n   \\[\n   V_L = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of Each Smaller Hemisphere:**\n   Let the radius of each smaller hemisphere be \\( r_s \\). The volume of one smaller hemisphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_s = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r_s^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Volume of Smaller Hemispheres:**\n   Since the chocolate is evenly distributed among 27 smaller hemispheres, the total volume of the 27 smaller hemispheres is equal to the volume of the larger hemisphere:\n   \\[\n   27 \\times V_s = V_L\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   27 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r_s^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( r_s \\):**\n   We can cancel \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\pi\\) from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   27 r_s^3 = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_s^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_s = \\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right)^{1/3}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( r_s \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the radius of the smaller hemisphere molds\nr_s = (1/27)**(1/3)\nprint(r_s)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the radius of each smaller mold.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the radius of each smaller hemisphere mold is approximately 0.3333 feet. This result is consistent with the mathematical reasoning we performed earlier.\n\nTo summarize the solution:\n\n- We calculated the volume of the larger hemisphere with a radius of 1 foot.\n- We set up an equation to distribute this volume evenly among 27 smaller hemispheres.\n- Solving the equation, we found that the radius of each smaller hemisphere is \\((1/27)^{1/3}\\), which is approximately 0.3333 feet.\n\nTherefore, the radius of each of the smaller molds is approximately 0.3333 feet.\n\n<<<0.3333>>>"
