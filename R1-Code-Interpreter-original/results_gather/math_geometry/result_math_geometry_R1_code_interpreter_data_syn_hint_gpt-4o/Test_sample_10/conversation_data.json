    "To find the height of the cylinder, we can use the formula for the total surface area of a cylinder:\n\n\\[ SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh \\]\n\nGiven:\n- The radius \\( r = 2 \\) feet\n- The total surface area \\( SA = 12\\pi \\) square feet\n\nWe need to find the height \\( h \\).\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\n\\[ 12\\pi = 2\\pi (2)^2 + 2\\pi (2)h \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 12\\pi = 8\\pi + 4\\pi h \\]\n\nSubtract \\( 8\\pi \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 4\\pi = 4\\pi h \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( 4\\pi \\):\n\n\\[ h = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the height of the cylinder is 1 foot.\n\n<<<1>>>"
