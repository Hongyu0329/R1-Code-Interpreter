    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the region bounded by the arcs of circles. The arcs are part of circles with a radius of 4 units and a central angle of 60 degrees. The arcs intersect at points of tangency, forming a region that resembles a Reuleaux triangle.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: \n   - Each arc is a segment of a circle with a radius of 4 units and a central angle of 60 degrees.\n   - The region is formed by three such arcs intersecting at their endpoints.\n\n2. **Area of a Sector**:\n   - The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of sector} = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi \\times r^2\n     \\]\n   - For each arc, \\(\\theta = 60\\) degrees and \\(r = 4\\).\n\n3. **Area of the Equilateral Triangle**:\n   - The region is bounded by an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the radius of the circles, which is 4 units.\n   - The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times s^2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Region**:\n   - The area of the region is the area of the equilateral triangle plus three times the area of the sectors minus the area of the circle segments that are outside the triangle.\n\nLet's calculate these areas step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of One Sector\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one sector} = \\frac{60}{360} \\times \\pi \\times 4^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\pi \\times 16 = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle\n\\[\n\\text{Area of triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 4^2 = 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Region\nThe area of the region is the area of the equilateral triangle plus three times the area of the sectors minus the area of the circle segments that are outside the triangle. However, since the arcs form a Reuleaux triangle, the area of the circle segments outside the triangle is already accounted for in the sector calculation.\n\nThus, the area of the region is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of region} = 4\\sqrt{3} + 3 \\times \\frac{8\\pi}{3} - 4\\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3} + 8\\pi - 4\\sqrt{3} = 8\\pi\n\\]\n\nThe area can be expressed in the form \\(a\\sqrt{b} + c\\pi\\), where \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 8\\).\n\nFinally, the value of \\(a + b + c\\) is:\n\\[\na + b + c = 0 + 1 + 8 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
