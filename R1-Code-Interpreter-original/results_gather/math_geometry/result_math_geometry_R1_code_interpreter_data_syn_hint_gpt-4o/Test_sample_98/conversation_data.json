    "To find the total surface area of a hemisphere, we need to consider both the curved surface area and the base area of the hemisphere.\n\n1. **Base Area**: The area of the base of the hemisphere is given as \\(100\\pi\\).\n\n2. **Curved Surface Area**: The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is \\(2\\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the hemisphere.\n\n3. **Total Surface Area**: The total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of the curved surface area and the base area. Therefore, it is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Surface Area} = 2\\pi r^2 + \\pi r^2 = 3\\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\nGiven that the base area is \\(100\\pi\\), we can find the radius \\(r\\) using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\\[\n\\pi r^2 = 100\\pi\n\\]\nSolving for \\(r^2\\), we get:\n\\[\nr^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(r^2 = 100\\) into the total surface area formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Surface Area} = 3\\pi \\times 100 = 300\\pi\n\\]\n\nThus, the total surface area of the hemisphere is \\(300\\pi\\).\n\n<<<300\\pi>>>"
