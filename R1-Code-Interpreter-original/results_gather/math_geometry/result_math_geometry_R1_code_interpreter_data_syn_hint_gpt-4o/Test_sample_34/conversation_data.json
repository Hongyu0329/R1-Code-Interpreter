    "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone.\n\nGiven:\n- Diameter of the cone = 10 cm, so the radius \\( r = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) cm.\n- Height \\( h = 6 \\) cm.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (5)^2 (6) \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius = 5  # in cm\nheight = 6  # in cm\n\n# Volume of the cone\nvolume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius**2) * height\n\n# Expressing the volume in terms of pi\nvolume_in_terms_of_pi = (1/3) * (radius**2) * height\n\nprint(volume_in_terms_of_pi)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the volume in terms of \\(\\pi\\).",
    "The code execution result indicates that the volume of the cone in terms of \\(\\pi\\) is approximately 50. This is consistent with the calculation:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 5^2 \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 25 \\times 6 = \\frac{150}{3} = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cone in terms of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(50\\pi\\) cubic centimeters.\n\n<<<50\\pi>>>"
