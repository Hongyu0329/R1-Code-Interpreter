    "To find out how many cubic feet of snow Khali has to shovel, we need to calculate the volume of the snow on the sidewalk. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the snow on the sidewalk) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nIn this case:\n- The length of the sidewalk is 20 feet.\n- The width of the sidewalk is 2 feet.\n- The depth (or height) of the snow is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 20 \\times 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 20 \\times 2 \\times 0.5 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, Khali has to shovel 20 cubic feet of snow off the sidewalk.\n\n<<<20>>>"
