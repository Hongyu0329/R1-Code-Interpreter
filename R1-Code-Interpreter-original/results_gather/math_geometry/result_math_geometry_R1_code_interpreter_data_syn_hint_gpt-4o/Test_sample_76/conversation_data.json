    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of an equilateral triangle given the area of its inscribed circle.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have an equilateral triangle ABC.\n   - O is the center of the inscribed circle (incircle).\n   - The area of the circle is given as \\(4\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n\n2. **Finding the Radius of the Circle:**\n   - The area of a circle is given by the formula \\(\\pi r^2\\).\n   - We know \\(\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi\\).\n   - Solving for \\(r\\), we get \\(r^2 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(r = 2\\).\n\n3. **Relating the Radius to the Side of the Triangle:**\n   - For an equilateral triangle, the radius \\(r\\) of the incircle is related to the side length \\(s\\) by the formula:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n     \\]\n   - We have \\(r = 2\\), so:\n     \\[\n     2 = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(s\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Equilateral Triangle:**\n   - The area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\(s = 4\\sqrt{3}\\):\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (4\\sqrt{3})^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 48 = 12\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle ABC is \\(12\\sqrt{3}\\) square centimeters.\n\n<<<12\\sqrt{3}>>>"
