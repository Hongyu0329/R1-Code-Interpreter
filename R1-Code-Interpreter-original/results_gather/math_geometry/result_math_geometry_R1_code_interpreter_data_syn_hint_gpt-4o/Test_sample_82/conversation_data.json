    "To determine the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of a triangle with sides measuring 4 cm and 9 cm, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's denote the third side as \\( x \\). According to the triangle inequality theorem, we have the following conditions:\n\n1. \\( 4 + 9 > x \\)\n2. \\( 4 + x > 9 \\)\n3. \\( 9 + x > 4 \\)\n\nLet's solve these inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 4 + 9 > x \\) simplifies to \\( x < 13 \\).\n2. \\( 4 + x > 9 \\) simplifies to \\( x > 5 \\).\n3. \\( 9 + x > 4 \\) simplifies to \\( x > -5 \\), which is always true given \\( x > 5 \\).\n\nThe valid range for \\( x \\) is \\( 5 < x < 13 \\). Therefore, the greatest integer value for \\( x \\) is 12.\n\nThus, the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of this triangle is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
