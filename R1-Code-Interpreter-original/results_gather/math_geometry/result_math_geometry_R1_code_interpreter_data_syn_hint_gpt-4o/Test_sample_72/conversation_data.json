    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the arcs and the circles.\n\n1. **Arc Length Formula**: The length of an arc \\( L \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   L = r \\theta\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle and \\( \\theta \\) is the angle in radians.\n\n2. **Convert Angles to Radians**: \n   - A 45-degree angle is equivalent to \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians.\n   - A 36-degree angle is equivalent to \\( \\frac{36\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\) radians.\n\n3. **Arc Lengths**:\n   - For the smaller circle with radius \\( r_1 \\), the arc length is \\( r_1 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n   - For the larger circle with radius \\( r_2 \\), the arc length is \\( r_2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\).\n\n4. **Equating Arc Lengths**: Since the arc lengths are equal:\n   \\[\n   r_1 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = r_2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{5}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for the Ratio of Radii**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\pi/4} = \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Area Ratio**: The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the smaller circle to the larger circle is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle is \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
