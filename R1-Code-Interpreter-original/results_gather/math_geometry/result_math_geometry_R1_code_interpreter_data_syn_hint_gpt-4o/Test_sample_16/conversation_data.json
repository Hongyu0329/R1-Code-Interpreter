    "To find the length of the diagonal \\( DA \\) in the regular hexagon, we need to understand the properties of a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. \n\nGiven that the side length of the hexagon is 10 units, each of these equilateral triangles also has sides of length 10 units. The diagonal \\( DA \\) in the hexagon is actually twice the side length of the hexagon because it spans across two equilateral triangles.\n\nTherefore, the length of diagonal \\( DA \\) is \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) units.\n\nThus, the length of diagonal \\( DA \\) is 20 units.\n\n<<<20>>>"
