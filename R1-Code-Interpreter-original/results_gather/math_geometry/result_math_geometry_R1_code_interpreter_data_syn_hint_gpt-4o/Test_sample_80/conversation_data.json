    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longer side of the rectangle given that a circle with a radius of 4 cm is tangent to three sides of the rectangle, and the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle.\n\n1. **Calculate the Area of the Circle:**\n   The area of a circle is given by the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n   Here, the radius \\( r = 4 \\) cm.\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Area of the Rectangle:**\n   The area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle.\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{rectangle}} = 2 \\times 16\\pi = 32\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Dimensions of the Rectangle:**\n   Since the circle is tangent to three sides of the rectangle, one side of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) cm.\n\n4. **Find the Length of the Longer Side:**\n   Let the longer side of the rectangle be \\( L \\).\n   The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its sides:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times L = 32\\pi\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( L \\):\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{32\\pi}{8} = 4\\pi \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the length of the longer side of the rectangle is \\( 4\\pi \\) cm.\n\n<<<4\\pi>>>"
