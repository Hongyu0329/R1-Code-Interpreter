    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these equal sides are also equal.\n\nGiven that one of the angles opposite an equal side is \\(40^\\circ\\), the other angle opposite the other equal side is also \\(40^\\circ\\).\n\nThe sum of the angles in any triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\). Therefore, we can find the measure of the third angle, which is the largest angle in this isosceles triangle, by subtracting the sum of the two equal angles from \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Largest angle} = 180^\\circ - 40^\\circ - 40^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, the measure of the triangle's largest angle is \\(100^\\circ\\).\n\n<<<100>>>"
