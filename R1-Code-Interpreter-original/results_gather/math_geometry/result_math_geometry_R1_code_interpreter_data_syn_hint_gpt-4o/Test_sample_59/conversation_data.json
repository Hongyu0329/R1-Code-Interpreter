    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of an octagon inscribed in a square where the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. \n\n1. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   - The perimeter of the square is given as 108 cm.\n   - Since a square has four equal sides, the side length of the square is \\( \\frac{108}{4} = 27 \\) cm.\n\n2. **Understand the trisection of the square's sides:**\n   - Each side of the square is divided into three equal parts by the vertices of the octagon.\n   - Therefore, each segment is \\( \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\) cm long.\n\n3. **Visualize the octagon:**\n   - The octagon is formed by cutting off the corners of the square.\n   - Each corner cut is a right-angled isosceles triangle with legs of 9 cm.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the square:**\n   - The area of the square is \\( 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\) square centimeters.\n\n5. **Calculate the area of one corner triangle:**\n   - The area of one right-angled isosceles triangle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9 \\times 9 = 40.5 \\) square centimeters.\n\n6. **Calculate the total area of the four corner triangles:**\n   - Since there are four such triangles, the total area removed is \\( 4 \\times 40.5 = 162 \\) square centimeters.\n\n7. **Calculate the area of the octagon:**\n   - The area of the octagon is the area of the square minus the area of the four triangles: \\( 729 - 162 = 567 \\) square centimeters.\n\nThus, the area of the octagon is 567 square centimeters.\n\n<<<567>>>"
