    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere in which the rectangular box \\( P \\) is inscribed. We are given:\n\n1. The surface area of the box \\( P \\) is 384.\n2. The sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the box as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\n\n1. The surface area of the box: \n   \\[\n   2(ab + bc + ca) = 384\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   ab + bc + ca = 192\n   \\]\n\n2. The sum of the lengths of the edges:\n   \\[\n   4(a + b + c) = 112\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = 28\n   \\]\n\nSince the box is inscribed in the sphere, the diagonal of the box is equal to the diameter of the sphere. The diagonal \\( d \\) of the box is given by:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\n\\]\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is half of the diagonal:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\), we can use the identity:\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n28^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2 \\times 192\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) and then find \\( r \\).\n\n```python\n# Given values\nsum_of_edges = 28\nsum_of_products = 192\n\n# Calculate a^2 + b^2 + c^2\na2_b2_c2 = sum_of_edges**2 - 2 * sum_of_products\n\n# Calculate the radius r\nr = (a2_b2_c2**0.5) / 2\n\nprint(r)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the value of \\( r \\).",
    "The code execution result indicates that the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is 10.0. This result is consistent with the calculations based on the given conditions of the problem. \n\nTo summarize the solution:\n\n1. We used the given conditions to set up the equations for the surface area and the sum of the edges of the rectangular box.\n2. We derived the expression for the diagonal of the box, which is equal to the diameter of the sphere.\n3. We calculated the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere as half of the diagonal.\n\nThe calculations were verified through the code execution, and the result is consistent with the problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is:\n\n<<<10.0>>>"
