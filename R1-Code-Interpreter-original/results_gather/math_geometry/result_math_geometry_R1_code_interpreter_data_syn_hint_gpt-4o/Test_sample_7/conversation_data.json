    "To find the volume of one piece of the pizza, we first need to calculate the total volume of the pizza and then divide it by the number of pieces.\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the entire pizza:**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height (or thickness in this case).\n\n   - The diameter of the pizza is 12 inches, so the radius \\( r \\) is half of that:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - The thickness \\( h \\) of the pizza is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inch.\n\n   Substituting these values into the volume formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi (6)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of one piece:**\n\n   Since the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, the volume of one piece is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of one piece} = \\frac{V}{12}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nradius = 6  # inches\nthickness = 1/3  # inches\nnumber_of_pieces = 12\n\n# Calculate the volume of the entire pizza\ntotal_volume = math.pi * (radius ** 2) * thickness\n\n# Calculate the volume of one piece\nvolume_of_one_piece = total_volume / number_of_pieces\n\nprint(volume_of_one_piece)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the volume of one piece in terms of \\(\\pi\\). Let's proceed with the calculation.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the volume of one piece of the pizza is approximately \\(3.141592653589793\\) cubic inches. However, the task requires expressing the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nLet's revisit the calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the entire pizza:**\n\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi \\times (6)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\pi \\times 36 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 12\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of one piece:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of one piece} = \\frac{12\\pi}{12} = \\pi\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of one piece of the pizza is \\(\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
