    "To find the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\), we need to use the formula for the inradius \\(r\\) of a triangle, which is given by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{A}{s}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the area of the triangle and \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s\\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{5 + 6 + 7}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area \\(A\\) of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 6\\), and \\(c = 7\\).\n\nLet's compute the area \\(A\\) and then the inradius \\(r\\).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Side lengths\na = 5\nb = 6\nc = 7\n\n# Semi-perimeter\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n# Area using Heron's formula\nA = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n\n# Inradius\nr = A / s\n\nprint(r)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of the inradius \\(r\\).",
    "The code execution result provided the inradius of the inscribed circle in triangle \\(ABC\\) as approximately 1.632993161855452. This result is consistent with the calculations based on the given side lengths of the triangle.\n\nTo express the inradius in simplest radical form, we need to analyze the result further. The decimal value 1.632993161855452 is equivalent to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}>>>"
