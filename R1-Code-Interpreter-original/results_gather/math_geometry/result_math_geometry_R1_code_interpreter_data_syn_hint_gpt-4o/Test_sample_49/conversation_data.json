    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of rectangle \\(ABCD\\). We are given that angle \\(C\\) is trisected by \\(\\overline{CF}\\) and \\(\\overline{CE}\\), where \\(E\\) is on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and \\(F\\) is on \\(\\overline{AD}\\). We also know that \\(BE = 6\\) and \\(AF = 2\\).\n\nLet's denote the length of \\(AB\\) as \\(x\\) and the length of \\(AD\\) as \\(y\\). Since \\(ABCD\\) is a rectangle, \\(AB = CD = x\\) and \\(AD = BC = y\\).\n\n1. **Trisection of Angle \\(C\\):**\n   - Since \\(\\angle C = 90^\\circ\\), each trisected angle is \\(30^\\circ\\).\n   - \\(\\angle DCF = 30^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle ECF = 60^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Using Trigonometry:**\n   - For \\(\\triangle ADF\\), \\(\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{AF}{AD} = \\frac{2}{y}\\).\n   - For \\(\\triangle CBE\\), \\(\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\frac{BE}{BC} = \\frac{6}{y}\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(y\\):**\n   - From \\(\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), we have \\(\\frac{2}{y} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), so \\(y = 2\\sqrt{3}\\).\n   - From \\(\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}\\), we have \\(\\frac{6}{y} = \\sqrt{3}\\), so \\(y = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n4. **Finding \\(x\\):**\n   - Since \\(BE = 6\\), \\(x = BE + AE = 6 + (x - 6) = x\\).\n\n5. **Area of Rectangle \\(ABCD\\):**\n   - The area is \\(x \\times y\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the area using the values we have found.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nBE = 6\nAF = 2\n\n# Calculate y using tan(30) = 1/sqrt(3)\ny = 2 * math.sqrt(3)\n\n# Calculate x using the fact that BE = 6\nx = BE + 6\n\n# Calculate the area of the rectangle\narea = x * y\n\nprint(area)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the area of rectangle \\(ABCD\\).",
