    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a trapezoid and the arithmetic sequence of its angles.\n\n1. **Properties of a Trapezoid**: A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Arithmetic Sequence**: In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the angles of the trapezoid as \\(a\\), \\(a+d\\), \\(a+2d\\), and \\(a+3d\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n3. **Given Information**: The largest angle is \\(120^\\circ\\). Therefore, one of the angles \\(a\\), \\(a+d\\), \\(a+2d\\), or \\(a+3d\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Equation Setup**: The sum of the angles is:\n   \\[\n   a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) = 360^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   4a + 6d = 360^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2a + 3d = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Smallest Angle**: We need to determine which angle is the largest and then find the smallest angle. Let's assume \\(a+3d = 120^\\circ\\) (since it's the largest angle).\n\n6. **Solving the Equations**:\n   - From \\(a+3d = 120^\\circ\\), we can express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(d\\):\n     \\[\n     a = 120^\\circ - 3d\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(a = 120^\\circ - 3d\\) into \\(2a + 3d = 180^\\circ\\):\n     \\[\n     2(120^\\circ - 3d) + 3d = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     240^\\circ - 6d + 3d = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     240^\\circ - 3d = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3d = 60^\\circ\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     d = 20^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the Smallest Angle**:\n   - Substitute \\(d = 20^\\circ\\) back into \\(a = 120^\\circ - 3d\\):\n     \\[\n     a = 120^\\circ - 3(20^\\circ) = 120^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n     \\]\n\nThus, the smallest angle is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n<<<60>>>"
