    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region within the regular hexagon. The hexagon has a side length of 10 cm.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the entire hexagon:**\n   A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The area of one equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n   \\]\n   For the hexagon, the total area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of hexagon} = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( s = 10 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of hexagon} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 10^2 = 150\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the shaded region:**\n   The shaded region is a quadrilateral formed by connecting the midpoints of four sides of the hexagon. This quadrilateral is a rhombus.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the rhombus:**\n   The rhombus is formed by two equilateral triangles (each with side length 10 cm) sharing a common side. The area of the rhombus is twice the area of one of these triangles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of rhombus} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 10^2 = 50\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region is \\( 50\\sqrt{3} \\) square centimeters.\n\n<<<50\\sqrt{3}>>>"
