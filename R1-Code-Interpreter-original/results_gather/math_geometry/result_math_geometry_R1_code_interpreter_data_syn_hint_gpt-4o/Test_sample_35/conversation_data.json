    "To find the area of the interior region formed by the lines \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), and the \\( y \\)-axis, we need to determine the points of intersection of these lines and the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n1. **Find the intersection of the lines with the \\( y \\)-axis:**\n   - For \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\) to find the \\( y \\)-intercept: \\( y = 2(0) - 4 = -4 \\). So, the point is \\( (0, -4) \\).\n   - For \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\) to find the \\( y \\)-intercept: \\( y = -3(0) + 16 = 16 \\). So, the point is \\( (0, 16) \\).\n\n2. **Find the intersection of the two lines:**\n   - Set \\( 2x - 4 = -3x + 16 \\) to find the intersection point.\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     2x - 4 = -3x + 16 \\\\\n     2x + 3x = 16 + 4 \\\\\n     5x = 20 \\\\\n     x = 4\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into one of the equations to find \\( y \\):\n     \\[\n     y = 2(4) - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4\n     \\]\n   - So, the intersection point is \\( (4, 4) \\).\n\n3. **Determine the vertices of the triangle:**\n   - The vertices are \\( (0, -4) \\), \\( (0, 16) \\), and \\( (4, 4) \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n   - Use the formula for the area of a triangle given vertices \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), \\((x_3, y_3)\\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the vertices into the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(16-4) + 0(4+4) + 4(-4-16) \\right|\n     \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Vertices of the triangle\nx1, y1 = 0, -4\nx2, y2 = 0, 16\nx3, y3 = 4, 4\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula\narea = 0.5 * abs(x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2))\nprint(area)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the area of the triangle.",
    "The code execution result shows that the area of the triangle is 40.0 square units. This result is consistent with the calculations based on the vertices of the triangle formed by the lines and the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\nThe vertices of the triangle are:\n- \\( (0, -4) \\) from the line \\( y = 2x - 4 \\) intersecting the \\( y \\)-axis.\n- \\( (0, 16) \\) from the line \\( y = -3x + 16 \\) intersecting the \\( y \\)-axis.\n- \\( (4, 4) \\) from the intersection of the two lines.\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle with these vertices, the calculation was performed correctly, and the area was found to be 40.0 square units.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<40.0>>>"
