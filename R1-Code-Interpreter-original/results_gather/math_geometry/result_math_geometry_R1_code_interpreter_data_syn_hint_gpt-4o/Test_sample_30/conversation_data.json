    "To find the area of a triangle given its vertices in a Cartesian coordinate plane, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.\n\nGiven the vertices \\((5, -2)\\), \\((10, 5)\\), and \\((5, 5)\\), we can substitute these into the formula:\n\n- \\(x_1 = 5\\), \\(y_1 = -2\\)\n- \\(x_2 = 10\\), \\(y_2 = 5\\)\n- \\(x_3 = 5\\), \\(y_3 = 5\\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 5(5-5) + 10(5+2) + 5(-2-5) \\right|\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nx1, y1 = 5, -2\nx2, y2 = 10, 5\nx3, y3 = 5, 5\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula\narea = 0.5 * abs(x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2))\n\n# Print the area rounded to the nearest tenth\nprint(round(area, 1))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the area of the triangle.",
    "The code execution result shows that the area of the triangle is 17.5 square units. This result is obtained by correctly applying the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices in a Cartesian coordinate plane.\n\nThe formula used is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given vertices \\((5, -2)\\), \\((10, 5)\\), and \\((5, 5)\\) into the formula, the calculation was performed as follows:\n\n- \\(x_1 = 5\\), \\(y_1 = -2\\)\n- \\(x_2 = 10\\), \\(y_2 = 5\\)\n- \\(x_3 = 5\\), \\(y_3 = 5\\)\n\nThe calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 5(5-5) + 10(5+2) + 5(-2-5) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 70 - 35 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 35 = 17.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the triangle is 17.5 square units.\n\n<<<17.5>>>"
