    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\( x \\) first, and then find the lengths of the sides of the triangle to identify the longest side.\n\n1. **Set up the equation for the perimeter:**\n\n   The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Given that the perimeter is 36, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   7 + (x + 4) + (2x + 1) = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   7 + x + 4 + 2x + 1 = 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x + 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   Subtract 12 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x = 24\n   \\]\n   Divide by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the lengths of the sides:**\n\n   - First side: \\( 7 \\)\n   - Second side: \\( x + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 \\)\n   - Third side: \\( 2x + 1 = 2(8) + 1 = 17 \\)\n\n4. **Identify the longest side:**\n\n   The lengths of the sides are 7, 12, and 17. The longest side is 17.\n\nThus, the length of the longest side of the triangle is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
