    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a triangular prism and then find their sum.\n\n1. **Vertices**: A triangular prism has two triangular bases. Each triangle has 3 vertices, and since there are two triangles, we have \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) vertices.\n\n2. **Edges**: Each triangular base has 3 edges. Additionally, there are 3 edges connecting the corresponding vertices of the two triangles. Therefore, the total number of edges is \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\n3. **Faces**: A triangular prism has 2 triangular faces and 3 rectangular lateral faces. Thus, the total number of faces is \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\nNow, we sum the number of faces, edges, and vertices:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\text{Vertices} + \\text{Edges} + \\text{Faces} = 6 + 9 + 5\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of vertices, edges, and faces\nvertices = 6\nedges = 9\nfaces = 5\n\n# Sum of vertices, edges, and faces\ntotal_sum = vertices + edges + faces\nprint(total_sum)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the sum of the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a triangular prism is indeed 20. \n\nTo summarize:\n\n- A triangular prism has 6 vertices.\n- It has 9 edges.\n- It has 5 faces.\n\nThe sum of these is \\(6 + 9 + 5 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
