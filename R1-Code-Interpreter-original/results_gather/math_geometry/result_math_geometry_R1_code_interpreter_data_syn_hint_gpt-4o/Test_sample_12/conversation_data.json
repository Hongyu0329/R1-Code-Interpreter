    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of a sphere that is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surfaces of a truncated cone. The truncated cone has two horizontal bases with radii \\( R = 18 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\).\n\nThe sphere is inscribed in the truncated cone, meaning it touches all three surfaces. The key to solving this problem is to use the geometry of the truncated cone and the properties of the inscribed sphere.\n\n1. **Geometry of the Truncated Cone**: \n   - The truncated cone has two parallel circular bases with radii \\( R \\) and \\( r \\).\n   - The height of the truncated cone is not given, but it is not needed directly to find the radius of the sphere.\n\n2. **Properties of the Inscribed Sphere**:\n   - The sphere is tangent to the top and bottom bases and the lateral surface of the truncated cone.\n   - The center of the sphere lies on the axis of the cone.\n\n3. **Mathematical Approach**:\n   - The radius of the sphere \\( \\rho \\) can be found using the formula for the radius of a sphere inscribed in a truncated cone:\n     \\[\n     \\rho = \\frac{R \\cdot r}{R + r}\n     \\]\n   - This formula is derived from the geometry of the cone and the properties of tangency.\n\nLet's calculate the radius of the sphere using the given radii \\( R = 18 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\).\n\n```python\n# Given radii of the truncated cone\nR = 18\nr = 2\n\n# Calculate the radius of the inscribed sphere\nrho = (R * r) / (R + r)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(rho)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the radius of the sphere.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the radius of the sphere is 1.8, which is consistent with the formula used for calculating the radius of a sphere inscribed in a truncated cone. The formula \\(\\rho = \\frac{R \\cdot r}{R + r}\\) is appropriate for this geometric configuration, where \\(R\\) and \\(r\\) are the radii of the two bases of the truncated cone.\n\nGiven the problem's constraints and the geometry involved, the calculation seems correct. The sphere is tangent to both the top and bottom bases and the lateral surface, and the formula used accounts for these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the sphere that is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surfaces of the truncated cone is:\n\n<<<1.8>>>"
