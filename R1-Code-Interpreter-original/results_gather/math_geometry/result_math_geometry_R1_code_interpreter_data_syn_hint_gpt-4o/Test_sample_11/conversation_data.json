    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a right triangle and the trigonometric functions involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Triangle**: In a right triangle, one of the angles is 90 degrees. The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, if one angle is 90 degrees, the sum of the other two angles must be 90 degrees.\n\n2. **Given Information**:\n   - \\(\\sin D = \\frac{5}{13}\\)\n   - \\(\\sin E = 1\\)\n\n3. **Analyzing \\(\\sin E = 1\\)**: \n   - The sine of an angle is 1 only when the angle is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle \\(E\\) is the right angle in triangle \\(DEF\\).\n\n4. **Finding \\(\\sin F\\)**:\n   - Since \\(E\\) is 90 degrees, angles \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) must add up to 90 degrees because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\n   - Therefore, \\(F = 90^\\circ - D\\).\n\n5. **Using the Complementary Angle Identity**:\n   - The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle: \\(\\sin F = \\cos D\\).\n   - We know \\(\\sin D = \\frac{5}{13}\\). Using the Pythagorean identity, \\(\\cos D = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 D}\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\(\\cos D\\) and hence \\(\\sin F\\).\n\n\\[\n\\cos D = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{25}{169}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{144}{169}} = \\frac{12}{13}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\sin F = \\cos D = \\frac{12}{13}\\).\n\nThus, the value of \\(\\sin F\\) is \\(\\frac{12}{13}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{12}{13}>>>"
