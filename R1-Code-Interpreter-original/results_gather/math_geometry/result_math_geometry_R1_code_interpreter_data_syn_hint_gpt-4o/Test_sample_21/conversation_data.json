    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of the pattern. The pattern consists of semicircles with a diameter of 2 inches.\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:**\n   - Each semicircle has a diameter of 2 inches, which means the radius is 1 inch.\n   - The pattern is repeated along a 1-foot (12 inches) length.\n\n2. **Calculating the Area of One Semicircle:**\n   - The area of a full circle is given by \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - The area of a semicircle is half of that: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - For a semicircle with radius 1 inch, the area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Number of Semicircles in 1 Foot:**\n   - Since each semicircle has a diameter of 2 inches, we can fit \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) semicircles in 12 inches.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Area of Semicircles:**\n   - The total area of the semicircles in 1 foot is \\( 6 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 3\\pi \\).\n\n5. **Shaded Region:**\n   - The shaded region is the area covered by the semicircles, as they are arranged in a way that they form a continuous pattern without gaps.\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of this pattern is \\( 3\\pi \\) square inches.\n\n<<<3\\pi>>>"
