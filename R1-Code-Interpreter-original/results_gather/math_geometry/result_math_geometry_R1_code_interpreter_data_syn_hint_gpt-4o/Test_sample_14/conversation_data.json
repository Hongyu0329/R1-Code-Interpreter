    "To find the total volume of the snowballs used to make the snowman, we need to calculate the volume of each spherical snowball and then sum them up. The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nKadin uses three snowballs with radii 2 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches. We will calculate the volume for each and then add them together.\n\n1. **Volume of the first snowball (radius = 2 inches):**\n\n   \\[ V_1 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (2)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 8 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the second snowball (radius = 3 inches):**\n\n   \\[ V_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 27 = 36 \\pi \\]\n\n3. **Volume of the third snowball (radius = 5 inches):**\n\n   \\[ V_3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 125 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi \\]\n\nNow, we sum the volumes of the three snowballs:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi + 36 \\pi + \\frac{500}{3} \\pi \\]\n\nTo add these, we need a common denominator:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi + \\frac{108}{3} \\pi + \\frac{500}{3} \\pi = \\frac{32 + 108 + 500}{3} \\pi = \\frac{640}{3} \\pi \\]\n\nThus, the total volume of snow used is \\(\\frac{640}{3} \\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\n<<<\\frac{640}{3} \\pi>>>"
