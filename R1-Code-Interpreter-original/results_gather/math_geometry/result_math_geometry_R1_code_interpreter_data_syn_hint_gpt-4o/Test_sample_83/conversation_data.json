    "To compute \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ\\), we can use the periodic property of the tangent function. The tangent function has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\), meaning that \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\tan(\\theta + 180^\\circ \\times k)\\) for any integer \\(k\\).\n\nFirst, we need to find an equivalent angle for \\(3825^\\circ\\) within the range of \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(180^\\circ\\). We can do this by finding the remainder of \\(3825\\) when divided by \\(180\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the equivalent angle within the range of 0 to 180 degrees\nangle = 3825 % 180\nprint(angle)\n```\n\nOnce we have the equivalent angle, we can directly compute the tangent of that angle to find \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ\\).",
    "The code execution result shows that the equivalent angle for \\(3825^\\circ\\) is \\(45^\\circ\\). This means that \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ = \\tan 45^\\circ\\).\n\nThe tangent of \\(45^\\circ\\) is a well-known trigonometric value:\n\n\\[\n\\tan 45^\\circ = 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ\\) is 1.\n\n<<<'1'>>>"
