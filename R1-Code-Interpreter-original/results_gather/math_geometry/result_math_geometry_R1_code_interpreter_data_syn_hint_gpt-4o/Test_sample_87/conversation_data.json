    "To find the ratio of the areas of the two triangles, we first need to determine the area of each triangle. Both triangles are right triangles, as their side lengths satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nFor triangle \\(ABC\\) with sides 5, 12, and 13:\n- The area of a right triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n- Here, the base and height can be taken as 5 and 12 (the two shorter sides).\n- So, the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 12 = 30\\).\n\nFor triangle \\(DEF\\) with sides 8, 15, and 17:\n- Similarly, the base and height can be taken as 8 and 15.\n- So, the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 15 = 60\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) to the area of triangle \\(DEF\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Area of } ABC}{\\text{Area of } DEF} = \\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) to the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n<<<\\frac{1}{2}>>>"
