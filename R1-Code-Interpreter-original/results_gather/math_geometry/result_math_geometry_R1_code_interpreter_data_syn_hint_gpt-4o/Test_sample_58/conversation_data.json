    "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar triangles. Similar triangles have corresponding sides that are proportional.\n\nFirst, let's identify the sides of the first triangle. We know one side is 21 inches, and the hypotenuse is 29 inches. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other side:\n\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs of the triangle, and \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse. We have:\n\n\\[ 21^2 + b^2 = 29^2 \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ 441 + b^2 = 841 \\]\n\\[ b^2 = 841 - 441 \\]\n\\[ b^2 = 400 \\]\n\\[ b = \\sqrt{400} \\]\n\\[ b = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the sides of the first triangle are 21 inches, 20 inches, and 29 inches.\n\nNow, for the second triangle, which is similar to the first, the hypotenuse is 87 inches. The ratio of the hypotenuses of the two triangles gives us the scale factor:\n\n\\[ \\text{Scale factor} = \\frac{87}{29} \\]\n\nTo find the shortest side of the second triangle, we multiply the shortest side of the first triangle by the scale factor. The shortest side of the first triangle is 20 inches.\n\nLet's calculate the shortest side of the second triangle:\n\n\\[ \\text{Shortest side of second triangle} = 20 \\times \\frac{87}{29} \\]\n\nWe can calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the shortest side of the second triangle\nscale_factor = 87 / 29\nshortest_side_first_triangle = 20\nshortest_side_second_triangle = shortest_side_first_triangle * scale_factor\nprint(shortest_side_second_triangle)\n```",
    "The code execution result of 60.0 is correct. The calculation was performed to find the shortest side of the second triangle, which is similar to the first triangle. The scale factor was determined by the ratio of the hypotenuses, and this factor was applied to the shortest side of the first triangle to find the corresponding side in the second triangle.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle is 60.0 inches.\n\n<<<60.0>>>"
