    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the volume of a cylinder changes when its dimensions are altered. The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nInitially, let's denote the original radius as \\( r \\) and the original height as \\( h \\). The original volume \\( V_{\\text{original}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{original}} = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nNow, according to the problem, the height of the cylinder is doubled, and the radius is increased by 200%. Increasing the radius by 200% means the new radius \\( r_{\\text{new}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{new}} = r + 2r = 3r \\]\n\nThe new height \\( h_{\\text{new}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ h_{\\text{new}} = 2h \\]\n\nThe new volume \\( V_{\\text{new}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{new}})^2 h_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (3r)^2 (2h) \\]\n\nLet's calculate the factor \\( X \\) by which the volume is multiplied:\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{V_{\\text{new}}}{V_{\\text{original}}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( V_{\\text{new}} \\) and \\( V_{\\text{original}} \\):\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{\\pi (3r)^2 (2h)}{\\pi r^2 h} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression will give us the value of \\( X \\).\n\nLet's perform the calculation:\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot 9r^2 \\cdot 2h}{\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot h} \\]\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{18\\pi r^2 h}{\\pi r^2 h} \\]\n\n\\[ X = 18 \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cylinder is multiplied by a factor of 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
