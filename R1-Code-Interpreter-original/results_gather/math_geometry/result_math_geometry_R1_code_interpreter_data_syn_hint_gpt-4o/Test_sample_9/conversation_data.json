    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the square and then calculate its area.\n\n1. **Understanding the Arrangement**: \n   - There are four circles, each with a radius of 5 inches.\n   - The circles are arranged such that they touch each other and the sides of the square.\n\n2. **Determining the Side Length of the Square**:\n   - The centers of the circles form a smaller square inside the larger square.\n   - The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is equal to the diameter of a circle, which is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) inches.\n   - Therefore, the side length of the smaller square formed by the centers of the circles is 10 inches.\n\n3. **Calculating the Side Length of the Larger Square**:\n   - The side length of the larger square is equal to the side length of the smaller square plus twice the radius of a circle (since the circles touch the sides of the square).\n   - Thus, the side length of the larger square is \\(10 + 5 + 5 = 20\\) inches.\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Square**:\n   - The area of the square is given by the formula: \\(\\text{Area} = \\text{side length}^2\\).\n   - Therefore, the area of the square is \\(20^2 = 400\\) square inches.\n\nThus, the area of the square is 400 square inches.\n\n<<<400>>>"
