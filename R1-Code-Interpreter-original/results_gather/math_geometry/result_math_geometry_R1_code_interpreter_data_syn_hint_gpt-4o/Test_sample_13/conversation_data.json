    "To determine the possible whole number values of \\( n \\) that allow the three sticks to form a triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven the sides are 5 cm, 9 cm, and \\( n \\) cm, the inequalities are:\n\n1. \\( 5 + 9 > n \\)\n2. \\( 5 + n > 9 \\)\n3. \\( 9 + n > 5 \\)\n\nLet's solve these inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 5 + 9 > n \\) simplifies to \\( 14 > n \\) or \\( n < 14 \\).\n2. \\( 5 + n > 9 \\) simplifies to \\( n > 4 \\).\n3. \\( 9 + n > 5 \\) simplifies to \\( n > -4 \\), which is always true for positive \\( n \\).\n\nCombining the inequalities \\( n < 14 \\) and \\( n > 4 \\), we get \\( 4 < n < 14 \\).\n\nThe possible whole number values for \\( n \\) are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of these possible values of \\( n \\).\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sum of possible whole number values of n\npossible_values = range(5, 14)\nsum_of_values = sum(possible_values)\nprint(sum_of_values)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we find the sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\).\n\n<<<answer>>>",
    "The code execution result confirms that the sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\) is 81. This was calculated by summing the integers from 5 to 13, inclusive, which are the possible values of \\( n \\) that satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<81>>>"
