    "To solve this problem, we need to use the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere.\n\n1. **Volume of a sphere**: The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   We are given that the volume is \\( 36\\pi \\). So, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = 36\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for the radius \\( r \\)**: We can solve for \\( r^3 \\) by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\) and then multiplying by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n   \\[\n   r^3 = \\frac{3 \\times 36}{4} = 27\n   \\]\n   Taking the cube root of both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   r = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Surface area of a sphere**: The formula for the surface area \\( A \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is:\n   \\[\n   A = 4 \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( r = 3 \\) into the formula gives:\n   \\[\n   A = 4 \\pi (3)^2 = 4 \\pi \\times 9 = 36\\pi\n   \\]\n\nThus, the surface area of the sphere is \\( 36\\pi \\) square inches.\n\n<<<36\\pi>>>"
