    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the WIN sector of the circular spinner. The probability of winning on one spin is given as \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\). This probability represents the fraction of the total area of the circle that is the WIN sector.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total area of the circle. The formula for the area of a circle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. Given that the radius is 10 cm, the total area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Area} = \\pi \\times 10^2 = 100\\pi \\, \\text{sq cm} \\]\n\nNext, we use the probability of winning to find the area of the WIN sector. The probability \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) means that the WIN sector occupies \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the total area of the circle. Therefore, the area of the WIN sector is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of WIN sector} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100\\pi = 40\\pi \\, \\text{sq cm} \\]\n\nThus, the area of the WIN sector is \\(40\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n\n<<<40\\pi>>>"
