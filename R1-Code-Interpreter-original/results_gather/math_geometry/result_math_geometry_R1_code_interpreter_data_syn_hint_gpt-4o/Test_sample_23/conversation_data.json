    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of triangle \\( \\triangle CEF \\) given that \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are midpoints of sides \\( \\overline{AC} \\) and \\( \\overline{AB} \\) respectively, and the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is 24 square units.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1. **Midpoint Theorem**: In a triangle, the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is parallel to the third side and half its length. Therefore, \\( \\overline{EF} \\) is parallel to \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and \\( EF = \\frac{1}{2} BC \\).\n\n2. **Area Ratio**: Since \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are midpoints, \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is similar to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with a similarity ratio of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). The area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of the similarity ratio.\n\n3. **Calculate Area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\)**: The area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\) times the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle CEF = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is 6 square units.\n\n<<<6>>>"
