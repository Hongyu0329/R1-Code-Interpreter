    "\nassistant > To find the total volume of snow used to make the snowman, we need to calculate the volume of each spherical snowball and then sum them up. The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the volume for each snowball:\n\n1. **Snowball with radius 2 inches:**\n   \\[\n   V_1 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (2)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 8 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Snowball with radius 3 inches:**\n   \\[\n   V_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 27 = 36 \\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Snowball with radius 5 inches:**\n   \\[\n   V_3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 125 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the volumes of the three snowballs to find the total volume:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi + 36 \\pi + \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this total volume.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import pi, Rational\n\n# Volumes of the snowballs\nV1 = Rational(32, 3) * pi\nV2 = 36 * pi\nV3 = Rational(500, 3) * pi\n\n# Total volume\nV_total = V1 + V2 + V3\nV_total\nassistant > The total volume of snow used to make the snowman is \\(\\frac{640}{3} \\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<640/3*pi>>>."
