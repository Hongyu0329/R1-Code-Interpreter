    "\nassistant > To find the length of the shortest side of the second triangle, we can use the properties of similar triangles. Similar triangles have corresponding sides in proportion.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the first triangle as follows:\n- One side (shortest side) = \\( a \\)\n- The other side = 21 inches\n- Hypotenuse = 29 inches\n\nFor the second triangle, the hypotenuse is 87 inches. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the hypotenuses of the two triangles is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the shortest side \\( a \\) of the first triangle using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ a^2 + 21^2 = 29^2 \\]\n\nOnce we have \\( a \\), we can find the shortest side of the second triangle using the ratio of the hypotenuses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_{\\text{second}}}{a} = \\frac{87}{29} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the length of the shortest side of the second triangle.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Given values for the first triangle\nside_1 = 21\nhypotenuse_1 = 29\n\n# Calculate the shortest side of the first triangle using the Pythagorean theorem\nshortest_side_1 = math.sqrt(hypotenuse_1**2 - side_1**2)\n\n# Given hypotenuse of the second triangle\nhypotenuse_2 = 87\n\n# Calculate the shortest side of the second triangle using the ratio of hypotenuses\nshortest_side_2 = (shortest_side_1 / hypotenuse_1) * hypotenuse_2\nshortest_side_2\nassistant > The length of the shortest side of the second triangle is approximately \\( 60 \\) inches. Therefore, the answer is <<<60.0>>>."
