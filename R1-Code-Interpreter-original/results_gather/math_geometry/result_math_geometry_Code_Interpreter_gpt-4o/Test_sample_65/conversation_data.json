    "\nassistant > To find the radius of each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds, we need to use the formula for the volume of a hemisphere. The volume \\( V \\) of a hemisphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of the large hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\nThis volume is then evenly distributed among 27 smaller hemisphere-shaped molds. Let the radius of each smaller mold be \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\). The volume of each smaller hemisphere is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r_{\\text{small}}^3\n\\]\n\nSince the total volume of the chocolate is distributed among 27 smaller molds, we have:\n\n\\[\n27 \\times V_{\\text{small}} = V_{\\text{large}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the volumes, we get:\n\n\\[\n27 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r_{\\text{small}}^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\pi\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n27 \\times r_{\\text{small}}^3 = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{small}}^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{small}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the radius of each smaller mold\nr_small = (1/27)**(1/3)\nr_small\nassistant > The radius of each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds is approximately \\(0.333\\) feet. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.333>>>"
