    "\nassistant > To find the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\), we need to use the formula for the inradius \\(r\\) of a triangle, which is given by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{A}{s}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the area of the triangle and \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s\\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{5 + 6 + 7}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area \\(A\\) of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 6\\), and \\(c = 7\\).\n\nLet's calculate the area \\(A\\) and then the inradius \\(r\\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Side lengths\na = 5\nb = 6\nc = 7\n\n# Semi-perimeter\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n# Area using Heron's formula\nA = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n\n# Inradius\nr = A / s\nr\nassistant > The radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).
