    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use the Power of a Point theorem. According to this theorem, if two chords \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) intersect at a point \\(P\\) inside a circle, then the products of the segments of each chord are equal. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\nAP \\cdot PB = CP \\cdot PD\n\\]\n\nWe are given:\n- \\(AP = 3\\)\n- \\(CP = 8\\)\n\nWe need to find \\(\\frac{BP}{DP}\\).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(BP = x\\)\n- \\(DP = y\\)\n\nAccording to the Power of a Point theorem:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot x = 8 \\cdot y\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{8}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(\\frac{BP}{DP}\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<2.6667>>>"
