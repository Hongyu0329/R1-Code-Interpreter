    "\nassistant > In a trapezoid, the sum of the interior angles is \\(360^\\circ\\). If the consecutive angles form an arithmetic sequence, we can denote the angles as \\(a\\), \\(a+d\\), \\(a+2d\\), and \\(a+3d\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\nGiven that the largest angle is \\(120^\\circ\\), we have:\n\\[ a + 3d = 120 \\]\n\nThe sum of the angles is:\n\\[ a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) = 360 \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ 4a + 6d = 360 \\]\n\nNow, we have the system of equations:\n1. \\( a + 3d = 120 \\)\n2. \\( 4a + 6d = 360 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(d\\). Let's solve these equations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\na, d = symbols('a d')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(a + 3*d, 120)\neq2 = Eq(4*a + 6*d, 360)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, d))\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of equations is \\(a = 60\\) and \\(d = 20\\).
