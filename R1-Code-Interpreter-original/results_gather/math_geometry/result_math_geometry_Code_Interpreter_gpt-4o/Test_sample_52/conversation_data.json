    "\nassistant > To find the area of the polygon, we first need to determine the length of each side. Given that the perimeter of the polygon is 56 and there are 28 congruent sides, we can calculate the length of each side as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of each side} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{56}{28} = 2\n\\]\n\nThe polygon is composed of a series of connected squares, each with side length 2. To find the area, we need to determine how many such squares make up the polygon.\n\nThe polygon is a 14-sided shape with each side being part of a square. Since each square has an area of \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), we can calculate the total area by multiplying the number of squares by the area of each square.\n\nLet's calculate the number of squares and the total area.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given values\nperimeter = 56\nnum_sides = 28\nside_length = perimeter / num_sides\n\n# Calculate the number of squares\n# Each square contributes 4 sides, and there are 28 sides in total\nnum_squares = num_sides // 4\n\n# Calculate the area of the polygon\narea_per_square = side_length ** 2\ntotal_area = num_squares * area_per_square\ntotal_area\nassistant > The area of the polygon is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<28>>>."
