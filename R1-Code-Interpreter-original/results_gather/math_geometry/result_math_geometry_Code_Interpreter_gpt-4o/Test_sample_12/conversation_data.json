    "\nassistant > To find the radius of the sphere that is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of the truncated cone, we can use the formula for the radius of the inscribed sphere in a truncated cone. The formula is given by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{r_1 \\cdot r_2 \\cdot h}{\\sqrt{(r_1 - r_2)^2 + h^2}}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are the radii of the top and bottom bases of the truncated cone, respectively.\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the truncated cone.\n\nHowever, in this problem, the height \\( h \\) is not given directly. We can find the height using the geometry of the truncated cone and the fact that the sphere is tangent to the lateral surface.\n\nThe height \\( h \\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, the difference in radii, and the slant height of the cone. The slant height \\( l \\) is the distance from the edge of the top base to the edge of the bottom base along the lateral surface.\n\nThe slant height \\( l \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nl = \\sqrt{(r_1 - r_2)^2 + h^2}\n\\]\n\nSince the sphere is tangent to the lateral surface, the radius of the sphere is also the distance from the center of the sphere to the lateral surface. This distance is equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\nLet's solve for the radius of the sphere using these relationships.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, sqrt\n\n# Define the symbols\nr1, r2, h, r = symbols('r1 r2 h r')\n\n# Given radii of the top and bottom bases\nr1_value = 18\nr2_value = 2\n\n# Equation for the radius of the sphere\nequation = r - (r1 * r2 * h) / sqrt((r1 - r2)**2 + h**2)\n\n# Solve for the height h in terms of r\nh_expr = solve(equation, h)[0]\n\n# Substitute the given values of r1 and r2\nh_expr = h_expr.subs({r1: r1_value, r2: r2_value})\n\n# Solve for the radius of the sphere\nradius_of_sphere = solve(h_expr - r, r)[0]\nradius_of_sphere.evalf()\nassistant > It seems there was an error in the approach. Let's try a different method to find the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe sphere is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surfaces of the truncated cone. This means that the center of the sphere lies on the axis of the cone, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the top and bottom bases is equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\nLet's use the geometry of the truncated cone and the properties of the sphere to find the radius. The height of the truncated cone can be expressed in terms of the radius of the sphere. Let's solve for the radius of the sphere using this relationship.# Define the symbol for the radius of the sphere\nr_sphere = symbols('r_sphere')\n\n# The height of the truncated cone is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the sphere to the top base\n# The distance from the center of the sphere to the top base is equal to the radius of the sphere\n# Therefore, the height of the truncated cone is 2 * r_sphere\n\n# The slant height of the truncated cone is the distance from the edge of the top base to the edge of the bottom base along the lateral surface\n# This is given by the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt((r1 - r2)^2 + (2 * r_sphere)^2)\n\n# The radius of the sphere is also the distance from the center of the sphere to the lateral surface\n# This distance is equal to the radius of the sphere\n\n# Solve for the radius of the sphere\nradius_of_sphere = solve(r_sphere - (r1_value * r2_value * (2 * r_sphere)) / sqrt((r1_value - r2_value)**2 + (2 * r_sphere)**2), r_sphere)\nradius_of_sphere[0].evalf()\nassistant > It seems there is still an issue with the approach. Let's try a more straightforward geometric approach.\n\nThe sphere is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surfaces of the truncated cone. The center of the sphere lies on the axis of the cone, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the top and bottom bases is equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe height of the truncated cone can be expressed in terms of the radius of the sphere. Let's solve for the radius of the sphere using this relationship.\n\nThe key is to realize that the height of the truncated cone is twice the radius of the sphere, as the sphere is tangent to both the top and bottom bases. Let's solve for the radius of the sphere using this relationship.# Define the symbol for the radius of the sphere\nr_sphere = symbols('r_sphere')\n\n# The height of the truncated cone is twice the radius of the sphere\n# The slant height of the truncated cone is the distance from the edge of the top base to the edge of the bottom base along the lateral surface\n# This is given by the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt((r1 - r2)^2 + (2 * r_sphere)^2)\n\n# The radius of the sphere is also the distance from the center of the sphere to the lateral surface\n# This distance is equal to the radius of the sphere\n\n# Solve for the radius of the sphere\nradius_of_sphere = solve(r_sphere - (r1_value * r2_value * (2 * r_sphere)) / sqrt((r1_value - r2_value)**2 + (2 * r_sphere)**2), r_sphere)\nradius_of_sphere\nassistant > The solution gives us three possible values for the radius of the sphere: \\(0\\), \\(-4\\sqrt{77}\\), and \\(4\\sqrt{77}\\). Since the radius of a sphere cannot be negative or zero, the valid solution is \\(4\\sqrt{77}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value of \\(4\\sqrt{77}\\).# Calculate the numerical value of 4 * sqrt(77)\nradius_value = 4 * sqrt(77)\nradius_value.evalf()\nassistant > The radius of the sphere is approximately \\(35.10\\). Therefore, the radius of the sphere is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{35.10}\n\\]\n\nIn the required format, the answer is:\n\n<<<35.10>>>"
