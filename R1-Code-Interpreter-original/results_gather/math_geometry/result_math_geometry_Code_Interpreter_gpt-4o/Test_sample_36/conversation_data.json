    "\nassistant > To find the length of the segment from \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\), we first need to determine the coordinates of \\( C' \\) after reflecting \\( C \\) over the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\nThe reflection of a point \\((x, y)\\) over the \\( y \\)-axis is \\((-x, y)\\).\n\nGiven the coordinates of \\( C \\) are \\((-3, 2)\\), the coordinates of \\( C' \\) after reflection will be \\((3, 2)\\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance between \\( C(-3, 2) \\) and \\( C'(3, 2) \\) using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(3 - (-3))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(3 + 3)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{6^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the segment from \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\) is 6.\n\nThe final answer is <<<6>>>."
