    "\nassistant > To find the area of the octagon, we first need to determine the side length of the square and then the side length of the octagon.\n\n1. **Find the side length of the square:**\n\n   The perimeter of the square is given as 108 cm. Since a square has four equal sides, the side length \\( s \\) of the square is:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{108}{4} = 27 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the side length of the octagon:**\n\n   The vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. This means each side of the square is divided into three equal parts. Therefore, each segment is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n   The octagon is formed by cutting off the corners of the square. Each corner of the square is a right triangle with legs of 9 cm each. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the side of the octagon.\n\n   Using the Pythagorean theorem, the side length \\( a \\) of the octagon is:\n   \\[\n   a = \\sqrt{9^2 + 9^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 81} = \\sqrt{162} = 9\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the octagon:**\n\n   The area \\( A \\) of a regular octagon with side length \\( a \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = 2(1 + \\sqrt{2})a^2\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting \\( a = 9\\sqrt{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   A = 2(1 + \\sqrt{2})(9\\sqrt{2})^2\n   \\]\n\n   Let's calculate this area.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Side length of the octagon\na = 9 * math.sqrt(2)\n\n# Area of the octagon\narea_octagon = 2 * (1 + math.sqrt(2)) * a**2\narea_octagon\nassistant > The area of the octagon is approximately \\( 782.21 \\) square centimeters.\n\nThus, the number of square centimeters in the area of the octagon is:\n\n<<<782.21>>>"
