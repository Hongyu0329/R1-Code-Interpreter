    "\nassistant > To find the area of the square, we need to determine its side length. The arrangement of the circles provides a clue.\n\nEach circle has a radius of 5 inches. The centers of the circles are positioned at the corners of a smaller square within the larger square. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is equal to the diameter of a circle, which is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) inches.\n\nSince there are two circles along each side of the square, the side length of the square is equal to the sum of the diameters of two circles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of the square} = 10 + 10 = 20 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of the square:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the square} = \\text{side length}^2 = 20^2 = 400 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the square is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{400}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is <<<400>>>."
