    "\nassistant > To find the volume of the new pyramid that is cut off by the plane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the height of the original pyramid:**\n\n   The original pyramid is a right square pyramid with a base edge of \\(8\\sqrt{2}\\) units and slant edges of 10 units. The slant height forms a right triangle with half the base diagonal and the height of the pyramid.\n\n   The diagonal of the base is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Diagonal} = \\sqrt{(8\\sqrt{2})^2 + (8\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{128 + 128} = \\sqrt{256} = 16\n   \\]\n\n   Half of the diagonal is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n\n   Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the slant height, half the diagonal, and the height of the pyramid:\n   \\[\n   10^2 = 8^2 + h^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100 = 64 + h^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h^2 = 36 \\implies h = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the height of the new pyramid:**\n\n   The plane cuts the pyramid 3 units above the base, so the height of the new pyramid is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 3 = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the side length of the base of the new pyramid:**\n\n   The new pyramid is similar to the original pyramid. The ratio of the heights is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the side length of the base of the new pyramid is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the volume of the new pyramid:**\n\n   The area of the base of the new pyramid is:\n   \\[\n   (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32\n   \\]\n\n   The volume of the new pyramid is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 32 \\times 3 = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the new pyramid is \\(\\boxed{32}\\) cubic units.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<32>>>."
