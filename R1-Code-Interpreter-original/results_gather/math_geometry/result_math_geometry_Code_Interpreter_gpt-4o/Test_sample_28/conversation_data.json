    "\nassistant > To find the coordinates of Point \\( B \\) after reflecting Point \\( A \\) over the \\( y \\)-axis, we need to understand how reflections over the \\( y \\)-axis work. \n\nWhen a point \\((x, y)\\) is reflected over the \\( y \\)-axis, its \\( x \\)-coordinate changes sign, while the \\( y \\)-coordinate remains the same. Therefore, if Point \\( A \\) has coordinates \\((x, 6)\\), then Point \\( B \\), the reflection of Point \\( A \\) over the \\( y \\)-axis, will have coordinates \\((-x, 6)\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the four coordinate values of Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n- Coordinates of Point \\( A \\): \\((x, 6)\\)\n- Coordinates of Point \\( B \\): \\((-x, 6)\\)\n\nThe sum of these coordinates is:\n\\[\nx + 6 + (-x) + 6\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the sum of the coordinates\nx = 0  # x will cancel out, so we can set it to any value\nsum_of_coordinates = x + 6 + (-x) + 6\nsum_of_coordinates\nassistant > The sum of the four coordinate values of points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<12>>>."
