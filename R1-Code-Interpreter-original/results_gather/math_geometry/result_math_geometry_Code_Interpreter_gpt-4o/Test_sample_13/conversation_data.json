    "\nassistant > To determine the possible whole number values of \\( n \\) that allow the three sticks to form a triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. The theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven the sides of lengths 5 cm, 9 cm, and \\( n \\) cm, the inequalities are:\n\n1. \\( 5 + 9 > n \\)\n2. \\( 5 + n > 9 \\)\n3. \\( 9 + n > 5 \\)\n\nLet's solve these inequalities to find the range of possible values for \\( n \\).\n\n1. \\( 5 + 9 > n \\) simplifies to \\( n < 14 \\).\n2. \\( 5 + n > 9 \\) simplifies to \\( n > 4 \\).\n3. \\( 9 + n > 5 \\) simplifies to \\( n > -4 \\).\n\nThe third inequality \\( n > -4 \\) is always true for positive \\( n \\), so it doesn't affect the range. Therefore, the possible values for \\( n \\) are those that satisfy:\n\n\\[ 4 < n < 14 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be a whole number, the possible values for \\( n \\) are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of these possible values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the sum of possible whole number values of n\npossible_values = list(range(5, 14))\nsum_of_values = sum(possible_values)\nsum_of_values\nassistant > The sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<81>>>."
