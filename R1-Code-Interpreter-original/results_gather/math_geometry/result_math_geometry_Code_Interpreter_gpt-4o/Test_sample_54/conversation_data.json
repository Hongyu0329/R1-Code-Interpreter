    "\nassistant > To find the value of \\( W \\), we need to calculate the volume of the space inside the sphere and outside the cylinder. This involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the sphere**: The volume \\( V_s \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_s = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   For a sphere with radius 5 units, the volume is:\n   \\[\n   V_s = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the height of the cylinder**: Since the cylinder is inscribed in the sphere, the diagonal of the cylinder (which is the diameter of the sphere) is equal to the diameter of the sphere. The diagonal of the cylinder can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\) of the cylinder:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(2r)^2 + h^2} = 2 \\times \\text{radius of sphere}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(2 \\times 3)^2 + h^2} = 2 \\times 5\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( h \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{36 + h^2} = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   36 + h^2 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h^2 = 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the volume of the cylinder**: The volume \\( V_c \\) of a cylinder with base radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_c = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   For a cylinder with base radius 3 units and height 8 units, the volume is:\n   \\[\n   V_c = \\pi (3)^2 (8)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the volume of the space inside the sphere and outside the cylinder**: This is the difference between the volume of the sphere and the volume of the cylinder:\n   \\[\n   V = V_s - V_c\n   \\]\n\n5. **Express the result in terms of \\( W \\pi \\)**: The volume \\( V \\) can be expressed as \\( W \\pi \\), and we need to find \\( W \\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Given values\nradius_sphere = 5\nradius_cylinder = 3\n\n# Volume of the sphere\nV_s = (4/3) * sp.pi * radius_sphere**3\n\n# Height of the cylinder\nh = sp.sqrt(100 - 36)\n\n# Volume of the cylinder\nV_c = sp.pi * radius_cylinder**2 * h\n\n# Volume of the space inside the sphere and outside the cylinder\nV = V_s - V_c\n\n# Express the result in terms of W * pi\nW = V / sp.pi\nW.evalf()\nassistant > The value of \\( W \\) is \\(\\frac{284}{3}\\).
