    "\nassistant > To find the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere in which the rectangular box \\( P \\) is inscribed, we need to use the given information about the box:\n\n1. The surface area of the box is 384.\n2. The sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\n\n1. Surface area: \n   \\[\n   2(ab + bc + ca) = 384\n   \\]\n\n2. Sum of the edges:\n   \\[\n   4(a + b + c) = 112\n   \\]\n\n3. Since the box is inscribed in a sphere, the diagonal of the box is equal to the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, the diagonal \\( d \\) of the box is:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 2r\n   \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations to find \\( r \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt\n\n# Define the variables\na, b, c, r = symbols('a b c r', positive=True, real=True)\n\n# Given equations\neq1 = Eq(2 * (a*b + b*c + c*a), 384)\neq2 = Eq(4 * (a + b + c), 112)\neq3 = Eq(sqrt(a**2 + b**2 + c**2), 2*r)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (a, b, c, r))\nsolution\nassistant > The solutions for the system of equations give us two sets of values for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), but both result in the same radius \\( r = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, the radius of the sphere is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<10>>>."
