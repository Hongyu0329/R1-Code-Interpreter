    "\nassistant > To find the length of the common chord of the two overlapping circles, we can use the following geometric approach:\n\n1. Consider the two circles with centers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), each with a radius of 10 cm. The distance between the centers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is also 10 cm, as each circle passes through the center of the other.\n\n2. The common chord is perpendicular to the line segment \\( AB \\) and bisects it. Let \\( M \\) be the midpoint of \\( AB \\). The length of \\( AM \\) (or \\( BM \\)) is half of \\( AB \\), which is 5 cm.\n\n3. The common chord is the base of an isosceles triangle \\( \\triangle AMC \\) (or \\( \\triangle BMC \\)), where \\( AC = 10 \\) cm (radius of the circle) and \\( AM = 5 \\) cm.\n\n4. We can use the Pythagorean theorem in \\( \\triangle AMC \\) to find the length of \\( MC \\), which is half the length of the common chord.\n\n\\[\nAC^2 = AM^2 + MC^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10^2 = 5^2 + MC^2\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( MC \\) and then find the full length of the common chord.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nAC = 10  # radius of the circle\nAM = 5   # half the distance between the centers\n\n# Using the Pythagorean theorem to find MC\nMC = math.sqrt(AC**2 - AM**2)\n\n# The full length of the common chord is twice MC\ncommon_chord_length = 2 * MC\ncommon_chord_length\nassistant > The length of the common chord is \\( 17.32 \\) cm, which can be expressed in simplest radical form as \\( 10\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<10âˆš3>>>."
