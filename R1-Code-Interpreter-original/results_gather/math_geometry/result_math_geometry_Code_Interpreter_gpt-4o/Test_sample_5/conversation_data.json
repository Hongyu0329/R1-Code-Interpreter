    "\nassistant > In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these sides are also equal. Let's denote the angles of the triangle as \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), where \\( A = B = 40^\\circ \\) because they are opposite the equal sides.\n\nThe sum of the angles in any triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\). Therefore, we can find the measure of the third angle \\( C \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nC = 180^\\circ - A - B = 180^\\circ - 40^\\circ - 40^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest angle in the triangle is \\( 100^\\circ \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]\n\nSo, the measure of the triangle's largest angle is <<<100>>>."
