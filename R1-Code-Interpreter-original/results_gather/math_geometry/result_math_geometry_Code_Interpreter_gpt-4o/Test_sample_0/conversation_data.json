    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the original square ABCD:**\n   - The area of the square is given as 4 square units. Therefore, the side length \\( s \\) of the square is:\n     \\[\n     s = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the coordinates of the vertices of the original square:**\n   - The center of the square is at \\((8, -8)\\).\n   - Since the top side of the square is horizontal, the vertices of the square can be calculated as follows:\n     - Top-right vertex: \\((8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7)\\)\n     - Top-left vertex: \\((8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7)\\)\n     - Bottom-right vertex: \\((8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9)\\)\n     - Bottom-left vertex: \\((8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9)\\)\n\n3. **Dilate the square with a scale factor of 2 centered at the origin (0,0):**\n   - The dilation formula for a point \\((x, y)\\) with respect to the origin is:\n     \\[\n     (x', y') = (k \\cdot x, k \\cdot y)\n     \\]\n     where \\( k \\) is the scale factor.\n   - Applying this to each vertex with \\( k = 2 \\):\n     - Top-right vertex: \\((2 \\cdot 9, 2 \\cdot -7) = (18, -14)\\)\n     - Top-left vertex: \\((2 \\cdot 7, 2 \\cdot -7) = (14, -14)\\)\n     - Bottom-right vertex: \\((2 \\cdot 9, 2 \\cdot -9) = (18, -18)\\)\n     - Bottom-left vertex: \\((2 \\cdot 7, 2 \\cdot -9) = (14, -18)\\)\n\n4. **Determine the vertex farthest from the origin:**\n   - Calculate the distance from the origin for each vertex:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n     \\]\n   - Compare the distances to find the farthest vertex.\n\nLet's calculate the distances and find the farthest vertex.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Original vertices after dilation\nvertices = [(18, -14), (14, -14), (18, -18), (14, -18)]\n\n# Calculate distances from the origin for each vertex\ndistances = [(x, y, math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)) for x, y in vertices]\n\n# Find the vertex with the maximum distance\nfarthest_vertex = max(distances, key=lambda item: item[2])\n\nfarthest_vertex_coordinates = (farthest_vertex[0], farthest_vertex[1])\nfarthest_vertex_coordinates\nassistant > The vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin is \\((18, -18)\\).\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<18, -18>>>."
