    "\nassistant > To find the area of triangle ABC, we need to determine the side length of the equilateral triangle using the given area of the inscribed circle.\n\n1. **Find the radius of the circle:**\n\n   The area of the circle is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\pi r^2 = 4\\pi\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( r \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   r^2 = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate the radius to the side length of the equilateral triangle:**\n\n   For an equilateral triangle, the radius \\( r \\) of the inscribed circle is given by:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n   \\]\n   where \\( s \\) is the side length of the triangle.\n\n   Substituting \\( r = 2 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   2 = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( s \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:**\n\n   The area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( s = 4\\sqrt{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (4\\sqrt{3})^2\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate the area.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Side length of the equilateral triangle\ns = 4 * sp.sqrt(3)\n\n# Area of the equilateral triangle\nA = (sp.sqrt(3) / 4) * s**2\nA.simplify()\nassistant > The area of triangle ABC is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}\\) square centimeters.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<12*sqrt(3)>>>."
