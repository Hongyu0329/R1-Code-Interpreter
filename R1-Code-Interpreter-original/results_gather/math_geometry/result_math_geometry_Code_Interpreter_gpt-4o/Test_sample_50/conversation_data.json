    "\nassistant > To find the area of the shaded region in the regular hexagon, we first need to calculate the area of the entire hexagon and then determine the area of the shaded region.\n\nA regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The side length of each equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon, which is 10 cm.\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of one equilateral triangle and then multiply it by 6 to get the area of the hexagon. After that, we will calculate the area of the shaded region, which is a quadrilateral formed by connecting the midpoints of the hexagon's sides.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Side length of the hexagon\ns = 10\n\n# Area of one equilateral triangle\narea_triangle = (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * s**2\n\n# Area of the hexagon (6 equilateral triangles)\narea_hexagon = 6 * area_triangle\n\n# Calculate the area of the shaded region\n# The shaded region is a quadrilateral formed by connecting the midpoints of the hexagon's sides\n# The area of the shaded region is 2/3 of the area of the hexagon\narea_shaded = (2/3) * area_hexagon\n\narea_shaded_simplified = area_shaded / math.sqrt(3)\n\narea_shaded_simplified\nassistant > The area of the shaded region in the regular hexagon is \\(\\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}\\) square centimeters."
