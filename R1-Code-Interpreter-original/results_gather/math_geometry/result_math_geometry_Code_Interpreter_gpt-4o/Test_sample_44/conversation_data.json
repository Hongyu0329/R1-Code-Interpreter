    "\nassistant > To find the surface area of the sphere, we first need to determine its radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the volume and \\( r \\) is the radius. We know that the volume is \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = 36\\pi\n\\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( r^3 \\) by dividing both sides by \\(\\pi\\) and then multiplying by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\nr^3 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 36\n\\]\n\nOnce we find \\( r \\), we can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere:\n\n\\[\nA = 4 \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the radius and then the surface area.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, pi\n\n# Define the variable\nr = symbols('r')\n\n# Given volume\nvolume = 36 * pi\n\n# Equation for volume of a sphere\nvolume_eq = (4/3) * pi * r**3 - volume\n\n# Solve for r\nradius = solve(volume_eq, r)[0]\n\n# Calculate surface area\nsurface_area = 4 * pi * radius**2\nsurface_area\nassistant > The surface area of the sphere is \\(\\boxed{36\\pi}\\) square inches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is <<<36.0\\pi>>>."
