    "\nassistant > To find the total area of the four triangular faces of the right, square-based pyramid, we need to calculate the area of one triangular face and then multiply it by four.\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the triangular face:**\n   - The base of each triangular face is the side of the square base, which is 6 units.\n   - The lateral edge of the pyramid is 5 units, which serves as the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the height of the triangular face, half of the base, and the lateral edge.\n\n2. **Calculate the height of the triangular face:**\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by half of the base, the height of the triangular face, and the lateral edge:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 + \\text{height}^2 = 5^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^2 + \\text{height}^2 = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     9 + \\text{height}^2 = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{height}^2 = 16\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{height} = 4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of one triangular face:**\n   - The area of a triangle is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - For one triangular face:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 4 = 12\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total area of the four triangular faces:**\n   - Total area = 4 times the area of one triangular face:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Area} = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total area of the four triangular faces is \\(\\boxed{48}\\) square units.\n\nFinal answer: <<<48>>>"
