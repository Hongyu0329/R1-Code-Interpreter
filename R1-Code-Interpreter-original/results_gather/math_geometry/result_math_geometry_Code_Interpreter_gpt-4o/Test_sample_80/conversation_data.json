    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle given that a circle with radius 4 cm is tangent to three sides of the rectangle, and the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle.\n\n1. **Area of the Circle:**\n   The area \\( A \\) of a circle with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   For a circle with radius 4 cm:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of the Rectangle:**\n   The area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of rectangle} = 2 \\times 16\\pi = 32\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Dimensions of the Rectangle:**\n   Let the dimensions of the rectangle be \\( l \\) (length) and \\( w \\) (width). The area of the rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   l \\times w = 32\\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **Circle Tangent to Three Sides:**\n   Since the circle is tangent to three sides of the rectangle, it must be tangent to two adjacent sides and one opposite side. This implies that the distance from the center of the circle to the two adjacent sides is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 4 cm.\n\n   Therefore, if the circle is tangent to the width \\( w \\) and one length \\( l \\), then:\n   \\[\n   w = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Length \\( l \\):**\n   Using the area equation:\n   \\[\n   l \\times 8 = 32\\pi\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( l \\):\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{32\\pi}{8} = 4\\pi\n   \\]\n\nThus, the length of the longer side of the rectangle is \\( 4\\pi \\) cm.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4\\pi}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the longer side of the rectangle is <<<4\\pi>>>."
