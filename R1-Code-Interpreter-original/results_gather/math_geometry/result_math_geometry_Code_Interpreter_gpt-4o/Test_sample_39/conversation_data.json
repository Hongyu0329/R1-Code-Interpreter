    "\nassistant > To determine the worth of a three-inch cube of silver, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the two-inch cube and the three-inch cube.\n2. Determine the value per cubic inch of silver using the two-inch cube.\n3. Use the value per cubic inch to find the worth of the three-inch cube.\n\nLet's go through these calculations:\n\n1. **Volume Calculation:**\n   - Volume of a cube is given by \\( V = \\text{side}^3 \\).\n   - Volume of the two-inch cube: \\( V_2 = 2^3 = 8 \\) cubic inches.\n   - Volume of the three-inch cube: \\( V_3 = 3^3 = 27 \\) cubic inches.\n\n2. **Value per Cubic Inch:**\n   - The two-inch cube is worth $200 for 8 cubic inches.\n   - Value per cubic inch = \\(\\frac{200}{8}\\).\n\n3. **Worth of the Three-Inch Cube:**\n   - Worth of the three-inch cube = Value per cubic inch \\(\\times\\) Volume of the three-inch cube.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given values\nvalue_two_inch_cube = 200  # dollars\nvolume_two_inch_cube = 2**3  # cubic inches\nvolume_three_inch_cube = 3**3  # cubic inches\n\n# Calculate value per cubic inch\nvalue_per_cubic_inch = value_two_inch_cube / volume_two_inch_cube\n\n# Calculate worth of the three-inch cube\nworth_three_inch_cube = value_per_cubic_inch * volume_three_inch_cube\n\n# Round to the nearest dollar\nworth_three_inch_cube_rounded = round(worth_three_inch_cube)\n\nworth_three_inch_cube_rounded\nassistant > The three-inch cube of silver is worth approximately \\(\\$675\\). \n\nThus, the final answer is <<<675>>>."
