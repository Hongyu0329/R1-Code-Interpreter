    "\nassistant > To find the area of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of the pattern, we need to consider the arrangement of semicircles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:**\n   - The semicircles have a diameter of 2 inches, which means each semicircle has a radius of 1 inch.\n   - The pattern consists of alternating semicircles facing up and down.\n\n2. **Length of the Pattern:**\n   - 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.\n   - Since each semicircle has a diameter of 2 inches, there are \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) semicircles in a 1-foot length.\n\n3. **Area of a Single Semicircle:**\n   - The area of a full circle with radius \\( r \\) is \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - The area of a semicircle is half of that: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - For a semicircle with radius 1 inch, the area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Total Area of Semicircles in 1-Foot Length:**\n   - There are 6 semicircles in total, 3 facing up and 3 facing down.\n   - The total area of these semicircles is \\( 6 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 3\\pi \\).\n\n5. **Shaded Region:**\n   - The shaded region is the area between the alternating semicircles.\n   - Since the semicircles are perfectly aligned, the shaded region is the area of the semicircles themselves.\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of this pattern is \\( 3\\pi \\) square inches.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3\\pi>>>"
