    "\nassistant > To find the area of the interior region formed by the lines \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), and the \\( y \\)-axis, we need to determine the points of intersection of these lines and the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n1. **Intersection with the \\( y \\)-axis:**\n   - For \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\): \\( y = 2(0) - 4 = -4 \\). So, the intersection point is \\( (0, -4) \\).\n   - For \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\): \\( y = -3(0) + 16 = 16 \\). So, the intersection point is \\( (0, 16) \\).\n\n2. **Intersection of the lines \\( y = 2x - 4 \\) and \\( y = -3x + 16 \\):**\n   - Set \\( 2x - 4 = -3x + 16 \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's calculate the intersection point of the two lines and then determine the area of the triangle formed by these points.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equations of the lines\nline1 = Eq(y, 2*x - 4)\nline2 = Eq(y, -3*x + 16)\n\n# Solve for intersection of line1 and line2\nintersection_point = solve((line1, line2), (x, y))\nintersection_point\nassistant > The intersection point of the lines \\( y = 2x - 4 \\) and \\( y = -3x + 16 \\) is \\( (4, 4) \\).\n\nNow, we have the vertices of the triangle formed by these lines and the \\( y \\)-axis:\n- \\( (0, -4) \\) from the line \\( y = 2x - 4 \\) and the \\( y \\)-axis.\n- \\( (0, 16) \\) from the line \\( y = -3x + 16 \\) and the \\( y \\)-axis.\n- \\( (4, 4) \\) from the intersection of the two lines.\n\nTo find the area of the triangle with vertices \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the area of the triangle.# Coordinates of the vertices\nx1, y1 = 0, -4\nx2, y2 = 0, 16\nx3, y3 = 4, 4\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula\narea = 0.5 * abs(x1*(y2-y3) + x2*(y3-y1) + x3*(y1-y2))\narea\nassistant > The area of the interior region formed by the lines \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), and the \\( y \\)-axis is \\(\\boxed{40.0}\\) square units.\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<40.0>>>."
