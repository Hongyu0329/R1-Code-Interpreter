    "\nassistant > To find the factor by which the volume of the cylinder is multiplied, we need to compare the initial volume of the cylinder with the new volume after the changes.\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nLet's denote the initial radius as \\( r \\) and the initial height as \\( h \\).\n\n1. **Initial Volume**: \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{initial}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n\n2. **New Dimensions**: \n   - The height is doubled: \\( h_{\\text{new}} = 2h \\).\n   - The radius is increased by 200%, which means the new radius is \\( r_{\\text{new}} = r + 2r = 3r \\).\n\n3. **New Volume**:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (3r)^2 (2h) = \\pi \\times 9r^2 \\times 2h = 18\\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n\n4. **Factor of Increase**:\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{V_{\\text{new}}}{V_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{18\\pi r^2 h}{\\pi r^2 h} = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cylinder is multiplied by a factor of 18.\n\nThe value of \\( X \\) is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<18>>>"
