    "\nassistant > To find the total surface area of the hemisphere, we need to first determine the radius of the hemisphere using the given area of the base.\n\nThe area of the base of a hemisphere is the area of a circle, which is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n\nWe are given that the area of the base is \\( 100\\pi \\), so:\n\\[\n\\pi r^2 = 100\\pi\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\( r^2 \\):\n\\[\nr^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\\[\nr = 10\n\\]\n\nThe total surface area of a hemisphere is the sum of the curved surface area and the base area. The curved surface area of a hemisphere is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Curved Surface Area} = 2\\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nThe total surface area of the hemisphere is then:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Surface Area} = 2\\pi r^2 + \\pi r^2 = 3\\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r^2 = 100 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Surface Area} = 3\\pi \\times 100 = 300\\pi\n\\]\n\nThus, the total surface area of the hemisphere is \\( 300\\pi \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{300\\pi}\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer in the required format is:\n<<<300\\pi>>>"
