    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the region bounded by the arcs of the circles. Each circle has a radius of 4 units and a central angle of 60 degrees.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of one sector:**\n\n   The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of sector} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\times \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\theta\\) is the central angle in degrees and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n   For our problem, \\(\\theta = 60^\\circ\\) and \\(r = 4\\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one sector} = \\frac{60}{360} \\times \\pi \\times 4^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\pi \\times 16 = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:**\n\n   The three arcs intersect at points of tangency, forming an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the radius of the circles, which is 4 units.\n\n   The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of equilateral triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n   \\]\n\n   For our problem, \\(s = 4\\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of equilateral triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 4^2 = 4\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the region:**\n\n   The region is formed by three sectors minus the equilateral triangle. Therefore, the area of the region is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of region} = 3 \\times \\frac{8\\pi}{3} - 4\\sqrt{3} = 8\\pi - 4\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n   This can be expressed in the form \\(a\\sqrt{b} + c\\pi\\), where \\(a = -4\\), \\(b = 3\\), and \\(c = 8\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(a + b + c\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = -4 + 3 + 8 = 7\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(a + b + c\\) is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<7>>>."
