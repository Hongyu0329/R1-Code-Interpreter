    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the length of an arc, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Arc Length} = r \\cdot \\theta \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle and \\( \\theta \\) is the angle in radians.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( r_1 \\) as the radius of the smaller circle.\n- \\( r_2 \\) as the radius of the larger circle.\n\nAccording to the problem, the arc length on the smaller circle formed by a 45-degree angle is equal to the arc length on the larger circle formed by a 36-degree angle.\n\nFirst, we need to convert these angles from degrees to radians:\n- \\( 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians\n- \\( 36^\\circ = \\frac{36\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\) radians\n\nNow, we can set up the equation for the arc lengths:\n\n\\[ r_1 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} = r_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation for the ratio \\( \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\):\n\n\\[ r_1 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} = r_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\pi/4} = \\frac{4}{5} \\]\n\nThe ratio of the radii is \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\).\n\nThe area of a circle is given by \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the smaller circle to the larger circle is:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle is \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<16/25>>>"
