    "\nassistant > To find the area of the gray region, we need to calculate the area of the outer circle and subtract the area of the inner circle.\n\n1. **Determine the radii of the circles:**\n   - Let \\( r \\) be the radius of the inner circle.\n   - The radius of the outer circle is twice the radius of the inner circle, so it is \\( 2r \\).\n\n2. **Given information:**\n   - The width of the gray region is 2 feet. This means the difference between the radii of the outer and inner circles is 2 feet.\n   - Therefore, \\( 2r - r = 2 \\), which implies \\( r = 2 \\) feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the radii:**\n   - Inner circle radius \\( r = 2 \\) feet.\n   - Outer circle radius \\( 2r = 4 \\) feet.\n\n4. **Calculate the areas:**\n   - Area of the outer circle: \\( \\pi \\times (4)^2 = 16\\pi \\).\n   - Area of the inner circle: \\( \\pi \\times (2)^2 = 4\\pi \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the gray region:**\n   - Area of the gray region = Area of the outer circle - Area of the inner circle\n   - \\( 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi \\).\n\nThus, the area of the gray region is \\( 12\\pi \\) square feet.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<12\\pi>>>"
