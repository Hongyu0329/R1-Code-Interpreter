    "\nassistant > To find the area of the WIN sector, we first need to calculate the total area of the circular spinner and then determine the area of the sector corresponding to the probability of winning.\n\n1. **Calculate the total area of the circle:**\n\n   The formula for the area of a circle is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. Here, \\( r = 10 \\) cm.\n\n2. **Calculate the area of the WIN sector:**\n\n   The probability of winning is given as \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\). This means the WIN sector covers \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the total area of the circle.\n\n   Therefore, the area of the WIN sector is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of WIN sector} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the radius and probability\nr = 10\nprobability_of_winning = sp.Rational(2, 5)\n\n# Calculate the total area of the circle\ntotal_area = sp.pi * r**2\n\n# Calculate the area of the WIN sector\nwin_sector_area = probability_of_winning * total_area\nwin_sector_area\nassistant > The area of the WIN sector is \\(40\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n\nThus, the final answer is <<<40\\pi>>>."
