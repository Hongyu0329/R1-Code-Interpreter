    "\nassistant > To find the number of diagonals in a cube, we need to consider the different types of diagonals:\n\n1. **Face Diagonals**: These are diagonals on each face of the cube. Each face of the cube is a square, and a square has 2 diagonals. Since a cube has 6 faces, the total number of face diagonals is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Space Diagonals**: These are diagonals that pass through the interior of the cube, connecting two opposite vertices. A cube has 8 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices by edges and to 3 other vertices by face diagonals. The remaining vertex is connected by a space diagonal. Therefore, each vertex is the endpoint of 1 space diagonal. Since there are 8 vertices, and each space diagonal is counted twice (once at each endpoint), the total number of space diagonals is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n\nAdding the face diagonals and space diagonals gives the total number of diagonals in the cube:\n\\[\n12 + 4 = 16\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of diagonals in a cube is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<16>>>."
