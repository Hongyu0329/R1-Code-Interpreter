    "\nassistant > To find the radius of the sphere inscribed in the cone, we can use the formula for the radius \\( r \\) of a sphere inscribed in a right circular cone:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{R \\cdot H}{\\sqrt{R^2 + H^2} + R}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( R \\) is the base radius of the cone and \\( H \\) is the height of the cone.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = 12 \\) cm\n- \\( H = 24 \\) cm\n\nLet's calculate the radius \\( r \\) of the inscribed sphere.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nR = 12  # base radius of the cone in cm\nH = 24  # height of the cone in cm\n\n# Calculate the radius of the inscribed sphere\nr = (R * H) / (math.sqrt(R**2 + H**2) + R)\nr\nassistant > The radius of the inscribed sphere is approximately \\( 7.416 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\nThe problem states that the radius can be expressed as \\( a\\sqrt{c} - a \\). Let's equate this to the calculated radius and solve for \\( a \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n\\[\na\\sqrt{c} - a = 7.416\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n\\[\na(\\sqrt{c} - 1) = 7.416\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( a \\) and \\( c \\), let's express \\( 7.416 \\) in the form \\( a(\\sqrt{c} - 1) \\). We can start by assuming a form and checking if it matches the calculated value. \n\nLet's try \\( a = 6 \\) and solve for \\( c \\).# Assume a = 6 and solve for c\na = 6\nc = ((r + a) / a) ** 2\nc\nassistant > By assuming \\( a = 6 \\), we find that \\( c \\approx 5 \\).\n\nThus, the radius of the sphere can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n6\\sqrt{5} - 6\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( a + c \\) is:\n\n\\[\na + c = 6 + 5 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).\n\n<<<11>>>"
