    "\nassistant > To find the length of the longest side of the triangle, we first need to determine the value of \\( x \\) using the given perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n7 + (x + 4) + (2x + 1) = 36\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation for \\( x \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation for the perimeter\nequation = Eq(7 + (x + 4) + (2*x + 1), 36)\n\n# Solve for x\nx_value = solve(equation, x)\nx_value\nassistant > The value of \\( x \\) is 8. Now, we can find the lengths of the sides of the triangle:\n\n1. The first side is 7.\n2. The second side is \\( x + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 \\).\n3. The third side is \\( 2x + 1 = 2(8) + 1 = 17 \\).\n\nThe longest side of the triangle is 17. Therefore, the length of the longest side is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is <<<17>>>."
