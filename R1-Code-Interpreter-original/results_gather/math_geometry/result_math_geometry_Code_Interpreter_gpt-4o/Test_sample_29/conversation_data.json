    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece of the cone.\n\nLet's denote the height of the cone as \\( h \\) and the radius of the base as \\( R \\). The cone is sliced into four pieces of equal height, so each piece has a height of \\( \\frac{h}{4} \\).\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base of the cone and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nSince the slices are parallel to the base, they form smaller cones. The height of each smaller cone is proportional to its distance from the apex of the original cone. The radii of the bases of these smaller cones are also proportional to their heights.\n\nLet's denote the radii of the bases of the smaller cones from top to bottom as \\( r_1, r_2, r_3, \\) and \\( r_4 \\). Since the heights are proportional, we have:\n\n\\[\nr_1 = \\frac{R}{4}, \\quad r_2 = \\frac{R}{2}, \\quad r_3 = \\frac{3R}{4}, \\quad r_4 = R\n\\]\n\nThe volumes of the smaller cones are:\n\n\\[\nV_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{R}{4}\\right)^2 \\frac{h}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nV_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{R}{2}\\right)^2 \\frac{h}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nV_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{3R}{4}\\right)^2 \\frac{3h}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nV_4 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi R^2 h\n\\]\n\nThe volumes of the pieces are the differences between the volumes of these cones:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{piece 1}} = V_1\n\\]\n\\[\nV_{\\text{piece 2}} = V_2 - V_1\n\\]\n\\[\nV_{\\text{piece 3}} = V_3 - V_2\n\\]\n\\[\nV_{\\text{piece 4}} = V_4 - V_3\n\\]\n\nThe largest piece is the one with the largest volume, which is \\( V_{\\text{piece 4}} \\), and the second-largest piece is \\( V_{\\text{piece 3}} \\).\n\nLet's calculate the volumes and find the ratio of \\( V_{\\text{piece 3}} \\) to \\( V_{\\text{piece 4}} \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, pi, Rational\n\n# Define symbols\nR, h = symbols('R h')\n\n# Calculate the volumes of the smaller cones\nV1 = Rational(1, 3) * pi * (R/4)**2 * (h/4)\nV2 = Rational(1, 3) * pi * (R/2)**2 * (h/2)\nV3 = Rational(1, 3) * pi * (3*R/4)**2 * (3*h/4)\nV4 = Rational(1, 3) * pi * R**2 * h\n\n# Calculate the volumes of the pieces\nV_piece_1 = V1\nV_piece_2 = V2 - V1\nV_piece_3 = V3 - V2\nV_piece_4 = V4 - V3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the second-largest piece to the largest piece\nratio = V_piece_3 / V_piece_4\nratio.simplify()\nassistant > The ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece is \\(\\frac{19}{37}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<19/37>>>."
