    "\nassistant > To find the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism, we need to determine the volumes of both the cone and the prism.\n\n1. **Volume of the Prism:**\n\n   The prism is a right rectangular prism (or a cuboid) with a square base. Let's assume the side length of the square base is \\( s \\) and the height of the prism is \\( h \\).\n\n   The volume of the prism \\( V_{\\text{prism}} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{prism}} = s^2 \\cdot h\n   \\]\n\n2. **Volume of the Cone:**\n\n   The cone is inscribed in the prism, meaning its base is a circle that fits perfectly within the square base of the prism. The diameter of the base of the cone is equal to the side length of the square base of the prism, \\( s \\). Therefore, the radius \\( r \\) of the base of the cone is \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\).\n\n   The height of the cone is the same as the height of the prism, \\( h \\).\n\n   The volume of the cone \\( V_{\\text{cone}} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\frac{s^2}{4} h = \\frac{\\pi s^2 h}{12}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ratio of the Volumes:**\n\n   The ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cone}}}{V_{\\text{prism}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi s^2 h}{12}}{s^2 h} = \\frac{\\pi}{12}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\\frac{\\pi}{12}>>>"
