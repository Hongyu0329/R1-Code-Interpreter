    "\nassistant > To find the area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of the larger circle and subtract the areas of the two smaller circles.\n\n1. **Area of the larger circle:**\n   - The larger circle circumscribes the two smaller circles. Since the smaller circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii, which is \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n   - The radius of the larger circle is the distance from its center to the center of one of the smaller circles plus the radius of that smaller circle. The centers of the smaller circles are 5 units apart, so the center of the larger circle is at the midpoint of the line segment joining the centers of the smaller circles. This midpoint is 2 units from the center of the circle with radius 2 and 3 units from the center of the circle with radius 3.\n   - Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is \\(5 + 2 = 7\\).\n\n2. **Area of the larger circle:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of the smaller circles:**\n   - Circle with radius 2: \\(\\pi \\times 2^2 = 4\\pi\\)\n   - Circle with radius 3: \\(\\pi \\times 3^2 = 9\\pi\\)\n\n4. **Area of the shaded region:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shaded Area} = 49\\pi - (4\\pi + 9\\pi) = 49\\pi - 13\\pi = 36\\pi\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region is \\(\\boxed{36\\pi}\\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<36\\pi>>>."
