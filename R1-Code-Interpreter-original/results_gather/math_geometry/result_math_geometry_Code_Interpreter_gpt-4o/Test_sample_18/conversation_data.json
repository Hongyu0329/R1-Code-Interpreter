    "\nassistant > To find the area of the shaded region, we need to understand the geometry of the problem. The circle has a radius of 4, and \\(PQ\\) and \\(RS\\) are perpendicular diameters. This means the circle is divided into four equal quadrants by these diameters.\n\nThe shaded region consists of two segments of the circle, each formed by a 90-degree angle (since the diameters are perpendicular). The area of each segment can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord from the area of the sector.\n\n1. **Area of the sector:**\n   The angle of each sector is 90 degrees, which is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the full circle. The area of the full circle is \\(\\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\\). Therefore, the area of one sector is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one sector} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16\\pi = 4\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of the triangle:**\n   The triangle formed by the radii and the chord is a right triangle with legs equal to the radius of the circle (4 units each). The area of this triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of one segment:**\n   The area of one segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one segment} = 4\\pi - 8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total area of the shaded region:**\n   Since there are two such segments in the shaded region, the total area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shaded area} = 2 \\times (4\\pi - 8) = 8\\pi - 16\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region is \\(8\\pi - 16\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8\\pi - 16}\n\\]"
