    "\nassistant > To find the area of a triangle given its vertices in the Cartesian coordinate plane, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.\n\nFor the given vertices \\((5, -2)\\), \\((10, 5)\\), and \\((5, 5)\\), we can substitute these values into the formula to find the area.
