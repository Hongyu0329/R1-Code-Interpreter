    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to find the area of triangle \\( \\triangle CEF \\) given that \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are midpoints of sides \\( \\overline{AC} \\) and \\( \\overline{AB} \\) respectively, and the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is 24 square units.\n\nSince \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are midpoints, \\( \\overline{EF} \\) is parallel to \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and \\( \\overline{EF} \\) is half the length of \\( \\overline{BC} \\). This makes \\( \\triangle CEF \\) similar to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with a similarity ratio of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThe area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of their corresponding side lengths. Therefore, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle CEF = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is 6 square units.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>."
