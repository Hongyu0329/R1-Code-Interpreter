    "To compute \\(\\tan 0^\\circ\\), we need to understand the definition and properties of the tangent function.\n\n1. **Definition of Tangent**: The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In terms of the unit circle, \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\\).\n\n2. **Values of Sine and Cosine at \\(0^\\circ\\)**:\n   - \\(\\sin 0^\\circ = 0\\)\n   - \\(\\cos 0^\\circ = 1\\)\n\n3. **Substitute into the Tangent Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\tan 0^\\circ = \\frac{\\sin 0^\\circ}{\\cos 0^\\circ} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The tangent of \\(0^\\circ\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
