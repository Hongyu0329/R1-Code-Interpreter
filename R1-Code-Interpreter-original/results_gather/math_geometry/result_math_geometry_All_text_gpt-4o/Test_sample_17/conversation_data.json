    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest side of the triangle given the side lengths and the perimeter. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a triangle with sides of lengths 7, \\(x+4\\), and \\(2x+1\\).\n   - The perimeter of the triangle is 36.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation for the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.\n   - Therefore, we have the equation: \n     \\[\n     7 + (x+4) + (2x+1) = 36\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\[\n     7 + x + 4 + 2x + 1 = 36\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3x + 12 = 36\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Subtract 12 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     3x = 24\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 3:\n     \\[\n     x = 8\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Lengths of the Sides:**\n   - Substitute \\(x = 8\\) back into the expressions for the side lengths:\n     - First side: 7\n     - Second side: \\(x + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12\\)\n     - Third side: \\(2x + 1 = 2(8) + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17\\)\n\n6. **Identify the Longest Side:**\n   - The side lengths are 7, 12, and 17.\n   - The longest side is 17.\n\n7. **Verify the Triangle Inequality:**\n   - For a set of three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n   - Check the inequalities:\n     - \\(7 + 12 > 17\\) which is \\(19 > 17\\) (True)\n     - \\(7 + 17 > 12\\) which is \\(24 > 12\\) (True)\n     - \\(12 + 17 > 7\\) which is \\(29 > 7\\) (True)\n   - All inequalities are satisfied, confirming that these lengths can form a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the length of the longest side of the triangle is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>"
