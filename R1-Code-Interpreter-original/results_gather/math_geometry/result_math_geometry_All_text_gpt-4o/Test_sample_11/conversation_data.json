    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the right triangle \\(DEF\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Triangle:**\n   - In a right triangle, one of the angles is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n   - The sum of the angles in any triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Given Information:**\n   - \\(\\sin D = \\frac{5}{13}\\)\n   - \\(\\sin E = 1\\)\n\n3. **Analyzing \\(\\sin E = 1\\):**\n   - The sine of an angle is \\(1\\) only when the angle is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n   - Therefore, angle \\(E\\) must be the right angle in triangle \\(DEF\\).\n\n4. **Determining the Angles:**\n   - Since \\(E\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\), angles \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) must be the other two angles of the triangle.\n   - The sum of angles \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) must be \\(90^\\circ\\) because \\(D + F + E = 180^\\circ\\) and \\(E = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n5. **Using \\(\\sin D = \\frac{5}{13}\\):**\n   - \\(\\sin D = \\frac{\\text{opposite side to } D}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\\).\n   - This implies that the opposite side to \\(D\\) is \\(5\\) and the hypotenuse is \\(13\\).\n\n6. **Finding \\(\\sin F\\):**\n   - Since \\(D + F = 90^\\circ\\), angle \\(F\\) is the complement of angle \\(D\\).\n   - In a right triangle, \\(\\sin F = \\cos D\\).\n\n7. **Calculating \\(\\cos D\\):**\n   - Using the Pythagorean identity: \\(\\sin^2 D + \\cos^2 D = 1\\).\n   - \\(\\sin^2 D = \\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{169}\\).\n   - \\(\\cos^2 D = 1 - \\frac{25}{169} = \\frac{144}{169}\\).\n   - \\(\\cos D = \\sqrt{\\frac{144}{169}} = \\frac{12}{13}\\).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\(\\sin F = \\cos D\\), we have \\(\\sin F = \\frac{12}{13}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{12}{13}\\)>>>\n"
