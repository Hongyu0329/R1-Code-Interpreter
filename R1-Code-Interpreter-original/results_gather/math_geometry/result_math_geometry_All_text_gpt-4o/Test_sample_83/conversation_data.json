    "To compute \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ\\), we need to consider the periodicity of the tangent function. The tangent function has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\), meaning that \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\tan(\\theta + 180^\\circ k)\\) for any integer \\(k\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Determine the Equivalent Angle within One Period:**\n   - We need to find an angle \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(0 \\leq \\theta < 180^\\circ\\) and \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ = \\tan \\theta\\).\n   - To do this, we calculate \\(3825^\\circ \\mod 180^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Perform the Modulo Operation:**\n   - Divide \\(3825\\) by \\(180\\) to find the remainder:\n     \\[\n     3825 \\div 180 = 21 \\text{ remainder } 45\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\(3825^\\circ \\equiv 45^\\circ \\pmod{180^\\circ}\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Tangent Function:**\n   - Now, we need to compute \\(\\tan 45^\\circ\\).\n   - It is a well-known trigonometric identity that \\(\\tan 45^\\circ = 1\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ = \\tan 45^\\circ\\), we have \\(\\tan 3825^\\circ = 1\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{<<<1>>>}}\n\\]"
