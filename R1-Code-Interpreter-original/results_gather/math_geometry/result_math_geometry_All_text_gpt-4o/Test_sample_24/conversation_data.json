    "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the smaller pyramid that is cut off by the plane parallel to the base of the original pyramid.\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: \n   - The original pyramid is a right square pyramid with a base edge of \\(8\\sqrt{2}\\) units and slant edges of 10 units.\n   - The plane cuts the pyramid parallel to the base, 3 units above the base.\n\n2. **Find the Height of the Original Pyramid**:\n   - The base is a square with side \\(8\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - The slant height (distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge) is 10 units.\n   - The half-diagonal of the base is \\(\\frac{8\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8\\).\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height \\(h\\), half-diagonal 8, and slant height 10:\n     \\[\n     h^2 + 8^2 = 10^2 \\implies h^2 + 64 = 100 \\implies h^2 = 36 \\implies h = 6\n     \\]\n   - The height of the original pyramid is 6 units.\n\n3. **Determine the Height of the Smaller Pyramid**:\n   - The plane is 3 units above the base, so the height of the smaller pyramid is \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) units.\n\n4. **Find the Side Length of the Smaller Pyramid's Base**:\n   - The smaller pyramid is similar to the original pyramid.\n   - The ratio of the heights is \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - Therefore, the side length of the smaller base is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Volume of the Smaller Pyramid**:\n   - The area of the smaller base is \\((4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32\\).\n   - The volume of a pyramid is given by \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}\\).\n   - Thus, the volume of the smaller pyramid is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3} \\times 32 \\times 3 = 32\n     \\]\n\nThe volume of the new pyramid that is cut off by the plane is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<32>>>."
