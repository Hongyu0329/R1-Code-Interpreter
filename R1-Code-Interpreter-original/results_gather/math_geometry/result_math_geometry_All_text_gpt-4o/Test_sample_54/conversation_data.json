    "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the space inside the sphere but outside the cylinder. We will do this by calculating the volume of the sphere and subtracting the volume of the cylinder from it.\n\n1. **Volume of the Sphere:**\n   - The formula for the volume of a sphere is \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\).\n   - Given the radius of the sphere is 5 units, the volume of the sphere is:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 125 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Dimensions of the Cylinder:**\n   - The cylinder is inscribed in the sphere, meaning the diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the cylinder.\n   - The base radius of the cylinder is given as 3 units.\n   - The height of the cylinder can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the sphere, the radius of the cylinder, and half the height of the cylinder.\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the height of the cylinder. The diagonal of the cylinder (which is the diameter of the sphere) is:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(2 \\times 3)^2 + h^2} = 10\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{36 + h^2} = 10\n     \\]\n   - Squaring both sides:\n     \\[\n     36 + h^2 = 100\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( h^2 \\):\n     \\[\n     h^2 = 64 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad h = 8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Volume of the Cylinder:**\n   - The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n   - With a base radius of 3 units and height of 8 units, the volume of the cylinder is:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 \\times 8 = 72 \\pi\n     \\]\n\n4. **Volume of the Space Inside the Sphere but Outside the Cylinder:**\n   - Subtract the volume of the cylinder from the volume of the sphere:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{space}} = V_{\\text{sphere}} - V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi - 72 \\pi\n     \\]\n   - To combine these, convert \\( 72 \\pi \\) to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n     \\[\n     72 \\pi = \\frac{216}{3} \\pi\n     \\]\n   - Subtract the fractions:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{space}} = \\left(\\frac{500}{3} - \\frac{216}{3}\\right) \\pi = \\frac{284}{3} \\pi\n     \\]\n\n5. **Finding \\( W \\):**\n   - The problem states that the volume of the space is \\( W\\pi \\), so:\n     \\[\n     W\\pi = \\frac{284}{3} \\pi\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( W = \\frac{284}{3} \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{284}{3}\\)>>>"
