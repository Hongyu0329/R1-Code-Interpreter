    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of the larger circle minus the areas of the two smaller circles.\n\n1. **Identify the radii of the circles:**\n   - The two smaller circles have radii of 2 and 3.\n   - The larger circle circumscribes both smaller circles.\n\n2. **Determine the distance between the centers of the smaller circles:**\n   - Since the circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n3. **Find the radius of the larger circle:**\n   - The larger circle circumscribes both smaller circles and is tangent to both. The center of the larger circle is equidistant from the centers of the two smaller circles.\n   - The distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of each smaller circle is the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle.\n   - Let \\(R\\) be the radius of the larger circle. The center of the larger circle is at the midpoint of the line segment joining the centers of the two smaller circles.\n   - The distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of the smaller circle with radius 3 is \\(R - 3\\).\n   - The distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of the smaller circle with radius 2 is \\(R - 2\\).\n   - Since the centers of the smaller circles are 5 units apart, the center of the larger circle is 2 units from the center of the circle with radius 3 and 3 units from the center of the circle with radius 2.\n   - Therefore, \\(R - 3 = 2\\) and \\(R - 2 = 3\\).\n   - Solving either equation gives \\(R = 5\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**\n   - The area of a circle is given by \\(\\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2\\).\n   - The area of the larger circle is \\(\\pi \\times 5^2 = 25\\pi\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the areas of the smaller circles:**\n   - The area of the circle with radius 3 is \\(\\pi \\times 3^2 = 9\\pi\\).\n   - The area of the circle with radius 2 is \\(\\pi \\times 2^2 = 4\\pi\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**\n   - The shaded region is the area of the larger circle minus the areas of the two smaller circles.\n   - Shaded area = \\(25\\pi - 9\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi\\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is \\(\\boxed{12\\pi}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<12\\pi>>>"
