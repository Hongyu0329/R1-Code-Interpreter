    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the radius of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds given that the chocolate from a larger hemisphere-shaped bowl is evenly distributed among them.\n\n1. **Understand the Volume of a Hemisphere:**\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a hemisphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Large Hemisphere:**\n   The large hemisphere has a radius of 1 foot. Therefore, its volume is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distribute the Volume Among Smaller Hemispheres:**\n   The total volume of chocolate is distributed evenly among 27 smaller hemispheres. Therefore, the volume of each smaller hemisphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{large}}}{27} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\pi}{27} = \\frac{2}{81} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relate the Volume to the Radius of Smaller Hemispheres:**\n   Let \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\) be the radius of each smaller hemisphere. The volume of each smaller hemisphere is also given by:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi (r_{\\text{small}})^3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set the Volumes Equal and Solve for \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\):**\n   Equating the two expressions for the volume of the smaller hemisphere, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\pi (r_{\\text{small}})^3 = \\frac{2}{81} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n   Cancel \\(\\pi\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} (r_{\\text{small}})^3 = \\frac{2}{81}\n   \\]\n\n   Divide both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   (r_{\\text{small}})^3 = \\frac{2}{81} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\):**\n   Taking the cube root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   r_{\\text{small}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the radius of each of the smaller molds is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) feet.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0.333>>>"
