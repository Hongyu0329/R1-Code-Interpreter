    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the volume of a right circular cone inscribed in a right prism to the volume of the prism itself.\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry:**\n   - The right prism is a rectangular prism with a square base.\n   - The cone is inscribed in the prism, meaning its base is a circle that fits perfectly within the square base of the prism.\n\n2. **Dimensions of the Prism:**\n   - Let the side length of the square base of the prism be \\( s \\).\n   - Let the height of the prism be \\( h \\).\n\n3. **Volume of the Prism:**\n   - The volume \\( V_{\\text{prism}} \\) of the prism is given by the area of the base times the height:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{prism}} = s^2 \\times h\n     \\]\n\n4. **Dimensions of the Cone:**\n   - The base of the cone is a circle inscribed in the square base of the prism.\n   - The diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, \\( s \\).\n   - Therefore, the radius \\( r \\) of the cone's base is \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\).\n   - The height of the cone is the same as the height of the prism, \\( h \\).\n\n5. **Volume of the Cone:**\n   - The volume \\( V_{\\text{cone}} \\) of the cone is given by:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( r = \\frac{s}{2} \\):\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\frac{s^2}{4} h = \\frac{1}{12} \\pi s^2 h\n     \\]\n\n6. **Ratio of the Volumes:**\n   - The ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cone}}}{V_{\\text{prism}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{12} \\pi s^2 h}{s^2 h}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the expression:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{12} \\pi s^2 h}{s^2 h} = \\frac{1}{12} \\pi\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<\\frac{\\pi}{12}>>>"
