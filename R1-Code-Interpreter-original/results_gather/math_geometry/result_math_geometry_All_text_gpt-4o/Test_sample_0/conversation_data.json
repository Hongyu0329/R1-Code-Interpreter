    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the original square ABCD:**\n   - The area of the square is given as 4 square units.\n   - The formula for the area of a square is \\( \\text{side length}^2 \\).\n   - Therefore, the side length of the square is \\( \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\) units.\n\n2. **Find the coordinates of the vertices of the original square:**\n   - The center of the square is at (8, -8).\n   - Since the top side of the square is horizontal, the square is aligned with the coordinate axes.\n   - The half-diagonal from the center to any vertex is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times \\text{side length} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 2 = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n   - The vertices of the square can be calculated as:\n     - Top-right vertex: \\( (8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7) \\)\n     - Top-left vertex: \\( (8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7) \\)\n     - Bottom-right vertex: \\( (8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9) \\)\n     - Bottom-left vertex: \\( (8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9) \\)\n\n3. **Dilate the square with respect to the origin (0,0) with a scale factor of 2:**\n   - The dilation formula is \\( (x, y) \\rightarrow (2x, 2y) \\).\n   - Applying this to each vertex:\n     - Top-right vertex: \\( (9, -7) \\rightarrow (18, -14) \\)\n     - Top-left vertex: \\( (7, -7) \\rightarrow (14, -14) \\)\n     - Bottom-right vertex: \\( (9, -9) \\rightarrow (18, -18) \\)\n     - Bottom-left vertex: \\( (7, -9) \\rightarrow (14, -18) \\)\n\n4. **Determine which vertex is farthest from the origin:**\n   - Calculate the distance from the origin for each dilated vertex using the distance formula \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\):\n     - Distance for (18, -14): \\( \\sqrt{18^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 196} = \\sqrt{520} \\)\n     - Distance for (14, -14): \\( \\sqrt{14^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 196} = \\sqrt{392} \\)\n     - Distance for (18, -18): \\( \\sqrt{18^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{324 + 324} = \\sqrt{648} \\)\n     - Distance for (14, -18): \\( \\sqrt{14^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 324} = \\sqrt{520} \\)\n   - The largest distance is \\( \\sqrt{648} \\), which corresponds to the vertex (18, -18).\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin are:\n\n<<<(18, -18)>>>"
