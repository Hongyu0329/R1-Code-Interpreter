    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Reflection Over the y-axis:**\n   - When a point \\((x, y)\\) is reflected over the y-axis, its x-coordinate changes sign, while the y-coordinate remains the same. Therefore, the reflection of a point \\((x, y)\\) over the y-axis is \\((-x, y)\\).\n\n2. **Find the Coordinates of \\(C'\\):**\n   - The original coordinates of point \\(C\\) are \\((-3, 2)\\).\n   - Reflecting \\(C\\) over the y-axis, we change the sign of the x-coordinate:\n     \\[\n     C' = (3, 2)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of Segment \\(CC'\\):**\n   - The length of a segment between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the distance formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n     \\]\n   - For points \\(C(-3, 2)\\) and \\(C'(3, 2)\\), the distance is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(3 - (-3))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(3 + 3)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{6^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The length of the segment from \\(C\\) to \\(C'\\) is 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
