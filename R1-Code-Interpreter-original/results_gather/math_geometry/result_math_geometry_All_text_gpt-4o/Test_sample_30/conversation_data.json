    "To find the area of a triangle given its vertices in a Cartesian coordinate plane, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.\n\nGiven vertices are \\((5, -2)\\), \\((10, 5)\\), and \\((5, 5)\\).\n\nLet's assign:\n- \\((x_1, y_1) = (5, -2)\\)\n- \\((x_2, y_2) = (10, 5)\\)\n- \\((x_3, y_3) = (5, 5)\\)\n\nSubstitute these into the formula:\n\n1. Calculate \\(x_1(y_2-y_3)\\):\n   \\[\n   5(5-5) = 5 \\times 0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(x_2(y_3-y_1)\\):\n   \\[\n   10(5 - (-2)) = 10 \\times 7 = 70\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\(x_3(y_1-y_2)\\):\n   \\[\n   5(-2 - 5) = 5 \\times (-7) = -35\n   \\]\n\nNow, substitute these values into the area formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 70 - 35 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 35 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 35 = 17.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the triangle is 17.5 square units.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<17.5>>>"
