    "To compute \\(\\sin 60^\\circ\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Unit Circle and Special Angles**: \n   - The angle \\(60^\\circ\\) is a special angle in trigonometry. It is one of the angles in an equilateral triangle, where each angle is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Use the Properties of a 30-60-90 Triangle**:\n   - A 30-60-90 triangle is a special right triangle where the angles are \\(30^\\circ\\), \\(60^\\circ\\), and \\(90^\\circ\\).\n   - The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio \\(1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2\\), where:\n     - The side opposite the \\(30^\\circ\\) angle is the shortest and is \\(1\\).\n     - The side opposite the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n     - The hypotenuse is \\(2\\).\n\n3. **Determine \\(\\sin 60^\\circ\\) Using the Triangle**:\n   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, \\(\\sin 60^\\circ\\) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle to the hypotenuse.\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{opposite side}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Verify Using the Unit Circle**:\n   - On the unit circle, the coordinates of the point corresponding to \\(60^\\circ\\) (or \\(\\pi/3\\) radians) are \\((\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\).\n   - The y-coordinate of this point gives the sine value, which is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both the 30-60-90 triangle and the unit circle confirm that \\(\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)>>>"
