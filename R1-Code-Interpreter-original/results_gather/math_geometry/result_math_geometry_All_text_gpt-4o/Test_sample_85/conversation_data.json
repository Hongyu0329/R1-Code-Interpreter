    "To determine the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to consider both the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular ends.\n\n1. **Identify the given dimensions:**\n   - Height (\\(h\\)) of the cylinder = 10\n   - Radius (\\(r\\)) of the cylinder = 3\n\n2. **Calculate the lateral surface area:**\n   - The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\\pi rh\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the given values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\\pi \\times 3 \\times 10 = 60\\pi\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the two circular ends:**\n   - The formula for the area of one circle is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of one end} = \\pi r^2\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the given radius:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of one end} = \\pi \\times 3^2 = 9\\pi\n     \\]\n   - Since there are two ends, the total area for both ends is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Area of both ends} = 2 \\times 9\\pi = 18\\pi\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total surface area:**\n   - The total surface area of the cylinder is the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the two ends:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Surface Area} = 60\\pi + 18\\pi = 78\\pi\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final answer:**\n   - The total surface area of the cylinder is \\(78\\pi\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<78\\pi>>>"
