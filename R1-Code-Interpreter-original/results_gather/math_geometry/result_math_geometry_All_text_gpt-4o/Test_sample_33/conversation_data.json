    "To find the volume of a rectangular box given the areas of its faces, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the box:**\n   - Let the dimensions of the box be \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n   - The areas of the faces are given as:\n     - \\( xy = 24 \\)\n     - \\( yz = 16 \\)\n     - \\( zx = 6 \\)\n\n2. **Express the volume in terms of the dimensions:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of the box is given by the product of its dimensions: \\( V = xyz \\).\n\n3. **Find the product of the face areas:**\n   - Multiply the equations for the areas of the faces:\n     \\[\n     (xy)(yz)(zx) = 24 \\times 16 \\times 6\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     (xyz)^2 = 24 \\times 16 \\times 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the product:**\n   - Compute the product:\n     \\[\n     24 \\times 16 = 384\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     384 \\times 6 = 2304\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( (xyz)^2 = 2304 \\).\n\n5. **Solve for the volume:**\n   - Take the square root of both sides to find \\( xyz \\):\n     \\[\n     xyz = \\sqrt{2304}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2304} = 48\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The volume of the rectangular box is \\( 48 \\) cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<48>>>"
