    "To find the degree measure of angle \\( \\angle LOQ \\) in the regular hexagon \\( LMNOPQ \\), we need to analyze the properties of a regular hexagon and the specific configuration of the points.\n\n1. **Properties of a Regular Hexagon:**\n   - A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles.\n   - Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is \\( 120^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Configuration:**\n   - The vertices of the hexagon are labeled in order: \\( L, M, N, O, P, Q \\).\n   - The hexagon is regular, so all sides are equal, and all interior angles are \\( 120^\\circ \\).\n\n3. **Identifying the Angle \\( \\angle LOQ \\):**\n   - The angle \\( \\angle LOQ \\) is formed by the lines \\( LO \\) and \\( OQ \\).\n   - In a regular hexagon, the diagonals that connect opposite vertices (like \\( L \\) to \\( O \\) and \\( O \\) to \\( Q \\)) are important.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Diagonals:**\n   - In a regular hexagon, the diagonals that connect two vertices with one vertex in between (like \\( L \\) to \\( O \\) and \\( O \\) to \\( Q \\)) form an equilateral triangle.\n   - This is because the central angle subtended by each side of the hexagon is \\( 60^\\circ \\), and the diagonals \\( LO \\) and \\( OQ \\) are equal in length to the sides of the hexagon.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\( LOQ \\) forms an equilateral triangle, each angle in this triangle is \\( 60^\\circ \\).\n\nTherefore, the degree measure of angle \\( \\angle LOQ \\) is \\( 60^\\circ \\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<60>>>."
