    "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the volume, \\( r \\) is the radius of the base, and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given values.**\n\n- The diameter of the cone is given as 10 cm.\n- The height of the cone is given as 6 cm.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the radius of the base.**\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) is half of the diameter. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the values into the volume formula.**\n\nNow that we have the radius and the height, we can substitute these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (5)^2 (6)\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume.**\n\nFirst, calculate \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 5^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( r^2 \\) and \\( h \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 25 \\times 6\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( 25 \\times 6 \\):\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 6 = 150\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 150\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the volume:\n\n\\[\nV = 50\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Express the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\).**\n\nThe volume of the cone is \\( 50\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<50\\pi>>>"
