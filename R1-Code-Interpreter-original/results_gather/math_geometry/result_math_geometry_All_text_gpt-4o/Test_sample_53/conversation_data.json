    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the \"WIN\" sector on the circular spinner. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a circular spinner with a radius of 10 cm.\n   - The probability of winning on one spin is given as \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Circle:**\n   - The formula for the area of a circle is \\(A = \\pi r^2\\).\n   - Here, the radius \\(r\\) is 10 cm.\n   - So, the total area of the circle is \\(A = \\pi \\times 10^2 = 100\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n\n3. **Relate Probability to Area:**\n   - The probability of landing on the \"WIN\" sector is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n   - This probability is the ratio of the area of the \"WIN\" sector to the total area of the circle.\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - Let \\(A_{\\text{WIN}}\\) be the area of the \"WIN\" sector.\n   - The probability equation is \\(\\frac{A_{\\text{WIN}}}{100\\pi} = \\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\n5. **Solve for the Area of the \"WIN\" Sector:**\n   - Multiply both sides of the equation by \\(100\\pi\\) to solve for \\(A_{\\text{WIN}}\\):\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{WIN}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100\\pi\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the expression:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{WIN}} = 40\\pi\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The area of the \"WIN\" sector is \\(40\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<40\\pi>>>"
