    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the region bounded by the arcs of circles. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - We have three arcs, each with a radius of 4 units and a central angle of 60 degrees.\n   - The arcs intersect at points of tangency, forming a region that resembles a Reuleaux triangle.\n\n2. **Area of a Sector**:\n   - The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\times \\pi r^2\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the central angle in degrees and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n   - For each arc, \\(\\theta = 60^\\circ\\) and \\(r = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, the area of one sector is: \\(\\frac{60}{360} \\times \\pi \\times 4^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\pi \\times 16 = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\).\n\n3. **Total Area of Three Sectors**:\n   - Since there are three identical sectors, the total area of the sectors is: \\(3 \\times \\frac{8\\pi}{3} = 8\\pi\\).\n\n4. **Area of the Equilateral Triangle**:\n   - The region formed by the intersection of the arcs is an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the radius of the circles, which is 4 units.\n   - The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\\).\n   - For our triangle, \\(s = 4\\), so the area is: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 4^2 = 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n5. **Area of the Region**:\n   - The area of the region bounded by the arcs is the total area of the sectors minus the area of the equilateral triangle.\n   - Therefore, the area of the region is: \\(8\\pi - 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n6. **Expressing in the Form \\(a\\sqrt{b} + c\\pi\\)**:\n   - The area is already in the form \\(a\\sqrt{b} + c\\pi\\), where \\(a = -4\\), \\(b = 3\\), and \\(c = 8\\).\n\n7. **Calculating \\(a + b + c\\)**:\n   - \\(a + b + c = -4 + 3 + 8 = 7\\).\n\nThus, the value of \\(a + b + c\\) is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
