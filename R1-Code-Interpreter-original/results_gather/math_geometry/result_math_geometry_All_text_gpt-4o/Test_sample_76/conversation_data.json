    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of an equilateral triangle given the area of its inscribed circle. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the relationship between the circle and the triangle:**\n   - The circle is inscribed in the equilateral triangle, meaning it is tangent to each side of the triangle.\n   - The center of the circle, O, is also the centroid and the incenter of the equilateral triangle.\n\n2. **Given information:**\n   - The area of the circle is \\(4\\pi\\) square centimeters.\n   - The formula for the area of a circle is \\(\\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n3. **Find the radius of the circle:**\n   - Set the area of the circle equal to \\(4\\pi\\): \\(\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi\\).\n   - Divide both sides by \\(\\pi\\): \\(r^2 = 4\\).\n   - Take the square root of both sides: \\(r = 2\\).\n\n4. **Relate the radius of the circle to the side length of the triangle:**\n   - For an equilateral triangle, the radius \\(r\\) of the inscribed circle is given by the formula \\(r = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length of the triangle.\n   - Substitute \\(r = 2\\) into the formula: \\(2 = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\).\n\n5. **Solve for the side length \\(s\\) of the triangle:**\n   - Multiply both sides by 6: \\(12 = s \\sqrt{3}\\).\n   - Divide both sides by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\): \\(s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n   - Rationalize the denominator: \\(s = \\frac{12 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:**\n   - The formula for the area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is \\(A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\\).\n   - Substitute \\(s = 4\\sqrt{3}\\) into the formula: \n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (4\\sqrt{3})^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplify: \n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 16 \\times 3\n     \\]\n   - Calculate: \n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 48 = 12\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is \\(12\\sqrt{3}\\) square centimeters.\n\nFinal answer: <<<12\\sqrt{3}>>>"
