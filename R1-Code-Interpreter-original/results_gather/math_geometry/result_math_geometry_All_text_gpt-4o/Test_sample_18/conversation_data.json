    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the shaded region in the diagram. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Diagram:**\n   - The circle has a radius of 4, so its diameter is \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n   - \\(PQ\\) and \\(RS\\) are diameters of the circle and are perpendicular to each other. This means they intersect at the center of the circle, dividing the circle into four equal quadrants.\n\n2. **Identifying the Shaded Region:**\n   - The shaded region consists of two parts: two quarter-circle sectors and a square.\n   - The square is formed by the intersection of the diameters, and its vertices are the midpoints of the circle's quadrants.\n\n3. **Calculating the Area of the Square:**\n   - The side length of the square is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 4.\n   - Therefore, the area of the square is \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Quarter-Circle Sectors:**\n   - Each quarter-circle sector has a radius of 4.\n   - The area of a full circle with radius 4 is \\(\\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\\).\n   - The area of one quarter-circle is \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 16\\pi = 4\\pi\\).\n   - There are two such quarter-circle sectors in the shaded region, so their total area is \\(2 \\times 4\\pi = 8\\pi\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Total Area of the Shaded Region:**\n   - The shaded region is the area of the square minus the area of the two quarter-circle sectors.\n   - Total shaded area = Area of square - Area of two quarter-circle sectors\n   - Total shaded area = \\(16 - 8\\pi\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The area of the shaded region is \\(16 - 8\\pi\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16 - 8\\pi>>>"
