    "To find the area of the shaded region in the regular hexagon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: The problem involves a regular hexagon with a side length of 10 cm. The shaded region is a quadrilateral formed by connecting alternate vertices of the hexagon, specifically B, C, E, and F.\n\n2. **Identify the Shape of the Shaded Region**: The shaded region is a quadrilateral. In a regular hexagon, connecting alternate vertices forms a parallelogram. In this case, B, C, E, and F form a parallelogram.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Regular Hexagon**: \n   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.\n   - The area of one equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n     \\]\n   - For a side length of 10 cm, the area of one triangle is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 10^2 = 25\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total area of the hexagon is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 25\\sqrt{3} = 150\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram**:\n   - The parallelogram B, C, E, F is formed by two of the equilateral triangles of the hexagon.\n   - Since the hexagon is regular, the parallelogram is exactly half of the hexagon.\n   - Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is half of the hexagon's area:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{150\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 75\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The area of the shaded region, which is the parallelogram B, C, E, F, is \\( 75\\sqrt{3} \\) square centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<75âˆš3>>>"
