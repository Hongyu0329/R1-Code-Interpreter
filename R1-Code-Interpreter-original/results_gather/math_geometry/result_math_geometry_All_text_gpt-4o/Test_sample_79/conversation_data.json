    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the volume of a cylinder changes when its dimensions are altered. The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\n**Step 1: Original Volume**\n\nLet's denote the original radius as \\( r \\) and the original height as \\( h \\). The original volume \\( V_{\\text{original}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{original}} = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\n**Step 2: New Dimensions**\n\n- The height is doubled, so the new height \\( h_{\\text{new}} = 2h \\).\n- The radius is increased by 200%, which means the new radius \\( r_{\\text{new}} = r + 2r = 3r \\).\n\n**Step 3: New Volume**\n\nThe new volume \\( V_{\\text{new}} \\) with the new dimensions is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{new}})^2 h_{\\text{new}} \\]\n\nSubstitute the new dimensions:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (3r)^2 (2h) \\]\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi \\times 9r^2 \\times 2h \\]\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = 18\\pi r^2 h \\]\n\n**Step 4: Factor of Increase**\n\nThe factor \\( X \\) by which the volume is multiplied is the ratio of the new volume to the original volume:\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{V_{\\text{new}}}{V_{\\text{original}}} \\]\n\nSubstitute the expressions for \\( V_{\\text{new}} \\) and \\( V_{\\text{original}} \\):\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{18\\pi r^2 h}{\\pi r^2 h} \\]\n\n\\[ X = 18 \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cylinder is multiplied by a factor of 18.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
