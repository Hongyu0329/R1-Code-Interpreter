    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationship between the arcs and the areas of the two concentric circles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have two concentric circles with a common center P.\n   - The smaller circle has an arc formed by a 45-degree angle at P.\n   - The larger circle has an arc formed by a 36-degree angle at P.\n   - The lengths of these arcs are equal.\n\n2. **Arc Length Formula:**\n   - The length of an arc is given by the formula: \\( L = \\theta \\times r \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle in radians and \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n   - To convert degrees to radians, use the conversion: \\( \\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equations:**\n   - For the smaller circle: \\( L_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{45 \\times \\pi}{180} \\times r_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\times r_{\\text{small}} \\).\n   - For the larger circle: \\( L_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{36 \\times \\pi}{180} \\times r_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\times r_{\\text{large}} \\).\n\n4. **Equating the Arc Lengths:**\n   - Since the arc lengths are equal: \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\times r_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\times r_{\\text{large}} \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get: \\( \\frac{r_{\\text{small}}}{r_{\\text{large}}} = \\frac{4}{5} \\).\n\n5. **Area of a Circle:**\n   - The area of a circle is given by \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - Therefore, the area of the smaller circle is \\( A_{\\text{small}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{small}})^2 \\).\n   - The area of the larger circle is \\( A_{\\text{large}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{large}})^2 \\).\n\n6. **Finding the Ratio of the Areas:**\n   - The ratio of the areas is: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{A_{\\text{small}}}{A_{\\text{large}}} = \\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{small}})^2}{\\pi (r_{\\text{large}})^2} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{small}}}{r_{\\text{large}}}\\right)^2\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the ratio of the radii: \n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{small}}}{r_{\\text{large}}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle is \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<16/25>>>"
