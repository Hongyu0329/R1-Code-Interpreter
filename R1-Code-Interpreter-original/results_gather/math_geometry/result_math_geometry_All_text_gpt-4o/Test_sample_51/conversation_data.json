    "To solve this problem, we need to find the y-coordinate of the third vertex of an equilateral triangle, given that two vertices are at \\((0,5)\\) and \\((8,5)\\), and the third vertex is in the first quadrant.\n\n1. **Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle:**\n   - All sides are equal in length.\n   - The angles between any two sides are \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the side length:**\n   - The distance between the points \\((0,5)\\) and \\((8,5)\\) is the length of one side of the triangle.\n   - Since both points have the same y-coordinate, the distance is simply the difference in x-coordinates: \\(8 - 0 = 8\\).\n\n3. **Determine the possible positions for the third vertex:**\n   - The third vertex must be at a distance of 8 units from both \\((0,5)\\) and \\((8,5)\\).\n   - The third vertex is in the first quadrant, meaning both its x and y coordinates are positive.\n\n4. **Use the distance formula:**\n   - Let the third vertex be \\((x, y)\\).\n   - The distance from \\((0,5)\\) to \\((x, y)\\) is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - 5)^2} = 8\\).\n   - The distance from \\((8,5)\\) to \\((x, y)\\) is \\(\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 5)^2} = 8\\).\n\n5. **Set up the equations:**\n   - From \\((0,5)\\): \\(x^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 64\\).\n   - From \\((8,5)\\): \\((x - 8)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 64\\).\n\n6. **Simplify and solve the equations:**\n   - Expand the second equation: \\((x - 8)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 64\\) becomes \\(x^2 - 16x + 64 + (y - 5)^2 = 64\\).\n   - Subtract the first equation from the expanded second equation:\n     \\[\n     (x^2 - 16x + 64 + (y - 5)^2) - (x^2 + (y - 5)^2) = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -16x + 64 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 4\n     \\]\n\n7. **Substitute \\(x = 4\\) back into one of the original equations:**\n   - Use \\(x^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 64\\):\n     \\[\n     4^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 64\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     16 + (y - 5)^2 = 64\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (y - 5)^2 = 48\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y - 5 = \\pm \\sqrt{48}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y - 5 = \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Determine the correct y-coordinate:**\n   - Since the third vertex is in the first quadrant, \\(y\\) must be positive.\n   - Therefore, \\(y - 5 = 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n   - Thus, \\(y = 5 + 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThe y-coordinate of the third vertex is \\(\\boxed{5 + 4\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<5 + 4\\sqrt{3>>>"
