    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the volumes of the pieces of the cone that are formed when it is sliced by planes parallel to its base. The cone is divided into four pieces of equal height, and we need to find the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece.\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry of the Cone:**\n   - A right circular cone is sliced into four pieces by planes parallel to its base.\n   - The height of the cone is divided into four equal parts, so each piece has the same height.\n\n2. **Volume of a Cone:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a cone is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( r \\) is the radius of the base, and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone.\n\n3. **Volumes of the Frustums:**\n   - Each piece is a frustum of a cone, except the topmost piece, which is a smaller cone.\n   - The volume of a frustum of a cone with radii \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) and height \\( h \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi h (r_1^2 + r_1 r_2 + r_2^2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Radii:**\n   - The cone is divided into four sections, so the height of each section is \\( \\frac{H}{4} \\), where \\( H \\) is the total height of the cone.\n   - The radii of the sections are proportional to their heights from the apex of the cone. If the original cone has a base radius \\( R \\), the radii of the sections from top to bottom are:\n     - Topmost section (small cone): \\( \\frac{R}{4} \\)\n     - Second section: \\( \\frac{R}{2} \\)\n     - Third section: \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\)\n     - Bottom section (largest base): \\( R \\)\n\n5. **Calculate the Volumes:**\n   - **Largest Piece (Bottom Frustum):**\n     - Radii: \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\) and \\( R \\)\n     - Volume: \n       \\[\n       V_{\\text{largest}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{H}{4}\\right) \\left(\\left(\\frac{3R}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3R}{4}\\right)R + R^2\\right)\n       \\]\n\n   - **Second-Largest Piece (Second Frustum from Bottom):**\n     - Radii: \\( \\frac{R}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{3R}{4} \\)\n     - Volume:\n       \\[\n       V_{\\text{second-largest}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{H}{4}\\right) \\left(\\left(\\frac{R}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{R}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3R}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3R}{4}\\right)^2\\right)\n       \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the Volumes:**\n   - **Largest Piece:**\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{largest}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{H}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{9R^2}{16} + \\frac{3R^2}{4} + R^2\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{H}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{37R^2}{16}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{37}{192} \\pi HR^2\n     \\]\n\n   - **Second-Largest Piece:**\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{second-largest}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{H}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R^2}{4} + \\frac{3R^2}{8} + \\frac{9R^2}{16}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{H}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{19R^2}{16}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{19}{192} \\pi HR^2\n     \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the Ratio:**\n   - The ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the largest piece is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{second-largest}}}{V_{\\text{largest}}} = \\frac{\\frac{19}{192} \\pi HR^2}{\\frac{37}{192} \\pi HR^2} = \\frac{19}{37}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece is:\n\n<<<19/37>>>"
