    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which cone can be formed from a sector of a circle with a central angle of \\(252^\\circ\\) and a radius of 10. The sector is used to form the lateral surface of the cone by aligning the two straight sides.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate the Arc Length of the Sector:**\n   - The formula for the arc length \\(L\\) of a sector with central angle \\(\\theta\\) (in degrees) and radius \\(r\\) is:\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\times 2\\pi r\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the given values:\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{252}{360} \\times 2\\pi \\times 10 = \\frac{7}{10} \\times 20\\pi = 14\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Base Circumference of the Cone:**\n   - The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.\n   - Therefore, the circumference \\(C\\) of the base of the cone is \\(14\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Base Radius of the Cone:**\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle is \\(C = 2\\pi r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n   - Solving for \\(r\\) using the base circumference:\n     \\[\n     2\\pi r = 14\\pi \\implies r = 7\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Slant Height of the Cone:**\n   - The slant height of the cone is the same as the radius of the original circle from which the sector was cut, which is 10.\n\n5. **Match the Calculated Values with the Given Options:**\n   - We have determined that the base radius is 7 and the slant height is 10.\n   - Among the given options, we need to find the one that matches these values.\n\n### Matching with Options:\n\n- **Option A:** base radius = 6, slant = 10\n- **Option B:** base radius = 6, height = 10\n- **Option C:** base radius = 7, slant = 10\n- **Option D:** base radius = 7, height = 10\n- **Option E:** base radius = 8, slant = 10\n\nThe correct option is **Option C**, which has a base radius of 7 and a slant height of 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
