    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the volume of the cube to the volume of the square-based pyramid and solve for the height \\( h \\).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the cube.**\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cube with edge length \\( a \\) is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = a^3 \\]\n\nGiven that the edge length of the cube is 4 units:\n\\[ V_{\\text{cube}} = 4^3 = 64 \\text{ cubic units} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Write the formula for the volume of the square-based pyramid.**\n\nThe formula for the volume of a square-based pyramid with base edge length \\( b \\) and height \\( h \\) is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} b^2 h \\]\n\nGiven that the base edge length of the pyramid is 8 units:\n\\[ V_{\\text{pyramid}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 8^2 \\times h = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 64 \\times h = \\frac{64}{3} h \\]\n\n**Step 3: Set the volumes equal to each other and solve for \\( h \\).**\n\nSince the volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the pyramid:\n\\[ 64 = \\frac{64}{3} h \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( h \\).**\n\nTo isolate \\( h \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ 64 \\times 3 = 64h \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 192 = 64h \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 64 to solve for \\( h \\):\n\\[ h = \\frac{192}{64} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the height \\( h \\) of the pyramid is 3 units.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<3>>>"
