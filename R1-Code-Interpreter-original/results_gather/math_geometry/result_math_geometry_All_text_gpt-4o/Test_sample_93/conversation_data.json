    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere in which a rectangular box \\( P \\) is inscribed. We are given the surface area of the box and the sum of the lengths of its edges.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box \\( P \\) as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n1. **Surface Area of the Box:**\n   The surface area of the box is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   2(ab + bc + ca) = 384\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   ab + bc + ca = 192\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of the Edges:**\n   The sum of the lengths of the 12 edges of the box is:\n   \\[\n   4(a + b + c) = 112\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Diagonal of the Box:**\n   Since the box is inscribed in the sphere, the diagonal of the box is equal to the diameter of the sphere. The diagonal \\( d \\) of the box is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\n   \\]\n   The diameter of the sphere is \\( 2r \\), so:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 2r\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relating the Equations:**\n   We have two equations:\n   \\[\n   ab + bc + ca = 192\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = 28\n   \\]\n\n   We can use the identity:\n   \\[\n   (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   28^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2 \\times 192\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   784 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 384\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 400\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Radius \\( r \\):**\n   Since the diagonal of the box is equal to the diameter of the sphere:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 2r\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{400} = 2r\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   20 = 2r\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the sphere is \\( r = 10 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<10>>>"
