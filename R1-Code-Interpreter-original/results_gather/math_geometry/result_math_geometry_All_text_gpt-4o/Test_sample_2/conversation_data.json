    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the isosceles triangle \\(\\Delta ABC\\) and the angle \\(\\angle CBD\\).\n\n1. **Identify the Triangle Properties:**\n   - \\(\\Delta ABC\\) is isosceles with \\(AC = BC\\).\n   - The angle at the vertex \\(C\\) is given as \\(m\\angle C = 40^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Other Angles in \\(\\Delta ABC\\):**\n   - Since \\(\\Delta ABC\\) is isosceles with \\(AC = BC\\), the base angles \\(\\angle A\\) and \\(\\angle B\\) are equal.\n   - The sum of angles in any triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(m\\angle A + m\\angle B + m\\angle C = 180^\\circ\\).\n   - Substituting the known value, \\(m\\angle A + m\\angle B + 40^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n   - Since \\(\\angle A = \\angle B\\), let \\(m\\angle A = m\\angle B = x\\).\n   - Then, \\(x + x + 40^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n   - Simplifying, \\(2x + 40^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n   - Solving for \\(x\\), we get \\(2x = 140^\\circ\\), so \\(x = 70^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Determine \\(m\\angle CBD\\):**\n   - We need to find \\(m\\angle CBD\\).\n   - Since \\(m\\angle B = 70^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle CBD\\) is part of \\(\\angle B\\), we need to consider the geometry of the problem.\n   - The problem does not provide explicit information about point \\(D\\) or its relation to the triangle, but typically in such problems, \\(D\\) is on the extension of \\(AB\\) or \\(BC\\).\n   - If \\(D\\) is on the extension of \\(BC\\), then \\(\\angle CBD\\) would be an exterior angle to \\(\\Delta ABC\\) at vertex \\(B\\).\n   - The exterior angle \\(\\angle CBD\\) would be equal to the sum of the non-adjacent interior angles, which are \\(\\angle A\\) and \\(\\angle C\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(m\\angle CBD = m\\angle A + m\\angle C = 70^\\circ + 40^\\circ = 110^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, the number of degrees in \\(m\\angle CBD\\) is \\(\\boxed{110^\\circ}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<110>>>"
