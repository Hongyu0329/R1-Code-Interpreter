    "To find the total volume of snow Kadin uses to make the snowman, we need to calculate the volume of each spherical snowball and then sum them up. The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the volume for each snowball:\n\n1. **Snowball with radius 2 inches:**\n\n   \\[\n   V_1 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (2)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 8 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Snowball with radius 3 inches:**\n\n   \\[\n   V_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 27 = 36 \\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Snowball with radius 5 inches:**\n\n   \\[\n   V_3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 125 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the volumes of the three snowballs to find the total volume:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi + 36 \\pi + \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\nTo add these, we first convert \\( 36 \\pi \\) to a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n\n\\[\n36 \\pi = \\frac{108}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\nNow, add the fractions:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi + \\frac{108}{3} \\pi + \\frac{500}{3} \\pi = \\frac{32 + 108 + 500}{3} \\pi = \\frac{640}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\nThus, the total volume of snow Kadin uses is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{640}{3} \\pi}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\frac{640}{3} \\pi>>>"
