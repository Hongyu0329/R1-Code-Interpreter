    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical barrel and the hemispherical bucket, and then determine how many times the bucket needs to be filled to fill the barrel.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the cylindrical barrel.**\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the cylinder,\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nFor the barrel:\n- \\( r = 10 \\) inches,\n- \\( h = 15 \\) inches.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\\[ V_{\\text{barrel}} = \\pi \\times 10^2 \\times 15 = 1500\\pi \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of the hemispherical bucket.**\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nSince the bucket is a hemisphere (half of a sphere), its volume is half of the sphere's volume:\n\\[ V_{\\text{hemisphere}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nFor the bucket:\n- \\( r = 10 \\) inches.\n\nSubstitute this value into the formula:\n\\[ V_{\\text{bucket}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi \\times 10^3 = \\frac{2000}{3} \\pi \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of trips required.**\n\nTo find the number of trips, divide the volume of the barrel by the volume of the bucket:\n\\[ \\text{Number of trips} = \\frac{V_{\\text{barrel}}}{V_{\\text{bucket}}} = \\frac{1500\\pi}{\\frac{2000}{3}\\pi} \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[ \\text{Number of trips} = \\frac{1500 \\times 3}{2000} = \\frac{4500}{2000} = 2.25 \\]\n\nSince Brad cannot make a fraction of a trip, he must make 3 full trips to fill the barrel completely.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBrad must make 3 trips to the well to fill the barrel.\n\n<<<3>>>"
