    "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - We have a right triangle with one side of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches.\n   - A second triangle is similar to the first triangle and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches.\n\n2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side of the first triangle:**\n   - The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n   - For the first triangle, we have one side \\(a = 21\\) and hypotenuse \\(c = 29\\).\n   - Plug these values into the Pythagorean theorem: \\(21^2 + b^2 = 29^2\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(441 + b^2 = 841\\).\n   - Solve for \\(b^2\\): \\(b^2 = 841 - 441 = 400\\).\n   - Find \\(b\\): \\(b = \\sqrt{400} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Determine the scale factor between the two triangles:**\n   - The triangles are similar, so their corresponding sides are proportional.\n   - The hypotenuse of the first triangle is 29 inches, and the hypotenuse of the second triangle is 87 inches.\n   - The scale factor is the ratio of the hypotenuses: \\(\\frac{87}{29}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the shortest side of the second triangle:**\n   - The shortest side of the first triangle is 20 inches.\n   - Use the scale factor to find the corresponding side in the second triangle: \\(20 \\times \\frac{87}{29}\\).\n   - Calculate: \\(20 \\times 3 = 60\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The length of the shortest side of the second triangle is 60 inches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<60>>>"
