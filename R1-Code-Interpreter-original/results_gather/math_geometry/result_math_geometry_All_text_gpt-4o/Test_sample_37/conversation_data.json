    "To solve the problem of finding how many different isosceles triangles have integer side lengths and a perimeter of 23, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of an isosceles triangle**: An isosceles triangle has at least two sides that are equal in length. Let's denote the equal sides as \\( a \\) and the base as \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the perimeter**: The perimeter of the triangle is given by the sum of its sides. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   2a + b = 23\n   \\]\n   From this equation, we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   b = 23 - 2a\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the triangle inequality**: For any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. For an isosceles triangle with sides \\( a, a, \\) and \\( b \\), the inequalities are:\n   - \\( a + a > b \\) or \\( 2a > b \\)\n   - \\( a + b > a \\) or \\( b > 0 \\)\n   - \\( a + b > a \\) or \\( b > 0 \\) (this is the same as the previous inequality)\n\n4. **Substitute \\( b = 23 - 2a \\) into the inequalities**:\n   - From \\( 2a > b \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     2a > 23 - 2a\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     4a > 23\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a > 5.75\n     \\]\n     Since \\( a \\) must be an integer, \\( a \\geq 6 \\).\n\n   - From \\( b > 0 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     23 - 2a > 0\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     23 > 2a\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a < 11.5\n     \\]\n     Since \\( a \\) must be an integer, \\( a \\leq 11 \\).\n\n5. **Determine the possible integer values for \\( a \\)**: From the inequalities \\( a \\geq 6 \\) and \\( a \\leq 11 \\), the possible integer values for \\( a \\) are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\n6. **Calculate \\( b \\) for each possible \\( a \\)**:\n   - If \\( a = 6 \\), then \\( b = 23 - 2 \\times 6 = 11 \\).\n   - If \\( a = 7 \\), then \\( b = 23 - 2 \\times 7 = 9 \\).\n   - If \\( a = 8 \\), then \\( b = 23 - 2 \\times 8 = 7 \\).\n   - If \\( a = 9 \\), then \\( b = 23 - 2 \\times 9 = 5 \\).\n   - If \\( a = 10 \\), then \\( b = 23 - 2 \\times 10 = 3 \\).\n   - If \\( a = 11 \\), then \\( b = 23 - 2 \\times 11 = 1 \\).\n\n7. **Verify the triangle inequality for each case**: \n   - For \\( a = 6, b = 11 \\): \\( 2a = 12 > 11 \\) (valid)\n   - For \\( a = 7, b = 9 \\): \\( 2a = 14 > 9 \\) (valid)\n   - For \\( a = 8, b = 7 \\): \\( 2a = 16 > 7 \\) (valid)\n   - For \\( a = 9, b = 5 \\): \\( 2a = 18 > 5 \\) (valid)\n   - For \\( a = 10, b = 3 \\): \\( 2a = 20 > 3 \\) (valid)\n   - For \\( a = 11, b = 1 \\): \\( 2a = 22 > 1 \\) (valid)\n\nAll these combinations satisfy the triangle inequality, so they are valid isosceles triangles.\n\n8. **Count the number of valid triangles**: There are 6 valid combinations.\n\nTherefore, the number of different isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 23 is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
