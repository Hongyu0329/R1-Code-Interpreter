    "To find the area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given figure and the information provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Figure:**\n   - The figure consists of two rectangles. The smaller rectangle is on the left with dimensions 3 cm by 3 cm, and the larger rectangle is on the right with dimensions 9 cm by 9 cm.\n   - The shaded region is a triangle within the larger rectangle.\n\n2. **Identifying the Shaded Region:**\n   - The shaded region is a triangle with vertices at (3, 9), (12, 9), and (3, 9/4).\n   - The base of the triangle is along the line from (3, 9) to (12, 9), which is 9 cm long.\n   - The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from the line y = 9 to the point (3, 9/4).\n\n3. **Calculating the Height:**\n   - The y-coordinate of the point (3, 9/4) is 9/4 cm.\n   - The height of the triangle is the difference between the y-coordinate of the line y = 9 and the y-coordinate of the point (3, 9/4).\n   - Height = 9 - 9/4 = 36/4 - 9/4 = 27/4 cm.\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Triangle:**\n   - The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = 1/2 * base * height.\n   - Base = 9 cm, Height = 27/4 cm.\n   - Area = 1/2 * 9 * (27/4) = 243/8 cm².\n\n5. **Rounding the Area:**\n   - Convert 243/8 to a decimal: 243/8 = 30.375 cm².\n   - Round 30.375 to the nearest square centimeter: 30 cm².\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is:\n\n<<<30>>>"
