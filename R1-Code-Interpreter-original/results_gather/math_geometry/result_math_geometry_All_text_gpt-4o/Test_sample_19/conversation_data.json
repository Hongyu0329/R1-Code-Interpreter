    "To determine the number of diagonals in a cube, we need to consider the different types of line segments that can be formed by joining the vertices of the cube. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges of a Cube**: \n   - A cube has 8 vertices.\n   - A cube has 12 edges, each connecting two adjacent vertices.\n\n2. **Types of Segments**:\n   - **Edges**: These are the segments that connect two adjacent vertices. There are 12 edges in a cube.\n   - **Face Diagonals**: These are the segments that connect two opposite vertices on the same face of the cube. Each face of the cube is a square, and a square has 2 diagonals. Since a cube has 6 faces, there are \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) face diagonals.\n   - **Space Diagonals**: These are the segments that connect two vertices that are not on the same face and are not adjacent. These diagonals pass through the interior of the cube.\n\n3. **Counting Space Diagonals**:\n   - Each vertex of the cube is connected to 3 adjacent vertices (forming edges) and 3 vertices on the same face (forming face diagonals).\n   - The remaining vertices are the ones that form space diagonals with the given vertex.\n   - For each vertex, there are 8 vertices in total, minus 1 for itself, minus 3 for adjacent vertices, minus 3 for face diagonals, leaving 1 vertex for the space diagonal.\n   - Since there are 8 vertices, and each vertex can form 1 space diagonal, there are \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\) space diagonals in total.\n\n4. **Total Number of Diagonals**:\n   - The total number of diagonals in the cube is the sum of the face diagonals and the space diagonals.\n   - Total diagonals = Face diagonals + Space diagonals = 12 + 8 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the total number of diagonals in a cube is 20.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<20>>>."
