    "To find the volume of one piece of the pizza, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Entire Pizza:**\n   - The pizza is a cylinder with a diameter of 12 inches and a thickness (height) of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) inch.\n   - The radius \\(r\\) of the pizza is half of the diameter, so \\(r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\) inches.\n   - The formula for the volume \\(V\\) of a cylinder is \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(h\\) is the height.\n   - Substitute the values into the formula: \n     \\[\n     V = \\pi (6)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\pi \\times 36 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 12\\pi\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the volume of the entire pizza is \\(12\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of One Piece:**\n   - The pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces.\n   - To find the volume of one piece, divide the total volume by the number of pieces:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume of one piece} = \\frac{12\\pi}{12} = \\pi\n     \\]\n\nThus, the volume of one piece of the pizza is \\(\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\pi>>>"
