    "To find the sum of the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a triangular prism, we need to analyze each component separately.\n\n1. **Vertices**: \n   - A triangular prism has two triangular bases. Each triangle has 3 vertices.\n   - Since there are two triangles, the total number of vertices from the triangles is \\(3 + 3 = 6\\).\n\n2. **Edges**:\n   - Each triangular base has 3 edges. With two bases, this gives \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) edges.\n   - Additionally, there are 3 edges connecting the corresponding vertices of the two triangular bases (one edge for each pair of corresponding vertices).\n   - Therefore, the total number of edges is \\(6 + 3 = 9\\).\n\n3. **Faces**:\n   - A triangular prism has 2 triangular faces (the bases).\n   - It also has 3 rectangular faces connecting the corresponding edges of the two triangular bases.\n   - Therefore, the total number of faces is \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\nNow, we sum the number of faces, edges, and vertices:\n- Vertices: 6\n- Edges: 9\n- Faces: 5\n\nThe sum is \\(6 + 9 + 5 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the number of faces, edges, and vertices of a triangular prism is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
