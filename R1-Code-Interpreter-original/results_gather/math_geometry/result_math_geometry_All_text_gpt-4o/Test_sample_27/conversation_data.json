    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the sphere inscribed in the right cone and express it in the form \\( a\\sqrt{c} - a \\). Then, we will determine the value of \\( a + c \\).\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: \n   - We have a right circular cone with base radius \\( R = 12 \\) cm and height \\( h = 24 \\) cm.\n   - A sphere is inscribed in this cone, meaning the sphere is tangent to the cone's base and sides.\n\n2. **Use the Formula for the Radius of the Inscribed Sphere**:\n   - The formula for the radius \\( r \\) of a sphere inscribed in a right circular cone with base radius \\( R \\) and height \\( h \\) is:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{R \\cdot h}{\\sqrt{R^2 + h^2} + R}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the Given Values**:\n   - Substitute \\( R = 12 \\) and \\( h = 24 \\) into the formula:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{12 \\cdot 24}{\\sqrt{12^2 + 24^2} + 12}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Denominator**:\n   - First, calculate \\( \\sqrt{12^2 + 24^2} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{12^2 + 24^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 576} = \\sqrt{720} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n     \\[\n     12\\sqrt{5} + 12\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression for \\( r \\)**:\n   - The expression for \\( r \\) becomes:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{288}{12\\sqrt{5} + 12}\n     \\]\n   - Factor out 12 from the denominator:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{288}{12(\\sqrt{5} + 1)} = \\frac{24}{\\sqrt{5} + 1}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Rationalize the Denominator**:\n   - Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{24(\\sqrt{5} - 1)}{(\\sqrt{5} + 1)(\\sqrt{5} - 1)} = \\frac{24(\\sqrt{5} - 1)}{5 - 1} = 6(\\sqrt{5} - 1)\n     \\]\n\n7. **Express \\( r \\) in the Form \\( a\\sqrt{c} - a \\)**:\n   - We have \\( r = 6\\sqrt{5} - 6 \\).\n   - Thus, \\( a = 6 \\) and \\( c = 5 \\).\n\n8. **Calculate \\( a + c \\)**:\n   - \\( a + c = 6 + 5 = 11 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<11>>>"
