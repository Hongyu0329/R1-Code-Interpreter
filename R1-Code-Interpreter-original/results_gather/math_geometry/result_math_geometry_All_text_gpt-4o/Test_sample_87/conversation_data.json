    "To find the ratio of the areas of triangles \\(ABC\\) and \\(DEF\\), we need to first determine the areas of each triangle. Both triangles are right triangles, as their side lengths satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Step 1: Verify that both triangles are right triangles.**\n\n- For triangle \\(ABC\\) with sides 5, 12, and 13:\n  \\[\n  5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2\n  \\]\n  Thus, triangle \\(ABC\\) is a right triangle with the hypotenuse being 13.\n\n- For triangle \\(DEF\\) with sides 8, 15, and 17:\n  \\[\n  8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289 = 17^2\n  \\]\n  Thus, triangle \\(DEF\\) is a right triangle with the hypotenuse being 17.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the area of each triangle.**\n\n- The area of a right triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n\n- For triangle \\(ABC\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 12 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30\n  \\]\n\n- For triangle \\(DEF\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of } \\triangle DEF = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 15 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 = 60\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the areas.**\n\n- The ratio of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) to the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC}{\\text{Area of } \\triangle DEF} = \\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) to the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\frac{1}{2}>>>"
