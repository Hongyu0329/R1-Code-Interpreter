    "To find the total surface area of a hemisphere given that the area of its base is \\(100\\pi\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the components of a hemisphere:**\n   - A hemisphere consists of a curved surface and a flat circular base.\n\n2. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The area of the base of the hemisphere is \\(100\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Relate the base area to the radius:**\n   - The base of the hemisphere is a circle with area given by the formula \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.\n   - We are given that the area of the base is \\(100\\pi\\), so we have:\n     \\[\n     \\pi r^2 = 100\\pi\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by \\(\\pi\\) to solve for \\(r^2\\):\n     \\[\n     r^2 = 100\n     \\]\n   - Take the square root of both sides to find \\(r\\):\n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the curved surface area of the hemisphere:**\n   - The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is \\(2\\pi r^2\\).\n   - Substitute \\(r = 10\\) into the formula:\n     \\[\n     2\\pi (10)^2 = 2\\pi \\times 100 = 200\\pi\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total surface area of the hemisphere:**\n   - The total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of the curved surface area and the base area.\n   - We have already calculated the curved surface area as \\(200\\pi\\) and the base area is given as \\(100\\pi\\).\n   - Therefore, the total surface area is:\n     \\[\n     200\\pi + 100\\pi = 300\\pi\n     \\]\n\n6. **Express the final answer:**\n   - The total surface area of the hemisphere is \\(300\\pi\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<300\\pi>>>"
