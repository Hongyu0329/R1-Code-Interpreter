    "To determine the sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\) such that the sticks of lengths 5 cm, 9 cm, and \\( n \\) cm can form a triangle, we need to apply the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 9 \\), and \\( c = n \\). The triangle inequalities are:\n\n1. \\( a + b > c \\) or \\( 5 + 9 > n \\)\n2. \\( a + c > b \\) or \\( 5 + n > 9 \\)\n3. \\( b + c > a \\) or \\( 9 + n > 5 \\)\n\nNow, let's solve each inequality:\n\n1. \\( 5 + 9 > n \\) simplifies to \\( 14 > n \\) or \\( n < 14 \\).\n2. \\( 5 + n > 9 \\) simplifies to \\( n > 4 \\).\n3. \\( 9 + n > 5 \\) simplifies to \\( n > -4 \\).\n\nThe third inequality \\( n > -4 \\) is always true for positive \\( n \\), so it doesn't further restrict \\( n \\).\n\nCombining the first two inequalities, we have:\n- \\( n < 14 \\)\n- \\( n > 4 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be a whole number such that \\( 5 \\leq n \\leq 13 \\).\n\nThe possible whole number values for \\( n \\) are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nTo find the sum of these values, we calculate:\n\\[ 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 \\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 5 \\), the last term \\( l = 13 \\), and the number of terms \\( n = 9 \\).\n\nThe sum \\( S \\) of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\\[ S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) \\]\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ S = \\frac{9}{2} \\times (5 + 13) = \\frac{9}{2} \\times 18 = 9 \\times 9 = 81 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible whole number values of \\( n \\) is 81.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<81>>>"
