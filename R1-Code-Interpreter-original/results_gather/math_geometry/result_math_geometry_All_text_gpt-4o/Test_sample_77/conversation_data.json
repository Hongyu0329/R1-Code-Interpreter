    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation and use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1. **Understand the Setup:**\n   - We have a right triangle formed by the pole, the ground, and the cable.\n   - The base of the triangle (distance from the base of the pole to where the cable touches the ground) is 3 meters.\n   - The height of the triangle is the height of the pole, which we need to find.\n   - The hypotenuse of the triangle is the cable.\n\n2. **Leah's Position:**\n   - Leah walks 2.5 meters from the base of the pole towards the point where the cable is attached to the ground.\n   - At this point, her head just touches the cable.\n   - Leah is 1.5 meters tall.\n\n3. **Form a Smaller Triangle:**\n   - When Leah is 2.5 meters from the base, she forms a smaller right triangle with the pole and the cable.\n   - The base of this smaller triangle is 2.5 meters.\n   - The height of this smaller triangle is the height of the pole minus Leah's height (since her head touches the cable).\n\n4. **Use Similar Triangles:**\n   - The smaller triangle formed by Leah and the cable is similar to the larger triangle formed by the pole and the cable.\n   - Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.\n\n5. **Set Up the Proportion:**\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the height of the pole.\n   - The height of the smaller triangle is \\( h - 1.5 \\).\n   - The base of the smaller triangle is 2.5 meters, and the base of the larger triangle is 3 meters.\n   - The proportion is: \\(\\frac{h - 1.5}{h} = \\frac{2.5}{3}\\).\n\n6. **Solve the Proportion:**\n   - Cross-multiply to solve for \\( h \\):\n     \\[\n     3(h - 1.5) = 2.5h\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3h - 4.5 = 2.5h\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3h - 2.5h = 4.5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     0.5h = 4.5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{4.5}{0.5} = 9\n     \\]\n\nThe height of the pole is 9 meters.\n\nFinal answer: <<<9>>>"
