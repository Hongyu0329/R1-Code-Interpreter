    "To find the volume of the right rectangular prism, we need to determine the dimensions of the prism. Let's denote the dimensions of the prism as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The areas of the three faces are given as:\n\n1. \\(ab = 24 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2\\)\n2. \\(bc = 32 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2\\)\n3. \\(ca = 48 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2\\)\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of the prism is given by the product of its dimensions: \\(V = abc\\).\n\nTo find \\(abc\\), we can multiply the three equations:\n\n\\[\n(ab)(bc)(ca) = (abc)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given areas:\n\n\\[\n(24)(32)(48) = (abc)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculate the product on the left side:\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 32 = 768\n\\]\n\\[\n768 \\times 48 = 36864\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n(abc)^2 = 36864\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(abc\\), take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nabc = \\sqrt{36864}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the square root:\n\n\\[\nabc = 192\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the prism is \\(192 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^3\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<192>>>"
