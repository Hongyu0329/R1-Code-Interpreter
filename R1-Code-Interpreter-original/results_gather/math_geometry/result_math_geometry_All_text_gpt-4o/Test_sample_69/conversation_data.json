    "To find the total area of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pyramid Structure**: \n   - The pyramid has a square base with each side measuring 6 units.\n   - It has four triangular lateral faces.\n   - Each lateral edge (the slant height of the triangles) measures 5 units.\n\n2. **Identify the Triangular Faces**:\n   - Each triangular face is an isosceles triangle with two sides (the lateral edges) measuring 5 units and the base measuring 6 units (the side of the square base).\n\n3. **Calculate the Height of One Triangular Face**:\n   - To find the area of one triangular face, we need the height of the triangle.\n   - The height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Consider the triangle formed by half of the base (3 units), the height (h), and the lateral edge (5 units).\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \n     \\[\n     h^2 + 3^2 = 5^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h^2 + 9 = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h^2 = 16\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h = 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of One Triangular Face**:\n   - The area \\(A\\) of a triangle is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - For one triangular face:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ square units}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Area of the Four Triangular Faces**:\n   - Since there are four identical triangular faces, the total area is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Area} = 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ square units}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total area of the four triangular faces of the pyramid is:\n\n<<<48>>>"
