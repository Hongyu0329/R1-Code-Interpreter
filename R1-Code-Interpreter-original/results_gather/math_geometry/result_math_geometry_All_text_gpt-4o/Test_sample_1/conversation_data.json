    "To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the areas of two polygons within a regular octagon. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Regular Octagon:**\n   - A regular octagon has all sides of equal length and all internal angles equal to \\(135^\\circ\\).\n   - The center of the octagon is equidistant from all vertices.\n\n2. **Identifying Points:**\n   - \\(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\\) are the vertices of the octagon.\n   - \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{BC}\\).\n   - \\(N\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{FG}\\).\n   - \\(O\\) is the center of the octagon.\n\n3. **Finding the Area of \\([ABMO]\\):**\n   - \\([ABMO]\\) is a quadrilateral.\n   - Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(\\overline{BC}\\), \\(BM = MC = \\frac{1}{2}BC\\).\n   - The area of \\([ABMO]\\) can be found by dividing it into triangles \\([ABO]\\) and \\([BMO]\\).\n\n4. **Finding the Area of \\([EDCMO]\\):**\n   - \\([EDCMO]\\) is a pentagon.\n   - It can be divided into triangles \\([EDO]\\), \\([DCO]\\), and \\([CMO]\\).\n\n5. **Using Symmetry and Regularity:**\n   - The regularity of the octagon implies symmetry, which can simplify calculations.\n   - The octagon can be divided into 8 isosceles triangles with the center \\(O\\) as a common vertex.\n   - The area of each of these triangles is equal.\n\n6. **Calculating Areas:**\n   - The area of the entire octagon can be calculated using the formula for the area of a regular polygon: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = 2(1+\\sqrt{2})s^2\n     \\]\n     where \\(s\\) is the side length.\n   - The area of each isosceles triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the total area.\n\n7. **Finding the Ratio:**\n   - Since \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are midpoints, the areas of triangles involving these points can be calculated using the properties of midpoints and symmetry.\n   - The ratio \\([ABMO]/[EDCMO]\\) can be determined by comparing the areas of the triangles and quadrilaterals formed.\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   - By symmetry and equal division, the area of \\([ABMO]\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the area of the octagon.\n   - The area of \\([EDCMO]\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) of the area of the octagon.\n   - Therefore, the ratio is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{[ABMO]}{[EDCMO]} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{3}{8}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
