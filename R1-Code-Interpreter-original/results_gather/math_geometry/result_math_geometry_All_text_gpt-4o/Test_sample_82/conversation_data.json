    "To solve this problem, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), where \\(a = 4\\) cm, \\(b = 9\\) cm, and \\(c\\) is the unknown side.\n\nThe triangle inequality theorem gives us three conditions:\n\n1. \\(a + b > c\\)\n2. \\(a + c > b\\)\n3. \\(b + c > a\\)\n\nLet's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1: \\(a + b > c\\)**\n   - Substitute the known values: \\(4 + 9 > c\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(13 > c\\)\n   - This implies \\(c < 13\\).\n\n2. **Condition 2: \\(a + c > b\\)**\n   - Substitute the known values: \\(4 + c > 9\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(c > 5\\).\n\n3. **Condition 3: \\(b + c > a\\)**\n   - Substitute the known values: \\(9 + c > 4\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(c > -5\\).\n   - This condition is always true since \\(c\\) is a positive length.\n\nFrom conditions 1 and 2, we have:\n- \\(c < 13\\)\n- \\(c > 5\\)\n\nThe greatest integer value for \\(c\\) that satisfies both conditions is 12.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of this triangle is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
