    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of triangle \\( \\triangle CEF \\) given that \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are midpoints of sides \\( \\overline{AC} \\) and \\( \\overline{AB} \\) respectively, and the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is 24 square units.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Midpoints**: \n   - Since \\( E \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AC} \\), \\( AE = EC \\).\n   - Since \\( F \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AB} \\), \\( AF = FB \\).\n\n2. **Properties of Midsegment**:\n   - The line segment \\( \\overline{EF} \\) is a midsegment of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n   - A midsegment in a triangle is parallel to the third side and its length is half the length of the third side.\n\n3. **Area Relationship**:\n   - The triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle (like \\( \\triangle CEF \\)) is similar to the original triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n   - The similarity ratio of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) because each side of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is half the length of the corresponding side of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of the similarity ratio.\n   - Therefore, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Given that the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is 24 square units, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6 \\) square units.\n\nThus, the area of \\( \\triangle CEF \\) is 6 square units.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6>>>"
