    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of a polygon with 28 congruent sides, each perpendicular to its adjacent sides, and a perimeter of 56.\n\n1. **Understanding the Polygon:**\n   - The polygon is composed of 28 sides, each perpendicular to its adjacent sides, which suggests it is a type of rectilinear polygon (a polygon whose sides meet at right angles).\n   - All sides are congruent, meaning each side has the same length.\n\n2. **Calculating the Side Length:**\n   - The perimeter of the polygon is given as 56.\n   - Since there are 28 sides, and each side is of equal length, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by the number of sides:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Side length} = \\frac{56}{28} = 2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Understanding the Shape:**\n   - The polygon is essentially a path that turns at right angles, forming a closed loop.\n   - Given the nature of the polygon (each side perpendicular to its adjacent sides), it can be visualized as a series of connected squares or rectangles.\n\n4. **Calculating the Area:**\n   - Since each side is 2 units long, and the polygon is composed of right angles, it can be broken down into smaller squares or rectangles.\n   - The simplest way to calculate the area is to consider the polygon as a series of connected squares, each with a side length of 2.\n   - The number of such squares can be determined by considering the structure of the polygon. Since the polygon is closed and symmetric, it can be visualized as a larger square with some parts removed or added.\n   - The total area of the polygon can be calculated by considering the number of 2x2 squares that fit into the polygon.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Since the polygon is composed of 28 sides, and each side contributes to forming a square, the number of 2x2 squares is half the number of sides (since each square has 4 sides, and each side is shared by two squares).\n   - Therefore, the number of 2x2 squares is \\( \\frac{28}{2} = 14 \\).\n   - The area of each 2x2 square is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n   - Thus, the total area of the polygon is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total area} = 14 \\times 4 = 56\n     \\]\n\nThe area of the polygon is therefore:\n\n<<<56>>>"
