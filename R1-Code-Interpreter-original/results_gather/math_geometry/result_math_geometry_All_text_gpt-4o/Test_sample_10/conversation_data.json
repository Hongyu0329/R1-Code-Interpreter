    "To find the height of the cylinder, we need to use the given formula for the total surface area of a cylinder and the information provided in the problem.\n\n1. **Understand the formula**: The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n   \\[\n   SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh\n   \\]\n   where \\( SA \\) is the total surface area, \\( r \\) is the radius, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n2. **Identify the given values**:\n   - The radius \\( r \\) is given as 2 feet.\n   - The total surface area \\( SA \\) is given as \\( 12\\pi \\) square feet.\n\n3. **Substitute the known values into the formula**:\n   \\[\n   12\\pi = 2\\pi (2)^2 + 2\\pi (2)h\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the equation**:\n   - Calculate \\( 2\\pi (2)^2 \\):\n     \\[\n     2\\pi \\times 4 = 8\\pi\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back into the equation:\n     \\[\n     12\\pi = 8\\pi + 4\\pi h\n     \\]\n\n5. **Isolate the term with \\( h \\)**:\n   - Subtract \\( 8\\pi \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     12\\pi - 8\\pi = 4\\pi h\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     4\\pi = 4\\pi h\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( h \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides by \\( 4\\pi \\):\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{4\\pi}{4\\pi} = 1\n     \\]\n\nThe height of the cylinder is 1 foot.\n\nFinal answer: <<<1>>>"
