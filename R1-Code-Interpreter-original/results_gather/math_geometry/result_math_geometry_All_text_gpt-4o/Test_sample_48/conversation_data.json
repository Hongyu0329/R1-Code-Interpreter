    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of lemon juice in the cylindrical glass. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Shape and Dimensions of the Glass:**\n   - The glass is cylindrical.\n   - The height of the glass is 6 inches.\n   - The diameter of the glass is 2 inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the Radius of the Glass:**\n   - The radius is half of the diameter.\n   - Radius = Diameter / 2 = 2 inches / 2 = 1 inch.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Volume of the Glass:**\n   - The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n   - Substitute the values: \\( V = \\pi \\times (1 \\text{ inch})^2 \\times 6 \\text{ inches} = 6\\pi \\text{ cubic inches} \\).\n\n4. **Determine the Volume of Lemonade in the Glass:**\n   - The glass is half full of lemonade.\n   - Volume of lemonade = Total volume of the glass / 2 = \\( 6\\pi / 2 = 3\\pi \\text{ cubic inches} \\).\n\n5. **Understand the Ratio of Lemon Juice to Water:**\n   - The ratio of lemon juice to water is 1:11.\n   - This means for every 1 part of lemon juice, there are 11 parts of water, making a total of 12 parts.\n\n6. **Calculate the Volume of Lemon Juice:**\n   - The volume of lemon juice is 1 part out of the total 12 parts of the lemonade.\n   - Volume of lemon juice = (1/12) × Volume of lemonade = (1/12) × \\( 3\\pi \\text{ cubic inches} \\).\n\n7. **Calculate the Exact Volume of Lemon Juice:**\n   - Substitute the value of \\(\\pi\\) (approximately 3.14159) to find the volume in decimal form.\n   - Volume of lemon juice = (1/12) × \\( 3 \\times 3.14159 \\) cubic inches ≈ 0.7853975 cubic inches.\n\n8. **Round the Volume to the Nearest Hundredth:**\n   - Round 0.7853975 to the nearest hundredth: 0.79 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the volume of lemon juice in the glass is approximately 0.79 cubic inches.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0.79>>>"
