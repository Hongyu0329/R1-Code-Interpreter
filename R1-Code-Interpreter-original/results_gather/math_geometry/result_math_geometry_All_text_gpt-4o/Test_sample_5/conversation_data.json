    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of an isosceles triangle and use the given information to find the largest angle.\n\n1. **Understanding Isosceles Triangle Properties**:\n   - An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.\n   - The angles opposite these equal sides are also equal.\n\n2. **Given Information**:\n   - One of the angles opposite an equal side is \\(40^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Angles**:\n   - Since the triangle is isosceles, the two angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Therefore, if one of these angles is \\(40^\\circ\\), the other angle opposite the other equal side is also \\(40^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**:\n   - The sum of the angles in any triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Third Angle**:\n   - Let the third angle be \\(x\\).\n   - According to the angle sum property: \n     \\[\n     40^\\circ + 40^\\circ + x = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     80^\\circ + x = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     x = 180^\\circ - 80^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n6. **Identify the Largest Angle**:\n   - In this isosceles triangle, the largest angle is the one that is not equal to the other two, which is \\(100^\\circ\\).\n\nTherefore, the measure of the triangle's largest angle is \\(100^\\circ\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<100>>>"
