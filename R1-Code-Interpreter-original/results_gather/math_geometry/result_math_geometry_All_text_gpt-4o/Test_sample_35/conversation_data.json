    "To find the area of the interior region formed by the lines \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), and the \\( y \\)-axis, we need to determine the points of intersection of these lines and the \\( y \\)-axis, and then calculate the area of the resulting polygon.\n\n**Step 1: Find the intersection points of the lines with the \\( y \\)-axis.**\n\n- For the line \\( y = 2x - 4 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\) to find the \\( y \\)-intercept:\n  \\[\n  y = 2(0) - 4 = -4\n  \\]\n  So, the line intersects the \\( y \\)-axis at the point \\( (0, -4) \\).\n\n- For the line \\( y = -3x + 16 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\) to find the \\( y \\)-intercept:\n  \\[\n  y = -3(0) + 16 = 16\n  \\]\n  So, the line intersects the \\( y \\)-axis at the point \\( (0, 16) \\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the intersection point of the two lines.**\n\nSet the equations of the lines equal to each other to find their intersection:\n\\[\n2x - 4 = -3x + 16\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n2x + 3x = 16 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n5x = 20\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 4 \\) back into one of the line equations to find \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = 2(4) - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4\n\\]\nSo, the lines intersect at the point \\( (4, 4) \\).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the vertices of the triangle formed.**\n\nThe vertices of the triangle are:\n- \\( (0, -4) \\) from the line \\( y = 2x - 4 \\) intersecting the \\( y \\)-axis.\n- \\( (0, 16) \\) from the line \\( y = -3x + 16 \\) intersecting the \\( y \\)-axis.\n- \\( (4, 4) \\) from the intersection of the two lines.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the triangle.**\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a triangle with vertices \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the coordinates of the vertices:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(16-4) + 0(4+4) + 4(-4-16) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 0 + 4(-20) \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -80 \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the interior region is 40 square units.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<40>>>"
