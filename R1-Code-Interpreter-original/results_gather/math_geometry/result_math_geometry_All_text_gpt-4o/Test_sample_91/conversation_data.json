    "To solve this problem, we need to use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that if two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of each chord are equal. Specifically, if two chords \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) intersect at point \\(P\\), then:\n\n\\[\nAP \\cdot PB = CP \\cdot PD\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(AP = 3\\)\n- \\(CP = 8\\)\n\nWe need to find \\(\\frac{BP}{DP}\\).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(BP = x\\)\n- \\(DP = y\\)\n\nAccording to the Power of a Point theorem:\n\n\\[\nAP \\cdot BP = CP \\cdot DP\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot x = 8 \\cdot y\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\), which is \\(\\frac{BP}{DP}\\).\n\nFrom the equation \\(3x = 8y\\), we can solve for \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{8}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio \\(\\frac{BP}{DP}\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
