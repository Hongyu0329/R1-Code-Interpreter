    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of reflecting a point over the y-axis and then calculate the sum of the coordinates of the original and reflected points.\n\n1. **Identify the coordinates of Point A:**\n   - Point A is given as \\((x, 6)\\).\n\n2. **Reflect Point A over the y-axis:**\n   - Reflecting a point \\((x, y)\\) over the y-axis results in the point \\((-x, y)\\).\n   - Therefore, when Point A \\((x, 6)\\) is reflected over the y-axis, it becomes Point B \\((-x, 6)\\).\n\n3. **List the coordinates of Points A and B:**\n   - Point A: \\((x, 6)\\)\n   - Point B: \\((-x, 6)\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of the four coordinate values:**\n   - The coordinates of Point A are \\(x\\) and \\(6\\).\n   - The coordinates of Point B are \\(-x\\) and \\(6\\).\n   - Sum of the coordinates: \\(x + 6 + (-x) + 6\\).\n\n5. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - \\(x + 6 - x + 6 = 0 + 12 = 12\\).\n\n6. **Final answer:**\n   - The sum of the four coordinate values of points A and B is 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
