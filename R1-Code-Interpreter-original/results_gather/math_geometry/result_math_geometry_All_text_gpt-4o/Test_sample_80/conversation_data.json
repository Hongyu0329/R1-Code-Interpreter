    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationship between the circle and the rectangle, and use the given information to find the length of the longer side of the rectangle.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a circle with a radius of 4 cm.\n   - The circle is tangent to three sides of a rectangle.\n   - The area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Area of the Circle:**\n   - The formula for the area of a circle is \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - With a radius \\( r = 4 \\) cm, the area of the circle is \\( A = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\) square centimeters.\n\n3. **Determine the Area of the Rectangle:**\n   - The area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle.\n   - Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \\( 2 \\times 16\\pi = 32\\pi \\) square centimeters.\n\n4. **Analyze the Tangency Condition:**\n   - Since the circle is tangent to three sides of the rectangle, it must be tangent to two adjacent sides and one opposite side.\n   - The distance from the center of the circle to each tangent side is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 4 cm.\n\n5. **Set Up the Rectangle Dimensions:**\n   - Let the sides of the rectangle be \\( l \\) (longer side) and \\( w \\) (shorter side).\n   - The circle is tangent to three sides, so the shorter side \\( w \\) must be equal to the diameter of the circle, which is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) cm.\n\n6. **Calculate the Longer Side:**\n   - We know the area of the rectangle is \\( l \\times w = 32\\pi \\).\n   - Substitute \\( w = 8 \\) cm into the area equation: \\( l \\times 8 = 32\\pi \\).\n   - Solve for \\( l \\): \\( l = \\frac{32\\pi}{8} = 4\\pi \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The length of the longer side of the rectangle is \\( 4\\pi \\) cm.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4\\pi>>>"
