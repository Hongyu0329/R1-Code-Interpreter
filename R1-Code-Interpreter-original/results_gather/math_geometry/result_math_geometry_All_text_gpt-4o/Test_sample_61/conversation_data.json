    "To determine how many cubic feet of snow Khali has to shovel off the sidewalk, we need to calculate the volume of the snow covering the sidewalk. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the snow layer) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nIn this problem, the dimensions of the sidewalk are given as follows:\n\n1. **Length of the sidewalk**: 20 feet\n2. **Width of the sidewalk**: 2 feet\n3. **Depth of the snow (Height)**: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the volume formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 20 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 2 \\, \\text{feet} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{foot} \\]\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the sidewalk (Length \\(\\times\\) Width):**\n\n   \\[ 20 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 2 \\, \\text{feet} = 40 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the snow (Area \\(\\times\\) Depth):**\n\n   \\[ 40 \\, \\text{square feet} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{foot} = 20 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, Khali has to shovel off 20 cubic feet of snow from the sidewalk.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
