    "To determine how many different integer lengths the third side of a triangle can be, given two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, we need to apply the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This gives us three inequalities to consider:\n\n1. \\( a + b > c \\)\n2. \\( a + c > b \\)\n3. \\( b + c > a \\)\n\nIn this problem, we have two known sides, \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\), and we need to find the possible integer values for the third side, \\( c \\).\n\nLet's apply the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 5 + 7 > c \\)  \n   This simplifies to \\( 12 > c \\) or \\( c < 12 \\).\n\n2. \\( 5 + c > 7 \\)  \n   This simplifies to \\( c > 2 \\).\n\n3. \\( 7 + c > 5 \\)  \n   This simplifies to \\( c > -2 \\).  \n   However, since \\( c \\) must be a positive length, this inequality is always satisfied if \\( c > 2 \\).\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have:\n- \\( c > 2 \\)\n- \\( c < 12 \\)\n\nThus, the possible integer values for \\( c \\) are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nCounting these values, we find there are 9 possible integer lengths for the third side.\n\nTherefore, the number of different integer lengths the third side can be is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
