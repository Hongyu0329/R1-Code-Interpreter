    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the size of the cube, its weight, and its value. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the given information:**\n   - A two-inch cube of silver weighs 3 pounds and is worth $200.\n   - We need to find the worth of a three-inch cube of silver.\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the cubes:**\n   - The volume of a cube is given by the formula \\( V = \\text{side}^3 \\).\n   - For the two-inch cube: \\( V_2 = 2^3 = 8 \\) cubic inches.\n   - For the three-inch cube: \\( V_3 = 3^3 = 27 \\) cubic inches.\n\n3. **Determine the relationship between volume and weight:**\n   - The two-inch cube weighs 3 pounds for 8 cubic inches.\n   - Therefore, the weight per cubic inch is \\( \\frac{3 \\text{ pounds}}{8 \\text{ cubic inches}} = 0.375 \\text{ pounds per cubic inch} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the weight of the three-inch cube:**\n   - The three-inch cube has a volume of 27 cubic inches.\n   - Using the weight per cubic inch, the weight of the three-inch cube is \\( 27 \\times 0.375 = 10.125 \\) pounds.\n\n5. **Determine the relationship between weight and value:**\n   - The two-inch cube is worth $200 for 3 pounds.\n   - Therefore, the value per pound is \\( \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.67 \\) dollars per pound.\n\n6. **Calculate the value of the three-inch cube:**\n   - The three-inch cube weighs 10.125 pounds.\n   - Using the value per pound, the value of the three-inch cube is \\( 10.125 \\times 66.67 \\approx 675.00875 \\) dollars.\n\n7. **Round the value to the nearest dollar:**\n   - The value of the three-inch cube, rounded to the nearest dollar, is $675.\n\nTherefore, the worth of the three-inch cube of silver is:\n\n<<<675>>>"
