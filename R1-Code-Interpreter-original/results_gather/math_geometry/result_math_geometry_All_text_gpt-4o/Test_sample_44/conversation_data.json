    "To find the surface area of a sphere given its volume, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the formulas involved:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n     \\]\n   - The surface area \\( A \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     A = 4 \\pi r^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use the given volume to find the radius:**\n   - We are given that the volume of the sphere is \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic inches. So, we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - To solve for \\( r^3 \\), divide both sides by \\(\\pi\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{3} r^3 = 36\n     \\]\n   - Multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) to isolate \\( r^3 \\):\n     \\[\n     r^3 = 36 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 27\n     \\]\n   - Take the cube root of both sides to find \\( r \\):\n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the surface area using the radius:**\n   - Now that we have \\( r = 3 \\), substitute it into the surface area formula:\n     \\[\n     A = 4 \\pi r^2 = 4 \\pi (3)^2 = 4 \\pi \\times 9 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n\n4. **Express the final answer:**\n   - The surface area of the sphere is \\( 36\\pi \\) square inches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<36\\pi>>>"
