    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the third circle that is tangent to two given circles and one of their common external tangents.\n\n1. **Understand the Configuration:**\n   - We have two circles: Circle 1 centered at \\( A \\) with radius 1, and Circle 2 centered at \\( B \\) with radius 4.\n   - These circles are externally tangent, meaning the distance between their centers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is the sum of their radii: \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Positioning the Circles:**\n   - Assume Circle 1 is centered at \\( A = (-1, 1) \\) and Circle 2 is centered at \\( B = (3, 4) \\).\n   - The distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is indeed 5, confirming they are externally tangent.\n\n3. **Third Circle Properties:**\n   - Let the radius of the third circle be \\( r \\).\n   - This circle is tangent to both Circle 1 and Circle 2, and also to one of their common external tangents.\n\n4. **Using Descartes' Circle Theorem:**\n   - Descartes' Circle Theorem relates the curvatures (reciprocals of the radii) of four mutually tangent circles.\n   - If \\( k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 \\) are the curvatures, then:\n     \\[\n     (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)^2 = 2(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2)\n     \\]\n   - For our problem, \\( k_1 = 1 \\), \\( k_2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\), and \\( k_3 = \\frac{1}{r} \\). The fourth circle is the line, which can be considered as a circle with infinite radius, so \\( k_4 = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Applying the Theorem:**\n   - Substitute the known curvatures into the theorem:\n     \\[\n     \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{r}\\right)^2 = 2\\left(1^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^2\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplify and solve for \\( r \\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{1}{r}\\right)^2 = 2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{5r + 4}{4r}\\right)^2 = 2\\left(\\frac{16r^2 + r^2 + 16}{16r^2}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(5r + 4)^2}{16r^2} = \\frac{34r^2 + 32}{8r^2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (5r + 4)^2 = 2(34r^2 + 32)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     25r^2 + 40r + 16 = 68r^2 + 64\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     0 = 43r^2 - 40r + 48\n     \\]\n   - Solve the quadratic equation for \\( r \\).\n\n6. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n   - Use the quadratic formula: \\( r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\).\n   - Here, \\( a = 43 \\), \\( b = -40 \\), \\( c = 48 \\).\n   - Calculate the discriminant: \\( b^2 - 4ac = (-40)^2 - 4 \\times 43 \\times 48 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( r \\).\n\nAfter solving, we find that the radius of the third circle is:\n\n<<<0.44>>>"
