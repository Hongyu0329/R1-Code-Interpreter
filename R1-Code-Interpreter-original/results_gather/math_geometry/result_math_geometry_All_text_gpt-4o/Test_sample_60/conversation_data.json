    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the common chord of two overlapping circles, each with a radius of 10 cm, where each circle passes through the center of the other.\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: \n   - We have two circles, Circle A and Circle B, each with a radius of 10 cm.\n   - The center of Circle A is at point O, and the center of Circle B is at point P.\n   - The distance between O and P is 10 cm because each circle passes through the center of the other.\n\n2. **Identify the Common Chord**:\n   - The common chord is the line segment that is equidistant from both centers and perpendicular to the line segment OP.\n   - The midpoint of the common chord is the midpoint of OP, which is 5 cm from each center.\n\n3. **Use the Right Triangle**:\n   - Consider the right triangle formed by the radius of Circle A (or Circle B), half of the common chord, and the line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord.\n   - The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius of the circle, which is 10 cm.\n   - One leg of the triangle is the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord, which is 5 cm.\n\n4. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be half the length of the common chord.\n   - According to the Pythagorean theorem: \n     \\[\n     x^2 + 5^2 = 10^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 25 = 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 75\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Full Length of the Chord**:\n   - Since \\( x \\) is half the length of the chord, the full length of the chord is:\n     \\[\n     2x = 2 \\times 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the length of the common chord is \\( 10\\sqrt{3} \\) cm.\n\nFinal answer: <<<10\\sqrt{3}>>>"
