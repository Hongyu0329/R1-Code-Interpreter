    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of a trapezoid and the given conditions about the angles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trapezoid Properties:**\n   - A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides.\n   - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Arithmetic Sequence of Angles:**\n   - We are given that the consecutive angles form an arithmetic sequence. Let's denote the angles as \\(a\\), \\(a+d\\), \\(a+2d\\), and \\(a+3d\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n   - The largest angle is given as \\(120^\\circ\\). Since the angles are in increasing order, the largest angle is \\(a+3d = 120^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Sum of Angles:**\n   - The sum of the angles in the trapezoid is:\n     \\[\n     a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     4a + 6d = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute the Largest Angle:**\n   - From \\(a+3d = 120^\\circ\\), we can express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(d\\):\n     \\[\n     a = 120^\\circ - 3d\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute \\(a\\) in the Sum Equation:**\n   - Substitute \\(a = 120^\\circ - 3d\\) into the sum equation:\n     \\[\n     4(120^\\circ - 3d) + 6d = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     480^\\circ - 12d + 6d = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     480^\\circ - 6d = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(d\\):\n     \\[\n     120^\\circ = 6d \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d = 20^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n6. **Find the Smallest Angle:**\n   - The smallest angle is \\(a\\), which we found to be \\(a = 120^\\circ - 3d\\).\n   - Substitute \\(d = 20^\\circ\\):\n     \\[\n     a = 120^\\circ - 3(20^\\circ) = 120^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of the smallest angle is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<60>>>"
