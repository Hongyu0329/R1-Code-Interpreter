    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the square given the arrangement of the circles.\n\n1. **Understand the Arrangement**: \n   - We have a square and four circles.\n   - Each circle has a radius of 5 inches.\n   - The circles are arranged such that they are tangent to each other and to the sides of the square.\n\n2. **Determine the Side Length of the Square**:\n   - Since the circles are tangent to each other and to the sides of the square, the centers of the circles form a smaller square inside the larger square.\n   - The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles (horizontally or vertically) is equal to the diameter of a circle, which is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) inches.\n   - The smaller square formed by the centers of the circles has a side length of 10 inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the Side Length of the Larger Square**:\n   - The larger square's side length is equal to the side length of the smaller square plus twice the radius of a circle (since the circles are tangent to the sides of the larger square).\n   - Therefore, the side length of the larger square is \\(10 + 2 \\times 5 = 20\\) inches.\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of the Square**:\n   - The area of a square is given by the formula \\( \\text{side length}^2 \\).\n   - Thus, the area of the square is \\(20^2 = 400\\) square inches.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The area of the square is 400 square inches.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<400>>>."
