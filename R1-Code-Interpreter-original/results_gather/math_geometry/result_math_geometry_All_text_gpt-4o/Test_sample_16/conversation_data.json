    "To find the length of diagonal \\( DA \\) in the regular hexagon, we need to understand the properties of a regular hexagon and the specific diagonal in question.\n\n1. **Properties of a Regular Hexagon:**\n   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.\n   - All sides of a regular hexagon are equal.\n   - The diagonals of a regular hexagon can be of two types: those that span across two sides (shorter diagonals) and those that span across three sides (longer diagonals).\n\n2. **Understanding the Diagonal \\( DA \\):**\n   - In the given hexagon, \\( DA \\) is a longer diagonal because it connects two opposite vertices of the hexagon.\n   - The longer diagonal of a regular hexagon is equal to twice the side length of the hexagon.\n\n3. **Given Information:**\n   - The side length of the hexagon is given as 10 units.\n\n4. **Calculating the Length of Diagonal \\( DA \\):**\n   - Since \\( DA \\) is a longer diagonal, it spans across three sides of the hexagon.\n   - Therefore, the length of diagonal \\( DA \\) is twice the side length of the hexagon.\n   - Thus, the length of \\( DA \\) is \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) units.\n\n5. **Expressing the Answer:**\n   - The length of diagonal \\( DA \\) is already in its simplest form as a whole number.\n\nTherefore, the length of diagonal \\( DA \\) is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
