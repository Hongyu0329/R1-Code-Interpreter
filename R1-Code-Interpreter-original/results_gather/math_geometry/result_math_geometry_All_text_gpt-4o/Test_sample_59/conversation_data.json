    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of an octagon that is inscribed in a square, where the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   - The perimeter of the square is given as 108 centimeters.\n   - Since a square has four equal sides, the side length of the square is \\( \\frac{108}{4} = 27 \\) centimeters.\n\n2. **Understand the trisection of the square's sides:**\n   - Trisecting each side of the square means dividing each side into three equal parts.\n   - Each part will be \\( \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\) centimeters long.\n\n3. **Identify the vertices of the octagon:**\n   - The octagon is formed by cutting off the corners of the square.\n   - Each corner of the square is cut off by a right triangle with legs of 9 cm each (since the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square).\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the square:**\n   - The area of the square is \\( 27 \\times 27 = 729 \\) square centimeters.\n\n5. **Calculate the area of one corner triangle:**\n   - Each corner triangle is a right triangle with legs of 9 cm.\n   - The area of one triangle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9 \\times 9 = 40.5 \\) square centimeters.\n\n6. **Calculate the total area of the four corner triangles:**\n   - Since there are four corners, the total area of the triangles is \\( 4 \\times 40.5 = 162 \\) square centimeters.\n\n7. **Calculate the area of the octagon:**\n   - The area of the octagon is the area of the square minus the total area of the four corner triangles.\n   - Therefore, the area of the octagon is \\( 729 - 162 = 567 \\) square centimeters.\n\nThus, the number of square centimeters in the area of the octagon is:\n\n<<<567>>>"
