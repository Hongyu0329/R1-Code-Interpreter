    "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle, given that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - We have a square and a circle intersecting such that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle.\n   - The length of each chord is equal to the radius of the circle, \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Chords and Geometry**:\n   - A chord of a circle is a line segment with both endpoints on the circle.\n   - If a chord is equal to the radius of the circle, it forms an isosceles triangle with the center of the circle.\n\n3. **Positioning the Square and Circle**:\n   - Assume the circle is centered at the origin \\((0, 0)\\) in a coordinate plane.\n   - The square is positioned such that its sides are parallel to the axes.\n\n4. **Finding the Side Length of the Square**:\n   - Consider one side of the square, say from \\((-a, b)\\) to \\((a, b)\\).\n   - The chord on this side is horizontal and has length \\( r \\).\n   - The midpoint of this chord is directly above the center of the circle, at \\((0, b)\\).\n   - The distance from the center of the circle to the chord is the perpendicular distance, which is \\( b \\).\n\n5. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - The distance from the center of the circle to the endpoints of the chord is the radius \\( r \\).\n   - By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n     \\[\n     a^2 + b^2 = r^2\n     \\]\n   - Since the chord length is \\( r \\), and it is horizontal, the length of the chord is \\( 2a = r \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( a = \\frac{r}{2} \\).\n\n6. **Solving for \\( b \\)**:\n   - Substitute \\( a = \\frac{r}{2} \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2 + b^2 = r^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{r^2}{4} + b^2 = r^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b^2 = r^2 - \\frac{r^2}{4} = \\frac{3r^2}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\( b = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{2} \\).\n\n7. **Side Length of the Square**:\n   - The side length of the square is \\( 2b = \\sqrt{3}r \\).\n\n8. **Area of the Square**:\n   - The area of the square is:\n     \\[\n     (\\sqrt{3}r)^2 = 3r^2\n     \\]\n\n9. **Area of the Circle**:\n   - The area of the circle is:\n     \\[\n     \\pi r^2\n     \\]\n\n10. **Ratio of the Areas**:\n    - The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}\n      \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is \\(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<\\frac{3}{\\pi}>>>"
