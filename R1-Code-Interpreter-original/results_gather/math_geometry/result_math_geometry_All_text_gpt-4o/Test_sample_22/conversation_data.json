    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the gray region between two concentric circles. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have two concentric circles (circles with the same center).\n   - The radius of the outer circle is twice the radius of the inner circle.\n   - The width of the gray region (the area between the two circles) is given as 2 feet.\n\n2. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( r \\) be the radius of the inner circle.\n   - Then, the radius of the outer circle is \\( 2r \\).\n\n3. **Width of the Gray Region:**\n   - The width of the gray region is the difference between the radii of the outer and inner circles.\n   - Therefore, \\( 2r - r = r \\).\n   - We are given that this width is 2 feet, so \\( r = 2 \\) feet.\n\n4. **Calculate Radii:**\n   - Inner circle radius \\( r = 2 \\) feet.\n   - Outer circle radius \\( 2r = 4 \\) feet.\n\n5. **Calculate Areas:**\n   - Area of the inner circle: \\( \\pi r^2 = \\pi (2)^2 = 4\\pi \\) square feet.\n   - Area of the outer circle: \\( \\pi (2r)^2 = \\pi (4)^2 = 16\\pi \\) square feet.\n\n6. **Calculate the Area of the Gray Region:**\n   - The area of the gray region is the difference between the area of the outer circle and the area of the inner circle.\n   - Area of the gray region = \\( 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi \\) square feet.\n\nTherefore, the area of the gray region is \\( 12\\pi \\) square feet.\n\nFinal answer: <<<12\\pi>>>"
