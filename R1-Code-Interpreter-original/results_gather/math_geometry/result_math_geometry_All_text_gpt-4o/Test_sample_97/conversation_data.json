    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of segment \\(\\overline{EC}\\) in trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) where the measure of base \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is twice the measure of base \\(\\overline{CD}\\), and the measure of diagonal \\(\\overline{AC}\\) is 11.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Trapezoid:**\n   - \\(ABCD\\) is a trapezoid with \\(\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{CD}\\).\n   - The length of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is twice the length of \\(\\overline{CD}\\).\n\n2. **Properties of Diagonals in a Trapezoid:**\n   - In a trapezoid, the diagonals intersect at a point \\(E\\) such that the segments are divided proportionally.\n   - Specifically, if \\(E\\) is the intersection of diagonals \\(\\overline{AC}\\) and \\(\\overline{BD}\\), then:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{AE}{EC} = \\frac{BE}{ED}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Using the Given Information:**\n   - We know \\(\\overline{AC} = 11\\).\n   - We need to find \\(\\overline{EC}\\).\n\n4. **Applying the Proportionality:**\n   - Since \\(\\overline{AB} = 2 \\times \\overline{CD}\\), the trapezoid is symmetric in terms of the division of diagonals.\n   - The point \\(E\\) divides \\(\\overline{AC}\\) and \\(\\overline{BD}\\) in the same ratio as the bases.\n   - Therefore, the ratio \\(\\frac{AE}{EC}\\) is the same as the ratio of the bases, which is \\(2:1\\).\n\n5. **Calculating \\(\\overline{EC}\\):**\n   - Let \\(\\overline{EC} = x\\).\n   - Then \\(\\overline{AE} = 2x\\) because \\(\\frac{AE}{EC} = 2\\).\n   - Since \\(\\overline{AC} = \\overline{AE} + \\overline{EC} = 11\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     2x + x = 11\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3x = 11\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{11}{3}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the length of segment \\(\\overline{EC}\\) is \\(\\frac{11}{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<\\(\\frac{11}{3}\\)>>>."
