    "To compute \\(\\sin 225^\\circ\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Reference Angle:**\n   - The angle \\(225^\\circ\\) is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n   - The reference angle for \\(225^\\circ\\) is found by subtracting \\(180^\\circ\\) from \\(225^\\circ\\):\n     \\[\n     225^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 45^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Sign of the Sine Function:**\n   - In the third quadrant, the sine function is negative.\n\n3. **Compute the Sine of the Reference Angle:**\n   - The sine of \\(45^\\circ\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Apply the Sign to the Reference Angle's Sine:**\n   - Since the sine function is negative in the third quadrant, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\sin 225^\\circ = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0.70710678118>>>"
