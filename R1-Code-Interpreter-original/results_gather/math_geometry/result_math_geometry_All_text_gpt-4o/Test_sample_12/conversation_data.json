    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of a sphere that is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of a truncated cone. The truncated cone has two horizontal bases with radii 18 and 2.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: \n   - A truncated cone is a cone with the top cut off parallel to the base. It has two circular bases: a larger base with radius \\( R_1 = 18 \\) and a smaller base with radius \\( R_2 = 2 \\).\n   - The sphere is tangent to the top base, bottom base, and the lateral surface of the truncated cone.\n\n2. **Visualize the Problem**:\n   - Imagine the truncated cone standing upright with the larger base at the bottom and the smaller base at the top.\n   - The sphere is inside the truncated cone, touching both bases and the slanted side.\n\n3. **Use the Properties of Tangency**:\n   - The sphere is tangent to the top and bottom bases, meaning the distance from the center of the sphere to each base is equal to the radius of the sphere, \\( r \\).\n   - The sphere is also tangent to the lateral surface, which means the distance from the center of the sphere to the slant height of the cone is also \\( r \\).\n\n4. **Set Up the Problem**:\n   - The height of the truncated cone is not given, but it is not needed directly. Instead, we use the fact that the sphere is tangent to the lateral surface.\n   - The center of the sphere lies on the axis of the truncated cone.\n\n5. **Apply the Formula for the Radius of the Sphere**:\n   - The formula for the radius \\( r \\) of a sphere tangent to the bases and lateral surface of a truncated cone is given by:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{R_1 \\cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the given values \\( R_1 = 18 \\) and \\( R_2 = 2 \\) into the formula:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{18 \\cdot 2}{18 + 2} = \\frac{36}{20} = 1.8\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The radius of the sphere that is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of the truncated cone is 1.8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.8>>>"
