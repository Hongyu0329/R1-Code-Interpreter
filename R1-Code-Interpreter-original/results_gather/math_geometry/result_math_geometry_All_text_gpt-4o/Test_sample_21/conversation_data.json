    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the shaded region formed by semicircles of diameter 2 inches lined up over a 1-foot (12 inches) length.\n\n1. **Understand the Pattern:**\n   - Each semicircle has a diameter of 2 inches, which means the radius \\( r \\) is 1 inch.\n   - The semicircles are arranged such that the top semicircles are aligned with their diameters on the line, and the bottom semicircles are inverted and fit between the top semicircles.\n\n2. **Calculate the Area of One Semicircle:**\n   - The area of a full circle with radius \\( r = 1 \\) inch is \\( \\pi \\times r^2 = \\pi \\times 1^2 = \\pi \\) square inches.\n   - Therefore, the area of one semicircle is half of that: \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) square inches.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Semicircles in 12 Inches:**\n   - Since each semicircle has a diameter of 2 inches, the number of semicircles that can fit in 12 inches is \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Area of Semicircles:**\n   - There are 6 top semicircles and 6 bottom semicircles, each contributing an area of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) square inches.\n   - Total area of all semicircles = \\( 6 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 6 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 6\\pi \\) square inches.\n\n5. **Determine the Shaded Area:**\n   - The shaded area is the area covered by the semicircles minus the overlapping areas.\n   - Since the top and bottom semicircles are perfectly aligned and do not overlap, the shaded area is simply the total area of the semicircles.\n\nThus, the area of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of this pattern is \\( 6\\pi \\) square inches.\n\nFinal answer: <<<6\\pi>>>"
