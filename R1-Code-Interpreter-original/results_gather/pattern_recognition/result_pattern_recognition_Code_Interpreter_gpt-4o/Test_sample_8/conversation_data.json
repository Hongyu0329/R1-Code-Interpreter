    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for squares of the same character. We'll start by checking for squares of size 3x3 and then increase the size if possible. We'll keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Iterate through each cell in the matrix.\n2. For each cell, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square of size 3x3 or larger.\n3. If a square is found, update the largest square size and its bottom-right corner coordinates.\n4. Output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the matrix\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # Update the largest square found\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Given character matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'I', 'V', 'Q', 'I', 'G'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'L', 'F', 'V', 'W'],\n    ['C', 'Y', 'V', 'V', 'J', 'T'],\n    ['R', 'M', 'J', 'J', 'Q', 'R'],\n    ['C', 'O', 'T', 'K', 'T', 'X'],\n    ['Z', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'T'],\n    ['L', 'F', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['H', 'R', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'Q'],\n    ['T', 'H', 'W', 'A', 'T', 'Q'],\n    ['G', 'I', 'U', 'M', 'U', 'V']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix is at row 7, column 4.
