    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where all sides are composed of the same character and have a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix to find such squares. We'll check for squares starting from each position in the matrix and see if we can form a square of size 3x3 or larger with the same character. Once we find such a square, we'll record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_squares(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_square_size = min(rows, cols)\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, max_square_size + 1):\n                if i + size <= rows and j + size <= cols:\n                    # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                    char = matrix[i][j]\n                    is_square = True\n                    for x in range(i, i + size):\n                        for y in range(j, j + size):\n                            if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                                is_square = False\n                                break\n                        if not is_square:\n                            break\n                    if is_square:\n                        result.append((i + size - 1, j + size - 1))\n    return result\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'A', 'W', 'G', 'J', 'I', 'L', 'W', 'H'],\n    ['L', 'I', 'P', 'E', 'B', 'T', 'J', 'Z', 'C'],\n    ['R', 'P', 'H', 'P', 'D', 'H', 'G', 'D', 'N'],\n    ['J', 'J', 'J', 'D', 'N', 'T', 'P', 'N', 'G'],\n    ['J', 'J', 'J', 'O', 'R', 'O', 'A', 'A', 'H'],\n    ['J', 'J', 'J', 'M', 'C', 'V', 'P', 'T', 'J'],\n    ['S', 'R', 'U', 'E', 'L', 'E', 'Z', 'K', 'F']\n]\n\n# Find the positions of the bottom-right corners of squares\nsquares = find_squares(matrix)\nsquares\nassistant > The position of the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix is \\([5, 2]\\).
