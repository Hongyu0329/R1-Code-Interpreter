    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix to find such squares. We'll iterate through each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of increasing size can be formed. We'll keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n\n                # Update the largest square found\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'F', 'Q', 'G', 'Q', 'B', 'D', 'Z', 'X', 'D', 'N', 'J'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'I', 'D', 'M', 'O', 'B', 'U', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'Q'],\n    ['F', 'N', 'V', 'I', 'F', 'S', 'T', 'P', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'V'],\n    ['V', 'E', 'Y', 'B', 'Y', 'V', 'K', 'H', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'H'],\n    ['I', 'Q', 'D', 'W', 'Q', 'L', 'D', 'R', 'P', 'B', 'D', 'O'],\n    ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'D', 'E', 'G', 'O', 'N', 'I', 'D', 'D', 'R'],\n    ['R', 'Q', 'K', 'R', 'C', 'I', 'W', 'G', 'S', 'P', 'A', 'H']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is at row 3 and column 10.
