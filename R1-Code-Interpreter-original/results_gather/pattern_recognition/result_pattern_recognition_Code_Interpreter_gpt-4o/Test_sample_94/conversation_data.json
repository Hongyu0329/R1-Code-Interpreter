    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\nG R Z K I V\nC J H B Y K\nB L L Q U X\nU O R Q T R\nZ E L O O O\nX J J O O O\nC Y M O O O\n```\n\nWe will iterate through the matrix to find squares of the same character. We will start from the top-left corner and check for squares of increasing size. Once we find a square of size 3 or more, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's write a function to perform this task.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Initialize a table to store the size of the largest square ending at each point\n    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Variable to store the maximum size of the square found\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n    \n    # Iterate through the matrix\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # The first row and first column can only have squares of size 1\n            if i == 0 or j == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                # Check if the current cell can be part of a square\n                if matrix[i][j] == matrix[i-1][j] == matrix[i][j-1] == matrix[i-1][j-1]:\n                    # Update the size of the square ending at this cell\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = 1\n            \n            # Update the maximum size and bottom-right corner if a larger square is found\n            if dp[i][j] > max_size:\n                max_size = dp[i][j]\n                bottom_right_corner = (i, j)\n    \n    # Check if the largest square is at least 3x3\n    if max_size >= 3:\n        return bottom_right_corner\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'R', 'Z', 'K', 'I', 'V'],\n    ['C', 'J', 'H', 'B', 'Y', 'K'],\n    ['B', 'L', 'L', 'Q', 'U', 'X'],\n    ['U', 'O', 'R', 'Q', 'T', 'R'],\n    ['Z', 'E', 'L', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'J', 'J', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['C', 'Y', 'M', 'O', 'O', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix is at row 6, column 5.
