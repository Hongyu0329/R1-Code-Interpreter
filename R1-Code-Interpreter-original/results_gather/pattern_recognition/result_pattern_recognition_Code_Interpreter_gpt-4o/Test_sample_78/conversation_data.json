    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. Verify if all elements in the potential square are the same character.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Return the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_side = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the matrix\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for potential squares with side length >= 3\n            for side in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                if all(matrix[i + k][j + l] == matrix[i][j] for k in range(side) for l in range(side)):\n                    if side > max_side:\n                        max_side = side\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the character matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['V', 'J', 'Q', 'W', 'S', 'X', 'C', 'B'],\n    ['T', 'X', 'R', 'K', 'K', 'Z', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['J', 'T', 'X', 'R', 'A', 'S', 'L', 'X'],\n    ['J', 'H', 'H', 'J', 'M', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['Q', 'T', 'I', 'F', 'H', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['A', 'K', 'T', 'X', 'R', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['P', 'N', 'J', 'N', 'T', 'G', 'K', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix is at position \\([5, 7]\\)."
