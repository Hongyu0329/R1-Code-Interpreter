    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. Verify if all elements in the potential square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Continue this process to find the largest square, as the answer is unique.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_side = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the matrix\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for potential squares with side length >= 3\n            for side in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and side > max_side:\n                    max_side = side\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'M', 'Q', 'A', 'J', 'N', 'Z', 'I', 'B', 'F', 'H', 'W', 'M', 'W'],\n    ['A', 'V', 'O', 'A', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'M', 'X', 'B', 'C', 'N', 'M', 'V'],\n    ['X', 'Z', 'Z', 'D', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'S', 'V', 'J', 'N', 'R', 'D', 'L'],\n    ['S', 'Z', 'T', 'O', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'P', 'M', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'D', 'T'],\n    ['B', 'W', 'O', 'Q', 'E', 'I', 'B', 'A', 'K', 'A', 'Q', 'X', 'N', 'T'],\n    ['K', 'O', 'V', 'B', 'U', 'G', 'O', 'B', 'Q', 'S', 'F', 'R', 'U', 'J']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is at position \\([3, 6]\\) in the matrix."
