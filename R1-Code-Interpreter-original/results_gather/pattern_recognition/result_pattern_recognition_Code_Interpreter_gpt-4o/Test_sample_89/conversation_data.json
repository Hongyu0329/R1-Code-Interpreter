    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for such squares. We'll iterate through each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. If a square is found, we'll record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_square_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a square is found, update the largest square size and bottom-right corner\n                if is_square and size > max_square_size:\n                    max_square_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'Q', 'P', 'W', 'M', 'D', 'P', 'W'],\n    ['O', 'S', 'C', 'T', 'A', 'O', 'Y', 'B'],\n    ['F', 'M', 'Q', 'Q', 'L', 'I', 'S', 'R'],\n    ['K', 'Y', 'D', 'P', 'B', 'W', 'E', 'A'],\n    ['O', 'I', 'C', 'U', 'X', 'S', 'H', 'I'],\n    ['R', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'C', 'L', 'T', 'I'],\n    ['K', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'G', 'Z', 'E', 'W'],\n    ['X', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'L', 'Z', 'M', 'D'],\n    ['S', 'W', 'O', 'X', 'E', 'V', 'H', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'I', 'W', 'J', 'O', 'I', 'Z'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'N', 'W', 'S'],\n    ['L', 'D', 'X', 'Q', 'O', 'T', 'C', 'N']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is located at row 7 and column 3.
