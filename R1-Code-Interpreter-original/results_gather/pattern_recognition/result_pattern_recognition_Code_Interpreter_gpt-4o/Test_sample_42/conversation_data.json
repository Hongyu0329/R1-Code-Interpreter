    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for squares of the same character. We'll start by checking for squares of size 3x3 and then increase the size if possible.
