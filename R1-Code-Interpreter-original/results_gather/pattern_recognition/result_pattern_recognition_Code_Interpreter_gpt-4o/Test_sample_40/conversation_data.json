    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for such squares. We'll start by checking for squares of size 3x3, then 4x4, and so on, until we find the largest possible square. We'll keep track of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = min(rows, cols)\n    largest_square = (0, 0, 0)  # (size, row, col)\n\n    # Check for squares of increasing size\n    for size in range(3, max_size + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    largest_square = (size, i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return [largest_square[1], largest_square[2]]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'E', 'L', 'F', 'L', 'B'],\n    ['Q', 'V', 'L', 'Q', 'F', 'X'],\n    ['T', 'P', 'K', 'J', 'U', 'R'],\n    ['D', 'Q', 'D', 'W', 'A', 'Y'],\n    ['W', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S'],\n    ['A', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'Y', 'E'],\n    ['B', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'G', 'J'],\n    ['V', 'R', 'T', 'I', 'X', 'M']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nfind_largest_square(matrix)\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix is at row 6, column 3.
