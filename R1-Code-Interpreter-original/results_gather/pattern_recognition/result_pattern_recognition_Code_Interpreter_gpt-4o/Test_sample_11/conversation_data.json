    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where all sides are composed of the same character and have a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3, and identify the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell in the matrix.\n2. For each cell, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square of size 3x3 or larger.\n3. Verify if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n4. Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each cell to check if it can be the top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # Update the largest square found\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the character matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'D', 'L', 'G', 'V', 'L', 'V'],\n    ['A', 'K', 'L', 'K', 'E', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['L', 'Z', 'O', 'A', 'V', 'A', 'M'],\n    ['M', 'M', 'M', 'Z', 'K', 'W', 'S'],\n    ['M', 'M', 'M', 'J', 'C', 'M', 'Y'],\n    ['M', 'M', 'M', 'C', 'W', 'Q', 'D'],\n    ['M', 'Y', 'Q', 'P', 'I', 'X', 'Z'],\n    ['A', 'F', 'F', 'U', 'D', 'U', 'G'],\n    ['R', 'L', 'N', 'P', 'P', 'U', 'K'],\n    ['P', 'C', 'M', 'C', 'R', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['V', 'E', 'O', 'J', 'B', 'R', 'I'],\n    ['X', 'Y', 'C', 'R', 'N', 'R', 'R'],\n    ['U', 'C', 'F', 'Z', 'Q', 'T', 'A'],\n    ['Z', 'W', 'H', 'X', 'P', 'M', 'P']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is at position \\([5, 2]\\) in the matrix."
