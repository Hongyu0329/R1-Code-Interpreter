    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where all sides are composed of the same character and have a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix.\n2. For each top-left corner, check for squares of increasing size (starting from 3x3) to see if all characters in the square are the same.\n3. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n4. Continue this process until the entire matrix is checked.\n5. Output the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_square_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and size > max_square_size:\n                    max_square_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the character matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X', 'V', 'M', 'P', 'Z', 'I', 'V', 'L'],\n    ['P', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'H', 'E', 'M', 'X', 'Q', 'P', 'W'],\n    ['R', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'C', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'O', 'T', 'D', 'S'],\n    ['N', 'I', 'B', 'O', 'X', 'T', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'V', 'A', 'T'],\n    ['U', 'T', 'X', 'P', 'E', 'Y', 'U', 'Y', 'P', 'F', 'N', 'F'],\n    ['H', 'B', 'Z', 'I', 'M', 'N', 'X', 'Y', 'A', 'G', 'J', 'W']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is located at row 2 and column 3.
