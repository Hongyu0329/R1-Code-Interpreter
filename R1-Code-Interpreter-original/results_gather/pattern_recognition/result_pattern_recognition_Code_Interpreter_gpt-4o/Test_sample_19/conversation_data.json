    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for such squares. We'll iterate through each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of increasing size can be formed. Once we find a square of size 3 or more, we'll record the bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Function to check if a square of size `size` can be formed with top-left corner at (r, c)\n    def is_square(r, c, size):\n        char = matrix[r][c]\n        if r + size > rows or c + size > cols:\n            return False\n        for i in range(size):\n            for j in range(size):\n                if matrix[r + i][c + j] != char:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            size = 3\n            while is_square(r, c, size):\n                size += 1\n            # If a square of size 3 or more was found, return the bottom-right corner\n            if size > 3:\n                return [r + size - 2, c + size - 2]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'L', 'H', 'E', 'X', 'Q', 'Y', 'D', 'Y', 'B', 'E', 'F'],\n    ['L', 'I', 'A', 'M', 'B', 'G', 'X', 'C', 'N', 'J', 'V', 'W'],\n    ['C', 'Q', 'W', 'N', 'F', 'A', 'B', 'U', 'O', 'P', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['F', 'O', 'K', 'I', 'L', 'A', 'Z', 'F', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'G'],\n    ['I', 'V', 'S', 'Q', 'N', 'T', 'M', 'C', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'E'],\n    ['G', 'T', 'V', 'P', 'K', 'H', 'G', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'I']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nfind_largest_square(matrix)\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix is at position \\([5, 10]\\)."
