    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\nP S K Y A O X B H C\nT Y Z V T M K X A T\nD P R O Z K K K Y J\nR X K W M K K K N G\nB V B T D K K K K I\nB M I D X M P E A K\n```\n\nWe will iterate through the matrix to find squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3.
