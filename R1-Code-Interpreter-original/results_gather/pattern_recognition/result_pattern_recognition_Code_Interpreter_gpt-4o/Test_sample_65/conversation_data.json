    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix to find such squares. We'll start by checking for squares of size 3x3 and then increase the size if possible. We'll iterate through the matrix and check for squares starting from each position.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Iterate through each cell in the matrix.\n2. For each cell, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square of size 3x3 or larger.\n3. If a square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n4. Continue this process until the entire matrix is checked.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Function to check if a square of a given size can be formed\n    def is_square(r, c, size):\n        char = matrix[r][c]\n        for i in range(size):\n            for j in range(size):\n                if matrix[r + i][c + j] != char:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            size = 3\n            while r + size <= rows and c + size <= cols:\n                if is_square(r, c, size):\n                    if size > max_size:\n                        max_size = size\n                        bottom_right_corner = (r + size - 1, c + size - 1)\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'Y', 'V', 'F', 'O', 'X', 'U', 'Q', 'Y'],\n    ['B', 'Y', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'Z', 'Y', 'F', 'X', 'G', 'G', 'Z', 'M', 'I'],\n    ['L', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'J', 'L', 'M', 'S', 'U', 'G', 'E', 'T', 'X'],\n    ['B', 'S', 'T', 'R', 'E', 'U', 'S', 'A', 'O', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'X', 'A'],\n    ['N', 'F', 'T', 'S', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'C', 'W', 'Q', 'V', 'T', 'A', 'H'],\n    ['T', 'D', 'V', 'U', 'H', 'M', 'E', 'H', 'S', 'Q', 'Q', 'R', 'Z', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is located at row 2 and column 4.
