    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where all sides are composed of the same character and have a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3, and identify the largest square that meets the criteria.
