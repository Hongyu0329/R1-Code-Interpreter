    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where all sides are composed of the same character and have a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3, and identify the largest square that meets the criteria. We'll keep track of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square.\n2. For each top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n3. If a valid square is found, update the position of the bottom-right corner.\n4. Continue until the entire matrix is checked.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the bottom-right corner\n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the character matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'H', 'M', 'K', 'H', 'L', 'X', 'G', 'S', 'R'],\n    ['A', 'L', 'Z', 'D', 'Z', 'S', 'S', 'R', 'G', 'X'],\n    ['N', 'O', 'P', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'B', 'I', 'H'],\n    ['R', 'R', 'Y', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'H', 'D', 'V'],\n    ['J', 'I', 'X', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'D', 'Y', 'I'],\n    ['T', 'N', 'G', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'Z', 'L', 'J'],\n    ['C', 'V', 'E', 'T', 'D', 'P', 'Q', 'T', 'Y', 'B'],\n    ['C', 'J', 'A', 'N', 'S', 'S', 'J', 'S', 'O', 'E']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is at position \\([5, 6]\\) in the matrix.
