    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where all sides are composed of the same character and have a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for such squares. We'll start by iterating through each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of size 3 or more can be formed. If a square is found, we'll record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_squares(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_square_size = min(rows, cols)\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, max_square_size + 1):\n                if i + size <= rows and j + size <= cols:\n                    # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                    char = matrix[i][j]\n                    is_square = True\n                    for x in range(i, i + size):\n                        for y in range(j, j + size):\n                            if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                                is_square = False\n                                break\n                        if not is_square:\n                            break\n                    if is_square:\n                        result.append((i + size - 1, j + size - 1))\n    \n    return result\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'N', 'W', 'Y', 'F', 'A', 'R'],\n    ['O', 'C', 'Z', 'U', 'J', 'D', 'Y'],\n    ['Z', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'P'],\n    ['N', 'J', 'S', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['M', 'H', 'H', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'S'],\n    ['P', 'W', 'A', 'A', 'P', 'M', 'U'],\n    ['R', 'P', 'S', 'F', 'M', 'P', 'B'],\n    ['H', 'T', 'B', 'C', 'X', 'J', 'B'],\n    ['O', 'Z', 'X', 'A', 'P', 'E', 'V']\n]\n\n# Find the squares\nsquares = find_squares(matrix)\nsquares\nassistant > The position of the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix is \\([4, 5]\\).
