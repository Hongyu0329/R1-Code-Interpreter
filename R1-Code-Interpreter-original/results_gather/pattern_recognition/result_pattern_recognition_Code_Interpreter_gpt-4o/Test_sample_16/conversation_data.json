    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's go through the matrix and check for such squares. We'll start by iterating through each element in the matrix and checking if it can be the top-left corner of a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. If it can, we'll verify the square and record the bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_squares(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    squares = []\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the matrix\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size at least 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Record the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    squares.append((i + size - 1, j + size - 1))\n\n    return squares\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'O', 'T', 'I', 'A', 'S'],\n    ['D', 'Y', 'R', 'B', 'U', 'O'],\n    ['Y', 'M', 'S', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['N', 'G', 'H', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['Q', 'S', 'X', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['V', 'P', 'M', 'K', 'Z', 'J'],\n    ['E', 'X', 'X', 'M', 'F', 'N']\n]\n\n# Find the squares\nsquares = find_squares(matrix)\nsquares\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is located at row 4 and column 5.
