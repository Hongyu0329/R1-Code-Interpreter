    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's go through the matrix to find such squares. We'll iterate through each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of increasing size can be formed. We'll keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Iterate over each cell in the matrix as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n2. For each cell, attempt to form squares of increasing size.\n3. Check if all characters in the square are the same.\n4. Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each cell as a potential top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # Update the largest square found\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the character matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'P', 'U', 'S', 'N', 'S', 'A'],\n    ['L', 'C', 'S', 'P', 'E', 'X', 'M'],\n    ['I', 'F', 'Z', 'C', 'A', 'K', 'S'],\n    ['Y', 'E', 'C', 'H', 'B', 'M', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'C', 'F', 'C', 'C', 'Q', 'F'],\n    ['R', 'J', 'F', 'M', 'X', 'X', 'K'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'U', 'Q', 'M'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'K', 'F'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'U', 'P', 'D'],\n    ['Q', 'L', 'F', 'A', 'R', 'W', 'K'],\n    ['X', 'P', 'A', 'X', 'I', 'U', 'Z'],\n    ['T', 'Z', 'U', 'X', 'P', 'B', 'F']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nbottom_right_corner = find_largest_square(matrix)\nbottom_right_corner\nassistant > The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is at row 8 and column 2.
