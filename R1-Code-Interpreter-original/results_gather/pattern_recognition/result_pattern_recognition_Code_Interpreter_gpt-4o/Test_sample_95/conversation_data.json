    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. If a square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n4.
