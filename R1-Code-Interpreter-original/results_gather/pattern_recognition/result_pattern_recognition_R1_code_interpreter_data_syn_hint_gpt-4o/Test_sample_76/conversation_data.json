    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, the matrix is 10 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit. This means iterating from row 0 to row 7 and column 0 to column 3, as these are the last positions where a 3x3 square can start.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed with the same character. If a square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the largest square.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible starting point for a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['P', 'T', 'R', 'Z', 'B', 'V'],\n    ['P', 'L', 'R', 'U', 'Q', 'U'],\n    ['X', 'M', 'C', 'R', 'D', 'Y'],\n    ['N', 'E', 'A', 'S', 'W', 'X'],\n    ['C', 'I', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'Y'],\n    ['J', 'F', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'Y'],\n    ['H', 'G', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'E'],\n    ['R', 'N', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'N'],\n    ['W', 'F', 'L', 'M', 'L', 'E'],\n    ['Z', 'W', 'C', 'Z', 'J', 'I']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3 and output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (6, 4). Let's verify this result by reasoning through the matrix.\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3. The matrix is:\n\n   ```\n   P T R Z B V\n   P L R U Q U\n   X M C R D Y\n   N E A S W X\n   C I L L L Y\n   J F L L L Y\n   H G L L L E\n   R N M N P N\n   W F L M L E\n   Z W C Z J I\n   ```\n\n2. **Identifying Squares**: We need to find a 3x3 or larger square. By examining the matrix, we can see that the character 'L' forms a 3x3 square starting at (4, 2) and ending at (6, 4).\n\n3. **Verification**: The square is composed of the character 'L' and is located at:\n   - Top-left corner: (4, 2)\n   - Bottom-right corner: (6, 4)\n\nThis confirms that the code execution result is correct. The bottom-right corner of the largest square is indeed at position (6, 4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 4]>>>"
