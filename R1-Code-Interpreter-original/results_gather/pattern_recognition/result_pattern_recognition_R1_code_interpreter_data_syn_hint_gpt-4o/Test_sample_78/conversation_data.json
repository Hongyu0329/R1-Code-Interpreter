    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's a 7x8 matrix.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of the same character starting from each position in the matrix. The minimum side length to check is 3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each position in the matrix, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each cell as a potential top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # Update the largest square found\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['V', 'J', 'Q', 'W', 'S', 'X', 'C', 'B'],\n    ['T', 'X', 'R', 'K', 'K', 'Z', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['J', 'T', 'X', 'R', 'A', 'S', 'L', 'X'],\n    ['J', 'H', 'H', 'J', 'M', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['Q', 'T', 'I', 'F', 'H', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['A', 'K', 'T', 'X', 'R', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['P', 'N', 'J', 'N', 'T', 'G', 'K', 'O']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (5, 7). This means that the square is located in the matrix with its bottom-right corner at row 5 and column 7.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of this result, let's verify the logic:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 7 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: The code checks for squares starting from each position in the matrix, with a minimum side length of 3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each position, it checks if a square of increasing size can be formed, ensuring all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Track the Largest Square**: The code keeps track of the largest square found and updates the bottom-right corner coordinates accordingly.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The final result is the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic, the result (5, 7) is consistent with the task requirements. The square with the bottom-right corner at (5, 7) is composed of the character 'P', and it forms a 3x3 square.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 7]>>>"
