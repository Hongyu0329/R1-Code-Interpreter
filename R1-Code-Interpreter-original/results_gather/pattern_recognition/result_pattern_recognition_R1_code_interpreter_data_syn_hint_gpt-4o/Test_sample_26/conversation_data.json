    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of indices we need to check.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Check for squares starting from each position\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size + 1):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size + 1):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != current_char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square:\n                    if size + 1 > max_size:\n                        max_size = size + 1\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size, j + size)\n                else:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'H', 'P', 'T', 'T', 'K', 'A', 'S'],\n    ['B', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'D', 'I', 'J', 'W'],\n    ['U', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'A', 'A', 'E', 'A'],\n    ['O', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'T', 'T', 'Y', 'S'],\n    ['D', 'M', 'Z', 'V', 'D', 'Z', 'Y', 'V'],\n    ['S', 'C', 'T', 'W', 'H', 'C', 'Z', 'P'],\n    ['K', 'M', 'N', 'Q', 'E', 'H', 'D', 'N'],\n    ['E', 'K', 'S', 'X', 'A', 'U', 'I', 'D'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'D', 'S', 'V', 'J', 'P', 'J'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'S', 'I', 'T', 'I', 'V', 'Z'],\n    ['R', 'Z', 'L', 'W', 'Y', 'J', 'D', 'E']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
