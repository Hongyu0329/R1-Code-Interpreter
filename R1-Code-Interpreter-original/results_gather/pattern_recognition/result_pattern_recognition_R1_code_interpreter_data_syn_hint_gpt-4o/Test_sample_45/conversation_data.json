    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix, which are 6 rows and 7 columns in this case.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of at least size 3x3 can fit. This means iterating from row 0 to row 3 and column 0 to column 4.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) of the same character exists. This involves checking if all characters in the 3x3 sub-matrix are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the found square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over possible top-left corners of a 3x3 square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check if a 3x3 square of the same character exists\n            char = matrix[i][j]\n            if (matrix[i][j+1] == char and matrix[i][j+2] == char and\n                matrix[i+1][j] == char and matrix[i+1][j+1] == char and matrix[i+1][j+2] == char and\n                matrix[i+2][j] == char and matrix[i+2][j+1] == char and matrix[i+2][j+2] == char):\n                # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                return [i+2, j+2]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Y', 'Y', 'J', 'F', 'J', 'V', 'M'],\n    ['C', 'O', 'D', 'K', 'W', 'M', 'P'],\n    ['F', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'A', 'O'],\n    ['U', 'P', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'X', 'H'],\n    ['F', 'R', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'J', 'Y'],\n    ['S', 'Y', 'M', 'C', 'V', 'P', 'G']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [4, 4]. This means that there is a 3x3 square of the same character in the matrix, and the bottom-right corner of this square is located at row 4, column 4.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\nY Y J F J V M\nC O D K W M P\nF B K K K A O\nU P K K K X H\nF R K K K J Y\nS Y M C V P G\n```\n\nThe 3x3 square of 'K' is located starting from row 2, column 2 to row 4, column 4. This matches the output of the code.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 4]>>>"
