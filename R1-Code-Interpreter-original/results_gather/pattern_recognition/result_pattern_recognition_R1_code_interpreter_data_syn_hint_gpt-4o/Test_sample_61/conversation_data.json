    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible square sizes and positions.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start with the largest possible square size and work downwards to a size of 3.\n   - For each possible square size, iterate over all possible top-left corners of the square.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: \n   - For each top-left corner, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n   - If a square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: \n   - Since the problem states the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square of the required size.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start with the largest possible square size and work downwards\n    for size in range(min(rows, cols), 2, -1):\n        for r in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for c in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[r][c]\n                is_square = True\n                for i in range(size):\n                    for j in range(size):\n                        if matrix[r + i][c + j] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [r + size - 1, c + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'W', 'P', 'T', 'I', 'V', 'J', 'I', 'Y'],\n    ['C', 'C', 'J', 'T', 'M', 'B', 'I', 'F', 'Y'],\n    ['Q', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'Q'],\n    ['J', 'L', 'C', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'J', 'B'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'D', 'N'],\n    ['M', 'G', 'I', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'S', 'Q'],\n    ['G', 'E', 'T', 'C', 'N', 'M', 'S', 'G', 'U'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'U', 'X', 'D', 'D', 'O', 'P', 'A'],\n    ['H', 'B', 'I', 'R', 'S', 'K', 'B', 'K', 'Z'],\n    ['U', 'N', 'W', 'Z', 'I', 'M', 'J', 'Z', 'Q'],\n    ['K', 'I', 'D', 'J', 'H', 'M', 'C', 'Y', 'R']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nprint(find_largest_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3 is at position [5, 6]. This means that there is a square of 'F' characters in the matrix, and the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 5, column 6.\n\nGiven that the problem states the answer is unique, and the code has successfully identified a square of the required size, we can conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 6]>>>"
