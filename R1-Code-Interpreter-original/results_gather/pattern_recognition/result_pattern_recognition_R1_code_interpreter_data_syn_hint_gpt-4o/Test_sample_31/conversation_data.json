    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. If a square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n4. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python code.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the matrix\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                if all(matrix[i + k][j] == matrix[i][j] for k in range(size)) and \\\n                   all(matrix[i][j + k] == matrix[i][j] for k in range(size)) and \\\n                   all(matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] == matrix[i][j] for k in range(size)) and \\\n                   all(matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] == matrix[i][j] for k in range(size)):\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'X', 'T', 'A', 'A', 'P'],\n    ['U', 'D', 'I', 'Z', 'J', 'Z'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'F', 'S', 'X', 'E'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'F', 'B', 'T', 'D'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'F', 'S', 'L', 'Q'],\n    ['O', 'I', 'X', 'V', 'H', 'Q'],\n    ['X', 'S', 'K', 'S', 'B', 'Y'],\n    ['D', 'V', 'K', 'D', 'Q', 'J'],\n    ['Q', 'Y', 'S', 'K', 'S', 'J']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the square.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [4, 2]. However, let's verify this result through reasoning to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: \n   - The matrix is a 9x6 grid.\n   - We need to find a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\n2. **Square Identification**:\n   - The square must have all its sides composed of the same character.\n   - The bottom-right corner of the square should be identified.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The code checks for squares starting from each position in the matrix.\n   - It verifies if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed with the same character.\n\n4. **Result Verification**:\n   - The code found a square with the bottom-right corner at [4, 2].\n   - Let's manually verify this by checking the matrix:\n\n   ```\n   F F F\n   F F F\n   F F F\n   ```\n\n   - The above 3x3 square is formed by the character 'F' and its bottom-right corner is indeed at [4, 2].\n\nSince the code correctly identifies the square and the manual verification confirms it, the result is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 2]>>>"
