    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for checking potential squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each cell in the matrix that can serve as the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3) can be formed with the same character. We will check if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'O', 'W', 'N', 'E', 'P', 'V', 'H'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'N', 'N', 'C'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'T', 'B', 'K', 'P', 'I', 'Q'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'T', 'Y', 'T', 'K', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['O', 'U', 'Y', 'X', 'E', 'K', 'G', 'E'],\n    ['E', 'K', 'O', 'E', 'X', 'F', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['P', 'X', 'T', 'K', 'L', 'W', 'H', 'U']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (3, 2). However, this result seems incorrect based on the problem statement, which suggests that the answer is unique and should be verified.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the approach and ensure that the logic correctly identifies the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. We need to ensure that the code checks all possible squares and correctly identifies the largest one.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n\n1. **Iterate Over Each Cell**: Consider each cell as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n2. **Check for Square Formation**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Return the bottom-right corner of the largest square.\n\nLet's refine the code to ensure it correctly identifies the largest square:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'O', 'W', 'N', 'E', 'P', 'V', 'H'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'N', 'N', 'C'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'T', 'B', 'K', 'P', 'I', 'Q'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'T', 'Y', 'T', 'K', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['O', 'U', 'Y', 'X', 'E', 'K', 'G', 'E'],\n    ['E', 'K', 'O', 'E', 'X', 'F', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['P', 'X', 'T', 'K', 'L', 'W', 'H', 'U']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code to verify the result.",
    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using code have not yielded the correct result. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning approach to identify the issue and find the correct solution.\n\n### Textual Reasoning:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: We have a 7x8 matrix. We need to find squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to manually inspect the matrix to identify any potential squares of the same character.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: Starting from each cell, we need to check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the solution is unique, so there should be only one such square.\n\n### Manual Inspection:\n\nLet's manually inspect the matrix:\n\n```\nU O W N E P V H\nT T T T T N N C\nT T T B K P I Q\nT T T Y T K H C\nO U Y X E K G E\nE K O E X F B X\nP X T K L W H U\n```\n\n- Starting from (1, 0), we have a 3x3 square of 'T':\n  ```\n  T T T\n  T T T\n  T T T\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is (3, 2).\n\n- There are no other 3x3 or larger squares of the same character in the matrix.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is indeed at position (3, 2). The previous code attempts were correct in identifying this position, but the problem statement's uniqueness condition confirms this as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 2]>>>"
