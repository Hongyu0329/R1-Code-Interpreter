    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the range of indices we need to check.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the square once it is found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Y', 'L', 'I', 'F', 'T', 'Q', 'D', 'Y', 'F', 'I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'V'],\n    ['F', 'S', 'H', 'W', 'Y', 'J', 'X', 'R', 'I', 'T', 'I', 'R', 'B', 'H'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'X', 'X', 'R', 'P', 'G', 'N', 'I', 'F', 'Q', 'T', 'N', 'A'],\n    ['D', 'T', 'C', 'N', 'U', 'V', 'G', 'E', 'D', 'E', 'J', 'Z', 'M', 'R'],\n    ['K', 'S', 'B', 'R', 'S', 'N', 'V', 'W', 'S', 'D', 'K', 'Y', 'W', 'J'],\n    ['M', 'H', 'P', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'M', 'V', 'X', 'N', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'P'],\n    ['D', 'Y', 'K', 'V', 'Q', 'H', 'N', 'U', 'A', 'X', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'A'],\n    ['Z', 'G', 'D', 'R', 'D', 'M', 'F', 'Z', 'M', 'B', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'W']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square in the matrix with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [7, 12]. This means that there is a square of at least 3x3 size with the same character, and its bottom-right corner is located at row 7, column 12.\n\nGiven that the problem states the answer is unique, and the code has successfully identified a square, we can conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 12]>>>"
