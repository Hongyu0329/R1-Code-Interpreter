    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's a 6x12 matrix.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'L', 'F', 'T', 'H', 'P', 'R', 'T', 'F', 'U', 'W', 'B'],\n    ['R', 'A', 'Q', 'O', 'U', 'H', 'Z', 'I', 'H', 'S', 'E', 'D'],\n    ['K', 'A', 'Z', 'O', 'Z', 'Q', 'K', 'J', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'D'],\n    ['L', 'O', 'Q', 'X', 'M', 'J', 'S', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'G'],\n    ['R', 'C', 'U', 'J', 'A', 'I', 'D', 'Q', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'H'],\n    ['G', 'D', 'J', 'E', 'P', 'L', 'H', 'L', 'Q', 'O', 'C', 'U']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [4, 10]. However, let's ensure that the solution is correct by verifying the logic and the result.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 6 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: The code checks for squares starting from size 3x3 and increases the size until it finds a valid square.\n\n3. **Uniformity Check**: For each potential square, it checks if all characters are the same.\n\n4. **Result**: The code returns the bottom-right corner of the first valid square it finds.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic, the result [4, 10] suggests that there is a square of the same character 'I' starting from [2, 8] to [4, 10]. Let's confirm this by checking the matrix:\n\n- The sub-matrix from [2, 8] to [4, 10] is:\n  ```\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  ```\n\nThis confirms that the square is valid and the bottom-right corner is indeed at [4, 10].\n\nSince the logic and the result are consistent with the problem requirements, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 10]>>>"
