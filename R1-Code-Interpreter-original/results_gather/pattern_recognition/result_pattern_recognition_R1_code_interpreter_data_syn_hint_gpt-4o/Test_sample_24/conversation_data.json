    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of indices we need to check.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Minimum side length of the square\n    min_side = 3\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of the square\n    for i in range(rows - min_side + 1):\n        for j in range(cols - min_side + 1):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from min_side\n            for side in range(min_side, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the current square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner\n                if is_square:\n                    bottom_right = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n    \n    return bottom_right\n\n# Given character matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'N', 'M', 'K', 'W', 'Y', 'O', 'F'],\n    ['B', 'U', 'C', 'Y', 'K', 'F', 'S', 'S'],\n    ['I', 'M', 'P', 'M', 'K', 'Q', 'V', 'L'],\n    ['Z', 'L', 'U', 'B', 'Q', 'D', 'I', 'Q'],\n    ['E', 'Z', 'W', 'H', 'E', 'A', 'V', 'C'],\n    ['A', 'P', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'A', 'R'],\n    ['L', 'F', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'U', 'W'],\n    ['P', 'F', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'G', 'C'],\n    ['S', 'M', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'H', 'T'],\n    ['Q', 'P', 'S', 'Z', 'C', 'K', 'K', 'Y'],\n    ['L', 'L', 'O', 'N', 'O', 'G', 'A', 'A'],\n    ['W', 'Z', 'G', 'S', 'F', 'Z', 'V', 'A'],\n    ['P', 'X', 'P', 'P', 'X', 'N', 'N', 'X'],\n    ['Z', 'G', 'Z', 'Q', 'K', 'S', 'Y', 'B']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nbottom_right_corner = find_square(matrix)\nprint(bottom_right_corner)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position (8, 5). However, let's ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique solution by reviewing the logic and confirming the result.\n\n### Review and Verification:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 14 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: The code iterates over each possible top-left corner and checks for squares of increasing size, starting from the minimum side length of 3.\n\n3. **Uniformity Check**: For each potential square, it checks if all characters are the same.\n\n4. **Recording the Bottom-Right Corner**: The code records the bottom-right corner of the largest valid square found.\n\n5. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect only one valid square of the required size.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic, the code correctly identifies the bottom-right corner of the square composed of the character 'Y' with a side length of 4, starting from row 5, column 2 to row 8, column 5.\n\nThe result (8, 5) is consistent with the expected output based on the matrix provided.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 5]>>>"
