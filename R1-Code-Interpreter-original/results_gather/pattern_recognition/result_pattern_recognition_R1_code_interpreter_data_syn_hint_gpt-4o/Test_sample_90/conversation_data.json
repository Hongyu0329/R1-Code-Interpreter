    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, i.e., the number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit. This means iterating from the top-left corner to a point where a 3x3 square can still fit within the matrix bounds.\n\n3. **Check for Uniform Squares**: For each starting point, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) is composed of the same character. This involves checking all characters in the square to ensure they are identical.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for possible square sizes starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'L', 'M', 'W', 'Y', 'Q', 'C', 'P', 'Z', 'X', 'J', 'M'],\n    ['A', 'I', 'L', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'X', 'H', 'V', 'B'],\n    ['Q', 'I', 'G', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'M', 'R', 'G', 'T'],\n    ['D', 'K', 'V', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Z', 'U', 'C', 'R'],\n    ['H', 'W', 'S', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'N', 'U', 'T', 'E'],\n    ['N', 'T', 'C', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'V', 'L', 'E', 'Z'],\n    ['S', 'V', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'Y', 'M', 'Q', 'S', 'N', 'P', 'E'],\n    ['M', 'D', 'U', 'L', 'P', 'V', 'G', 'N', 'K', 'X', 'Y', 'P'],\n    ['N', 'T', 'Y', 'D', 'R', 'D', 'V', 'K', 'U', 'L', 'K', 'F'],\n    ['V', 'X', 'P', 'A', 'F', 'H', 'O', 'B', 'W', 'U', 'K', 'K'],\n    ['E', 'P', 'E', 'J', 'Z', 'P', 'F', 'O', 'L', 'N', 'F', 'T'],\n    ['G', 'A', 'A', 'X', 'M', 'R', 'K', 'P', 'P', 'A', 'C', 'P']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (5, 7). This result is consistent with the problem's requirement to find the unique square in the matrix.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the solution, let's verify the logic:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12x12, which allows for multiple potential squares of size 3x3 or larger.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: The code iterates over each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit.\n\n3. **Check for Uniform Squares**: For each starting point, the code checks if a square of increasing size is composed of the same character. This involves checking all characters in the square to ensure they are identical.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, the code records the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The code outputs the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic implemented, the result (5, 7) is indeed the correct position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 7]>>>"
