    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, verify that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the identified square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need to find the largest square with side length at least 3\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'P', 'U', 'S', 'N', 'S', 'A'],\n    ['L', 'C', 'S', 'P', 'E', 'X', 'M'],\n    ['I', 'F', 'Z', 'C', 'A', 'K', 'S'],\n    ['Y', 'E', 'C', 'H', 'B', 'M', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'C', 'F', 'C', 'C', 'Q', 'F'],\n    ['R', 'J', 'F', 'M', 'X', 'X', 'K'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'U', 'Q', 'M'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'K', 'F'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'U', 'P', 'D'],\n    ['Q', 'L', 'F', 'A', 'R', 'W', 'K'],\n    ['X', 'P', 'A', 'X', 'I', 'U', 'Z'],\n    ['T', 'Z', 'U', 'X', 'P', 'B', 'F']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [8, 2]. However, let's ensure that this result is correct by reviewing the logic and considering the matrix structure.\n\n### Review and Verification:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: The code checks for squares starting from size 3x3 and iterates over possible top-left corners. It verifies if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**: The code returns the bottom-right corner of the first valid square it finds.\n\nGiven the matrix, the code correctly identifies a 3x3 square of 'I's starting at row 6, column 0, and ending at row 8, column 2. This matches the output [8, 2].\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe code has correctly identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3. The result is consistent with the matrix structure and the problem requirements.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 2]>>>"
