    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Square Detection**: Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each position, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, calculate the position of its bottom-right corner.\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from 3x3 squares\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if the square of size (size+1)x(size+1) is valid\n                valid_square = True\n                for k in range(size + 1):\n                    if matrix[i + size][j + k] != current_char or matrix[i + k][j + size] != current_char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    size += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            # Update the largest square found\n            if size > max_size:\n                max_size = size\n                bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'Y', 'R', 'Z', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'E'],\n    ['H', 'S', 'Z', 'Z', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'C'],\n    ['H', 'H', 'O', 'Z', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'U'],\n    ['C', 'O', 'C', 'B', 'E', 'O', 'Q', 'D'],\n    ['S', 'W', 'F', 'W', 'N', 'R', 'R', 'G'],\n    ['Y', 'V', 'A', 'W', 'O', 'J', 'D', 'W'],\n    ['L', 'N', 'U', 'I', 'T', 'G', 'A', 'Z']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (2, 6). This means that the square is formed by the character 'D' in the matrix, and the square is 3x3 in size.\n\nLet's verify this by examining the matrix:\n\n```\nU Y R Z D D D E\nH S Z Z D D D C\nH H O Z D D D U\nC O C B E O Q D\nS W F W N R R G\nY V A W O J D W\nL N U I T G A Z\n```\n\nThe square with the bottom-right corner at (2, 6) is:\n\n```\nD D D\nD D D\nD D D\n```\n\nThis is indeed a 3x3 square composed of the character 'D'. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, this is the correct solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 6]>>>"
