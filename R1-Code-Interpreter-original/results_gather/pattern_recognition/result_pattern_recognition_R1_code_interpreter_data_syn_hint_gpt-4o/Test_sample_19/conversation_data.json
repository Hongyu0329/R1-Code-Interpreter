    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the range of indices we need to check.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character. We will iterate over possible square sizes and check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square once found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'L', 'H', 'E', 'X', 'Q', 'Y', 'D', 'Y', 'B', 'E', 'F'],\n    ['L', 'I', 'A', 'M', 'B', 'G', 'X', 'C', 'N', 'J', 'V', 'W'],\n    ['C', 'Q', 'W', 'N', 'F', 'A', 'B', 'U', 'O', 'P', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['F', 'O', 'K', 'I', 'L', 'A', 'Z', 'F', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'G'],\n    ['I', 'V', 'S', 'Q', 'N', 'T', 'M', 'C', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'E'],\n    ['G', 'T', 'V', 'P', 'K', 'H', 'G', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'I']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 composed of the same character. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [5, 10]. This means that there is a square of at least 3x3 size composed of the same character, and its bottom-right corner is located at row 5, column 10.\n\nGiven that the problem states the answer is unique, and the code has successfully identified a square, we can conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 10]>>>"
