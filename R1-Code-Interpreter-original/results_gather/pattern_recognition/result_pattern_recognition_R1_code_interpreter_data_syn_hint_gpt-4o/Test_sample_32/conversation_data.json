    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are interested in finding the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can directly output the result once found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the current square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, return the bottom-right corner\n                if is_square:\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['F', 'P', 'F', 'Y', 'F', 'H', 'X', 'U', 'E', 'W', 'R', 'Z', 'C'],\n    ['O', 'M', 'G', 'M', 'J', 'E', 'A', 'G', 'R', 'B', 'C', 'Z', 'U'],\n    ['K', 'Z', 'Q', 'Z', 'K', 'F', 'F', 'X', 'Q', 'S', 'B', 'B', 'B'],\n    ['D', 'W', 'W', 'A', 'G', 'U', 'U', 'M', 'X', 'Q', 'B', 'B', 'B'],\n    ['Y', 'W', 'C', 'F', 'Q', 'F', 'X', 'Q', 'W', 'X', 'B', 'B', 'B'],\n    ['R', 'N', 'V', 'R', 'P', 'K', 'Q', 'Q', 'S', 'W', 'M', 'W', 'I'],\n    ['G', 'Q', 'N', 'A', 'E', 'H', 'R', 'B', 'O', 'U', 'N', 'N', 'J']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over the matrix, checking for squares of uniform characters, and return the bottom-right corner of the first valid square found. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [4, 12]. However, we need to ensure that this result is correct and that the code efficiently finds the correct square.\n\n### Review and Optimization\n\n1. **Review the Code Logic**: The code iterates over each possible top-left corner of a square and checks for squares of increasing size. It verifies if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n2. **Efficiency Considerations**: The current approach checks each possible square starting from size 3x3. This is a brute-force method and may not be the most efficient for larger matrices. However, given the constraints and the matrix size, it should be sufficient.\n\n3. **Verification**: We need to verify that the result [4, 12] is indeed the bottom-right corner of a valid square of at least size 3x3.\n\n### Verification Process\n\nLet's manually verify the result by checking the matrix:\n\n- The matrix has a 3x3 square of 'B' characters starting at position [2, 10] and ending at [4, 12].\n- This matches the result given by the code.\n\nSince the code correctly identifies the square and the result is verified, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe code correctly identifies the bottom-right corner of the square in the matrix. The result is verified to be accurate.\n\n<<<[4, 12]>>>"
