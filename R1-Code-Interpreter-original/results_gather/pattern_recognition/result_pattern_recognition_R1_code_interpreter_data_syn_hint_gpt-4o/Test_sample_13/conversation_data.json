    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for our search.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Validation**: For each potential square, validate that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the detected square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need at least a 3x3 matrix to form a square of side 3\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Record the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    bottom_right = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n                    return bottom_right\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'Y', 'A', 'D', 'H', 'G', 'C', 'P', 'H', 'F', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'F'],\n    ['X', 'K', 'G', 'F', 'T', 'E', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'Y', 'H', 'N', 'J', 'R', 'P'],\n    ['V', 'L', 'B', 'F', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'H', 'O', 'N', 'O', 'R', 'H'],\n    ['E', 'N', 'G', 'U', 'Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'W', 'J', 'O', 'M', 'V', 'F'],\n    ['J', 'E', 'M', 'F', 'U', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'Y', 'B', 'T', 'F', 'E'],\n    ['D', 'R', 'A', 'H', 'R', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'X', 'R', 'M', 'I', 'S', 'R'],\n    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'C', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'R', 'F', 'F', 'K', 'L', 'Y', 'G', 'N'],\n    ['P', 'R', 'X', 'Y', 'M', 'G', 'W', 'L', 'G', 'A', 'R', 'B', 'G', 'I', 'F']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the square\nresult = find_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (4, 7). However, let's ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique solution by reviewing the logic and confirming the result.\n\n### Review and Verification\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8 rows by 15 columns, which is sufficient to contain squares of size 3x3 or larger.\n\n2. **Square Detection Logic**: The code iterates over each possible top-left corner of a square and checks for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3. It verifies that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Result Verification**: The code returns the bottom-right corner of the first valid square it finds. Given the matrix, the square of 'I' characters starting at (2, 5) and ending at (4, 7) is indeed a valid 3x3 square.\n\n4. **Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, and the code is designed to return the first valid square it finds. Given the matrix, this is the only square of 'I' characters with a side length of at least 3.\n\nSince the logic and result are consistent with the problem requirements, the output (4, 7) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 7]>>>"
