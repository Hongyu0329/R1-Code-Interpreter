    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify if all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will return the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for potential squares with side length >= 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'Q', 'P', 'W', 'M', 'D', 'P', 'W'],\n    ['O', 'S', 'C', 'T', 'A', 'O', 'Y', 'B'],\n    ['F', 'M', 'Q', 'Q', 'L', 'I', 'S', 'R'],\n    ['K', 'Y', 'D', 'P', 'B', 'W', 'E', 'A'],\n    ['O', 'I', 'C', 'U', 'X', 'S', 'H', 'I'],\n    ['R', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'C', 'L', 'T', 'I'],\n    ['K', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'G', 'Z', 'E', 'W'],\n    ['X', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'L', 'Z', 'M', 'D'],\n    ['S', 'W', 'O', 'X', 'E', 'V', 'H', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'I', 'W', 'J', 'O', 'I', 'Z'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'N', 'W', 'S'],\n    ['L', 'D', 'X', 'Q', 'O', 'T', 'C', 'N']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (7, 3). However, let's ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique answer by reviewing the logic and confirming the result.\n\nThe approach used in the code is to iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square and check for squares of increasing size, ensuring all characters in the square are the same. The largest valid square found is recorded.\n\nGiven the matrix, let's verify the result:\n\n1. The matrix has a section of 'H' characters starting at (5, 1) and forming a 3x3 square with the bottom-right corner at (7, 3).\n2. This is the only section in the matrix that forms a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, and the code correctly identifies this square, the result is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 3]>>>"
