    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify if all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'Y', 'V', 'F', 'O', 'X', 'U', 'Q', 'Y'],\n    ['B', 'Y', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'Z', 'Y', 'F', 'X', 'G', 'G', 'Z', 'M', 'I'],\n    ['L', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'J', 'L', 'M', 'S', 'U', 'G', 'E', 'T', 'X'],\n    ['B', 'S', 'T', 'R', 'E', 'U', 'S', 'A', 'O', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'X', 'A'],\n    ['N', 'F', 'T', 'S', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'C', 'W', 'Q', 'V', 'T', 'A', 'H'],\n    ['T', 'D', 'V', 'U', 'H', 'M', 'E', 'H', 'S', 'Q', 'Q', 'R', 'Z', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the first square with a side length of at least 3 in the matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [2, 4]. This means that there is a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3, and its bottom-right corner is located at row 2, column 4 in the matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix and the problem statement, this result seems consistent with the requirement to find a square of at least 3x3 size. The code correctly identifies the first such square and returns its bottom-right corner.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n<<<[2, 4]>>>"
