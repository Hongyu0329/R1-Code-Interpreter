    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for searching squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = min(rows, cols)\n    largest_square = None\n\n    for size in range(3, max_size + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    largest_square = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return largest_square\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'Y', 'V', 'W', 'J', 'I', 'N', 'D', 'X', 'X', 'D'],\n    ['U', 'E', 'T', 'X', 'Y', 'D', 'K', 'C', 'T', 'O', 'I'],\n    ['E', 'G', 'Y', 'A', 'D', 'E', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'R'],\n    ['Q', 'B', 'N', 'T', 'O', 'O', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'I'],\n    ['U', 'K', 'H', 'U', 'Y', 'Q', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'K'],\n    ['T', 'L', 'I', 'A', 'T', 'M', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y'],\n    ['J', 'A', 'W', 'C', 'I', 'Z', 'N', 'U', 'D', 'T', 'G'],\n    ['K', 'L', 'R', 'U', 'K', 'L', 'A', 'Z', 'Y', 'C', 'K'],\n    ['Z', 'S', 'J', 'R', 'T', 'R', 'X', 'V', 'M', 'Z', 'Q'],\n    ['M', 'W', 'W', 'A', 'C', 'Y', 'S', 'V', 'G', 'W', 'T']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (5, 9). However, let's ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique answer by reviewing the logic and confirming the result.\n\n### Review of the Logic:\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 11 columns.\n2. **Square Size**: We are looking for squares with a minimum size of 3x3.\n3. **Uniformity Check**: For each potential square, we check if all characters are the same.\n4. **Recording the Bottom-Right Corner**: We record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\n### Verification:\n- The code iterates over all possible starting points for squares of increasing size.\n- It checks for uniformity within each square.\n- It updates the largest square found and records its bottom-right corner.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic, the result (5, 9) seems to be the correct bottom-right corner of the largest square of uniform characters. The square is composed of the character 'Y' and is located in the lower part of the matrix.\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, and the code has correctly identified a square of uniform characters, we can conclude that the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 9]>>>"
