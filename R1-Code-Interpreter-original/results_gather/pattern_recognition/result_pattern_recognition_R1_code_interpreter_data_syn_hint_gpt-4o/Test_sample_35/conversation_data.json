    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for our search.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner of a square can be any cell in the matrix, but we need to ensure that there is enough space to form a square of at least size 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corners**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for possible square sizes starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'W', 'Z', 'P', 'S', 'V', 'Q', 'C'],\n    ['E', 'S', 'E', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'I'],\n    ['A', 'S', 'M', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'J'],\n    ['R', 'G', 'B', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'U'],\n    ['A', 'A', 'X', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'M'],\n    ['R', 'C', 'U', 'C', 'V', 'B', 'A', 'D'],\n    ['P', 'T', 'R', 'Q', 'D', 'O', 'N', 'W'],\n    ['R', 'B', 'E', 'X', 'O', 'L', 'M', 'M'],\n    ['M', 'G', 'F', 'J', 'W', 'N', 'Q', 'N'],\n    ['X', 'N', 'P', 'M', 'Y', 'N', 'X', 'D'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'C', 'H', 'C', 'K'],\n    ['L', 'X', 'C', 'W', 'U', 'J', 'K', 'F'],\n    ['Q', 'J', 'M', 'V', 'Q', 'H', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['K', 'O', 'C', 'E', 'S', 'R', 'P', 'E']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (4, 6). This means that the square is located in the matrix with its bottom-right corner at row 4 and column 6.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of this result, let's verify the logic:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 14 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: The code iterates over each cell in the matrix as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, the code checks for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3, ensuring all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corners**: If a valid square is found, the code records the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: The code outputs the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nThe code correctly identifies the largest square of identical characters in the matrix, which is composed of the character 'G' and has its bottom-right corner at (4, 6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 6]>>>"
