    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, the matrix is 10 rows by 11 columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Square Sizes**: Since we are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, we will start checking from size 3 up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Check for Uniform Squares**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square boundaries.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_square_size = min(rows, cols)\n    \n    for size in range(3, max_square_size + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'X', 'O', 'F', 'I', 'Y', 'C', 'K', 'K', 'A', 'I'],\n    ['B', 'G', 'Z', 'H', 'X', 'X', 'J', 'A', 'P', 'V', 'B'],\n    ['K', 'T', 'B', 'A', 'F', 'W', 'T', 'N', 'Y', 'X', 'T'],\n    ['H', 'F', 'L', 'Q', 'W', 'J', 'S', 'I', 'Q', 'H', 'L'],\n    ['Y', 'I', 'Q', 'R', 'Z', 'F', 'K', 'U', 'L', 'R', 'C'],\n    ['X', 'F', 'K', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'N', 'X', 'H', 'K'],\n    ['D', 'L', 'U', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'X', 'L', 'Z', 'E'],\n    ['S', 'H', 'G', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'V', 'Z', 'R', 'Y'],\n    ['O', 'M', 'X', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'W', 'M', 'I', 'R'],\n    ['P', 'O', 'C', 'O', 'I', 'N', 'F', 'S', 'M', 'V', 'Y']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nprint(find_largest_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [7, 5]. This means that there is a square of identical characters with its bottom-right corner at this position.\n\nLet's verify the result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is 10 rows by 11 columns. We need to find squares of identical characters with a minimum side length of 3.\n\n2. **Identifying the Square**: The code found a square with the bottom-right corner at [7, 5]. Let's check the characters around this position:\n   - The characters from [5, 3] to [7, 5] are all 'J', forming a 3x3 square:\n     ```\n     J J J\n     J J J\n     J J J\n     ```\n\n3. **Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, and the code found a valid 3x3 square. Therefore, this should be the correct and unique solution.\n\nGiven this analysis, the result seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 5]>>>"
