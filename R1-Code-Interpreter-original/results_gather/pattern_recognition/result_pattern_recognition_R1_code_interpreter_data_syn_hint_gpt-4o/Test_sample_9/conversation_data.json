    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, we need to determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, the matrix is 10x10.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. For each potential top-left corner of a square, we will check if a square of a given size can be formed.\n\n3. **Character Consistency**: For a square to be valid, all characters on the edges of the square must be the same.\n\n4. **Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, we record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    n = len(matrix)\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, n - max(i, j) + 1):\n                if all(matrix[i][j] == matrix[i + k][j] == matrix[i][j + k] == matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] == matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] for k in range(size)):\n                    if size > max_size:\n                        max_size = size\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n    \n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'D', 'H', 'X', 'Q', 'G', 'D', 'V', 'E', 'S'],\n    ['E', 'H', 'Y', 'T', 'D', 'Y', 'R', 'T', 'N', 'M'],\n    ['K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'A', 'M', 'E', 'M', 'M', 'K'],\n    ['K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'E', 'W', 'X', 'D', 'L', 'N'],\n    ['K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'Z', 'D', 'U', 'D', 'T', 'N'],\n    ['K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'Y', 'N', 'V', 'J', 'V', 'F'],\n    ['Z', 'C', 'T', 'J', 'M', 'G', 'V', 'D', 'X', 'P'],\n    ['G', 'D', 'A', 'J', 'R', 'U', 'Y', 'H', 'K', 'L'],\n    ['S', 'U', 'N', 'E', 'R', 'A', 'Y', 'X', 'N', 'Y'],\n    ['K', 'Q', 'I', 'O', 'P', 'N', 'R', 'G', 'N', 'V']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (5, 3). However, we need to ensure that this result is correct and that the code efficiently identifies the largest square with a side length of at least 3.\n\nLet's review the logic and ensure that the code correctly identifies squares by checking all possible squares in the matrix. The code should iterate over each possible top-left corner and check for squares of increasing size, ensuring that all edges of the square are composed of the same character.\n\nThe current code seems to be correct in terms of logic, but let's verify the result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix has a clear 4x4 square of 'K' characters starting at position (2, 0) and ending at position (5, 3). This is the largest square with a side length of at least 3.\n\n2. **Verification**: The square is composed of 'K' characters, and all edges are consistent.\n\nGiven this analysis, the result of (5, 3) is indeed the correct bottom-right corner of the largest square.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 3]>>>"
