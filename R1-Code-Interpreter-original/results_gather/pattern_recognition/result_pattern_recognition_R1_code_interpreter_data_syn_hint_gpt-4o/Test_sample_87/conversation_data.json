    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for our search.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square of the required size.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'N', 'G', 'F', 'I', 'M', 'O'],\n    ['I', 'U', 'G', 'I', 'C', 'S', 'V'],\n    ['I', 'N', 'U', 'Z', 'R', 'Y', 'C'],\n    ['V', 'V', 'Y', 'A', 'G', 'O', 'R'],\n    ['Y', 'N', 'Z', 'Y', 'D', 'M', 'V'],\n    ['P', 'W', 'S', 'X', 'C', 'E', 'K'],\n    ['Q', 'B', 'W', 'P', 'O', 'A', 'D'],\n    ['N', 'Z', 'C', 'P', 'T', 'C', 'N'],\n    ['J', 'A', 'M', 'Z', 'H', 'E', 'J'],\n    ['S', 'Q', 'O', 'Z', 'B', 'P', 'B'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'U', 'C', 'C', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'J', 'U', 'R'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'L', 'R', 'H']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through the matrix, checking for squares of increasing size, and return the bottom-right corner of the first valid square it finds. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [12, 2]. This means that there is a 3x3 square composed of the same character 'X' starting from row 10, column 0 to row 12, column 2.\n\nLet's verify this by examining the relevant part of the matrix:\n\n```\nX X X\nX X X\nX X X\n```\n\nThis 3x3 square is indeed composed of the same character 'X', and its bottom-right corner is at position [12, 2].\n\nGiven that the problem states the answer is unique, and the code has correctly identified a valid square, we can conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<[12, 2]>>>"
