    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify that all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'P', 'W', 'I', 'W', 'H', 'N'],\n    ['U', 'L', 'S', 'P', 'N', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['M', 'V', 'H', 'H', 'N', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['I', 'R', 'I', 'F', 'N', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['W', 'M', 'I', 'D', 'F', 'P', 'S'],\n    ['T', 'H', 'X', 'M', 'U', 'K', 'C'],\n    ['Y', 'A', 'W', 'N', 'L', 'P', 'H'],\n    ['O', 'V', 'I', 'S', 'N', 'Q', 'T'],\n    ['T', 'K', 'O', 'S', 'E', 'L', 'I'],\n    ['B', 'Y', 'Y', 'G', 'N', 'B', 'S'],\n    ['U', 'Y', 'E', 'E', 'M', 'W', 'J'],\n    ['W', 'O', 'C', 'C', 'V', 'L', 'W']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a square with a side length of at least 3 was found with the bottom-right corner at position [3, 6]. However, we need to ensure that this is the correct and unique solution as per the problem statement.\n\nLet's verify the logic and ensure that the code correctly identifies the square:\n\n1. The code iterates over each element in the matrix and checks for squares starting from each position.\n2. It checks for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3, and verifies if all elements in the square are the same.\n3. Once a valid square is found, it returns the position of the bottom-right corner.\n\nGiven the matrix and the result, let's manually verify if the square at [3, 6] is indeed valid:\n\n- The square starts at [1, 4] and ends at [3, 6].\n- The elements in this 3x3 square are all 'N', which confirms that it is a valid square.\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, and the code has found a valid square, we can conclude that the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 6]>>>"
