    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us iterate over the matrix and check for potential squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each cell in the matrix, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3. This involves checking if the characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_squares(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    min_side_length = 3\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares with side length >= 3\n            for side_length in range(min_side_length, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side_length):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side_length):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    result.append((i + side_length - 1, j + side_length - 1))\n    \n    # Since the answer is unique, we return the last found square's bottom-right corner\n    return result[-1]\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'G', 'H', 'D', 'K', 'T', 'M', 'T', 'X', 'T'],\n    ['X', 'N', 'B', 'F', 'Q', 'L', 'R', 'J', 'Z', 'K'],\n    ['D', 'T', 'Y', 'W', 'U', 'G', 'J', 'J', 'K', 'F'],\n    ['C', 'L', 'X', 'M', 'W', 'X', 'U', 'J', 'E', 'B'],\n    ['J', 'D', 'G', 'V', 'R', 'R', 'L', 'V', 'Z', 'N'],\n    ['I', 'P', 'T', 'M', 'B', 'L', 'U', 'T', 'F', 'B'],\n    ['Y', 'R', 'X', 'P', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'E'],\n    ['N', 'X', 'M', 'N', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['L', 'O', 'C', 'P', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'V'],\n    ['N', 'C', 'L', 'X', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'L'],\n    ['M', 'I', 'P', 'E', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'F'],\n    ['K', 'L', 'C', 'Z', 'A', 'Y', 'G', 'V', 'W', 'Z']\n]\n\nresult = find_squares(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position (10, 8). However, let's ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique solution by reviewing the logic and confirming the result.\n\n### Review and Verification\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 10 columns.\n\n2. **Square Detection Logic**: The code iterates over each cell and checks for squares starting from that cell with a side length of at least 3. It verifies if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n3. **Result**: The code collects all valid squares and returns the bottom-right corner of the last found square.\n\nGiven the matrix, the code correctly identifies the largest square of 'H' characters starting from row 6, column 4, and extending to row 10, column 8. This is indeed a 5x5 square, which is the largest possible square in the matrix.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe result (10, 8) is correct, as it represents the bottom-right corner of the largest square of identical characters with a side length of at least 3. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[10, 8]>>>"
