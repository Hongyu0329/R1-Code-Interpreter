    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for searching squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n4. **Validate Square**: Ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with (i, j) as the top-left corner\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size + 1):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size + 1):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != current_char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square:\n                    if size + 1 > max_size:\n                        max_size = size + 1\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size, j + size)\n                else:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['F', 'N', 'U', 'V', 'P', 'Q'],\n    ['C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'V', 'D'],\n    ['Y', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'R'],\n    ['Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'S', 'J'],\n    ['C', 'N', 'C', 'H', 'L', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'S', 'A', 'Z', 'Y', 'H'],\n    ['C', 'E', 'J', 'R', 'Y', 'Z'],\n    ['X', 'A', 'V', 'N', 'P', 'E'],\n    ['O', 'K', 'D', 'Q', 'Q', 'I'],\n    ['E', 'H', 'G', 'N', 'P', 'F']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (3, 3). However, let's verify this result through reasoning to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Verification through Reasoning:\n\n1. **Matrix Overview**: The matrix is a 10x6 grid. We need to find squares of at least 3x3 size.\n\n2. **Character Consistency**: A valid square must have all its sides composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Largest Square Identification**: The code checks for squares starting from each position and expands the size until it can no longer form a valid square.\n\n4. **Result Analysis**: The code found a square with the bottom-right corner at (3, 3), which corresponds to the character 'I'. Let's verify this manually:\n\n   - The square starts at (1, 1) and ends at (3, 3).\n   - The characters in this square are:\n     ```\n     I I I\n     I I I\n     I I I\n     ```\n   - All characters are 'I', confirming a valid 3x3 square.\n\n5. **Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so this should be the only valid square of this size or larger.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the result seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 3]>>>"
