    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible top-left corners of squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the square does not exceed the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Store Results**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for possible squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['J', 'A', 'L', 'T', 'O', 'H'],\n    ['Z', 'U', 'B', 'V', 'M', 'Z'],\n    ['P', 'W', 'U', 'V', 'M', 'F'],\n    ['S', 'R', 'Q', 'C', 'P', 'S'],\n    ['N', 'Y', 'O', 'Q', 'T', 'M'],\n    ['H', 'A', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'T'],\n    ['K', 'S', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'P'],\n    ['F', 'O', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'V'],\n    ['L', 'Q', 'X', 'W', 'M', 'S'],\n    ['U', 'O', 'O', 'W', 'Q', 'M'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'Q', 'V', 'Y', 'M'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'R', 'U', 'A', 'H']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (7, 4). However, let's verify this result by reasoning through the problem and ensuring the code logic is correct.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. The code iterates over each possible top-left corner and checks for squares of increasing size.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions**: The code ensures that the square does not exceed the matrix boundaries by limiting the size of the square to `min(rows - i, cols - j)`.\n\n4. **Character Consistency**: For each potential square, the code checks if all characters are the same.\n\n5. **Result Storage**: The code keeps track of the largest square found and updates the bottom-right corner coordinates accordingly.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify the result by manually checking the matrix for a square of size 3x3 or larger:\n\n- Starting from row 5, column 2, we have a 3x3 square of 'W':\n  ```\n  W W W\n  W W W\n  W W W\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (7, 4).\n\nThis matches the result obtained from the code execution. Therefore, the code logic is correct, and the result is verified.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (7, 4).\n\n<<<[7, 4]>>>"
