    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, we need to determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of indices we will be working with.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square once found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need at least a 3x3 matrix to form a square of side 3\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', 'R', 'C', 'H', 'H', 'E', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'E', 'N', 'A'],\n    ['D', 'L', 'W', 'I', 'Q', 'R', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'V', 'G', 'P'],\n    ['Y', 'D', 'R', 'J', 'L', 'D', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'R', 'Q', 'B'],\n    ['A', 'D', 'C', 'S', 'J', 'W', 'S', 'G', 'O', 'T', 'Q', 'V'],\n    ['G', 'Y', 'J', 'O', 'G', 'U', 'Z', 'C', 'H', 'E', 'H', 'G'],\n    ['I', 'H', 'X', 'N', 'R', 'M', 'Q', 'Z', 'G', 'J', 'V', 'U'],\n    ['O', 'H', 'L', 'O', 'Y', 'A', 'W', 'I', 'M', 'W', 'F', 'J']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through the matrix, checking for squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3, and return the bottom-right corner of the first such square found.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [2, 8]. Let's verify this result through reasoning and ensure that the logic is correct.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is 7 rows by 12 columns. We need to find a square of at least 3x3 with the same character.\n\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Squares**: We start from each possible top-left corner and check for squares of increasing size. The smallest square we are interested in is 3x3.\n\n3. **Checking for Uniformity**: For each potential square, we check if all characters are the same.\n\n4. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the solution is unique, so once we find a valid square, we can stop.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- The code iterates over each possible starting point for a 3x3 square.\n- It checks if all characters in the square are the same.\n- It returns the bottom-right corner of the first valid square found.\n\nGiven the matrix, the code correctly identifies the square starting at (0, 6) and ending at (2, 8) with the character 'Y'. This is indeed a 3x3 square of 'Y's, and the bottom-right corner is at (2, 8).\n\nSince the code execution result matches our expectations and the logic is sound, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<[2, 8]>>>"
