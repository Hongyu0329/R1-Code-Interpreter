    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify that all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'R', 'Z', 'K', 'I', 'V'],\n    ['C', 'J', 'H', 'B', 'Y', 'K'],\n    ['B', 'L', 'L', 'Q', 'U', 'X'],\n    ['U', 'O', 'R', 'Q', 'T', 'R'],\n    ['Z', 'E', 'L', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'J', 'J', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['C', 'Y', 'M', 'O', 'O', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the square.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a square was found with the bottom-right corner at position [6, 5]. However, we need to ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique square with a side length of at least 3. Let's verify the logic and ensure that the code correctly identifies the square.\n\nThe approach involves checking each possible top-left corner of a square and verifying if a square of the same character can be formed. The code iterates over each element and checks for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3. If a valid square is found, it returns the bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's review the logic and ensure it is correctly implemented:\n\n1. The code iterates over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, it checks for squares starting from size 3x3.\n3. It verifies that all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, it returns the bottom-right corner.\n\nThe code seems to be logically correct, but let's ensure that the matrix and the logic are correctly implemented. The matrix is:\n\n```\nG R Z K I V\nC J H B Y K\nB L L Q U X\nU O R Q T R\nZ E L O O O\nX J J O O O\nC Y M O O O\n```\n\nThe square found is composed of 'O' characters, and the bottom-right corner is at [6, 5]. Let's verify this by checking the matrix manually:\n\n- The square starts at [4, 3] and ends at [6, 5].\n- The elements in this square are all 'O'.\n\nThis confirms that the square is valid. Therefore, the result is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 5]>>>"
