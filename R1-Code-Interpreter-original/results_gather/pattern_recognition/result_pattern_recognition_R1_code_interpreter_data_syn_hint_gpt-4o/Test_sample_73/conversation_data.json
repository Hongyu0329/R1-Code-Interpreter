    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the range of indices we need to check for potential squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_side = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check possible square sizes starting from 3\n            for side in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and side > max_side:\n                    max_side = side\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'E', 'H', 'Q', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'X'],\n    ['Q', 'T', 'T', 'B', 'V', 'Q', 'N', 'U'],\n    ['G', 'T', 'Y', 'N', 'W', 'W', 'D', 'Y'],\n    ['S', 'X', 'L', 'O', 'O', 'G', 'X', 'S'],\n    ['A', 'F', 'Y', 'S', 'Z', 'Z', 'K', 'A'],\n    ['Z', 'N', 'T', 'A', 'D', 'K', 'J', 'M'],\n    ['L', 'S', 'W', 'B', 'R', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['O', 'M', 'X', 'K', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['I', 'Y', 'G', 'P', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['H', 'J', 'G', 'T', 'O', 'Z', 'Z', 'X'],\n    ['W', 'Y', 'J', 'Z', 'G', 'H', 'N', 'D'],\n    ['D', 'C', 'K', 'B', 'W', 'H', 'F', 'P'],\n    ['P', 'B', 'X', 'H', 'O', 'W', 'R', 'H'],\n    ['Y', 'I', 'A', 'S', 'T', 'G', 'U', 'V']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (8, 7). However, let's verify this result through reasoning to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Verification Process:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 14 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3 that are composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Check the Result**: The result (8, 7) suggests a square with the bottom-right corner at row 8, column 7. Let's verify if this is indeed a valid square.\n\n4. **Character Consistency**: The character at (8, 7) is 'C'. We need to check if there is a 3x3 or larger square ending at this position with all 'C's.\n\n5. **Square Verification**: \n   - Check the 3x3 square with the bottom-right corner at (8, 7):\n     ```\n     C C C\n     C C C\n     C C C\n     ```\n   - This is a valid 3x3 square composed entirely of 'C's.\n\n6. **Larger Squares**: Check if a larger square can be formed:\n   - A 4x4 square would require checking additional rows and columns, which are not available in this case.\n\nSince the 3x3 square is valid and no larger square can be formed, the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is indeed at position (8, 7).\n\n<<<[8, 7]>>>"
