    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's a 15x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from size 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is found, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['J', 'H', 'E', 'U', 'I', 'L', 'V', 'R', 'D'],\n    ['G', 'A', 'S', 'N', 'G', 'N', 'P', 'M', 'K'],\n    ['Z', 'H', 'Z', 'F', 'Z', 'L', 'R', 'B', 'C'],\n    ['E', 'P', 'R', 'P', 'T', 'J', 'B', 'N', 'A'],\n    ['S', 'U', 'A', 'L', 'X', 'U', 'A', 'P', 'V'],\n    ['N', 'H', 'R', 'T', 'P', 'B', 'L', 'Y', 'M'],\n    ['U', 'O', 'X', 'D', 'E', 'J', 'Q', 'X', 'E'],\n    ['W', 'O', 'M', 'E', 'W', 'Q', 'H', 'J', 'H'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'D', 'F', 'T', 'N', 'I', 'E', 'V'],\n    ['C', 'I', 'Z', 'U', 'Y', 'L', 'M', 'Y', 'W'],\n    ['Y', 'T', 'W', 'Q', 'K', 'T', 'G', 'O', 'N'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'P', 'G', 'H', 'X', 'C', 'L'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'K', 'A', 'X', 'A', 'K', 'T'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'Y', 'I', 'H', 'I', 'B', 'T'],\n    ['R', 'G', 'G', 'S', 'I', 'W', 'P', 'V', 'S']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nprint(find_largest_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (13, 2). However, we need to ensure that this result is correct and that the square is indeed composed of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\nLet's verify the result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: We need to check the matrix visually or through code to ensure that the square at (13, 2) is valid and the largest.\n\n2. **Character Consistency**: The square should be composed of the same character. In this case, the character 'X' is repeated in the rows 11, 12, and 13, and columns 0, 1, and 2.\n\n3. **Square Size**: The square should have a side length of at least 3. The coordinates (13, 2) suggest a 3x3 square with the top-left corner at (11, 0).\n\nLet's verify this by checking the matrix manually:\n\n- The sub-matrix from (11, 0) to (13, 2) is:\n  ```\n  X X X\n  X X X\n  X X X\n  ```\n\nThis confirms that the square is valid and composed of the same character 'X'. Therefore, the result is correct.\n\nNow, let's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<[13, 2]>>>"
