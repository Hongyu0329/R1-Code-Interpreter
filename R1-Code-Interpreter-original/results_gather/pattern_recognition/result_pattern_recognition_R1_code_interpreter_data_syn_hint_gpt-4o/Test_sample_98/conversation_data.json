    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, i.e., the number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each top-left corner, we will check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['A', 'O', 'B', 'P', 'P', 'A', 'X', 'C', 'A', 'D', 'Q', 'J', 'F'],\n    ['I', 'Z', 'T', 'H', 'D', 'V', 'T', 'T', 'Q', 'M', 'T', 'W', 'S'],\n    ['U', 'L', 'H', 'O', 'E', 'R', 'K', 'P', 'Z', 'P', 'C', 'H', 'A'],\n    ['S', 'H', 'P', 'N', 'Z', 'B', 'D', 'P', 'C', 'K', 'G', 'B', 'T'],\n    ['G', 'F', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'Q', 'K', 'A', 'O', 'U', 'O', 'F', 'E'],\n    ['P', 'C', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'G', 'M', 'H', 'Y', 'J', 'R', 'J', 'K'],\n    ['G', 'L', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'I', 'I', 'J', 'W', 'W', 'P', 'I', 'Q']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (6, 4). However, let's verify this result by reasoning through the problem and ensuring the code logic is correct.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix has 7 rows and 13 columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to check each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each top-left corner, we will check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, we need to ensure all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify the result by checking the matrix manually for any 3x3 or larger squares composed of the same character:\n\n- Starting from row 4, column 2, we have a 3x3 square of 'O's:\n  ```\n  O O O\n  O O O\n  O O O\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (6, 4).\n\nThis confirms that the result from the code is correct. The bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is indeed at position (6, 4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 4]>>>"
