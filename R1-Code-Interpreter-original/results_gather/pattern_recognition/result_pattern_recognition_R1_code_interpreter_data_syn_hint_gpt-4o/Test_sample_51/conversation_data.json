    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, we need to determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_squares(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    min_size = 3\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(min_size, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    result.append((i + size - 1, j + size - 1))\n    \n    # Since the answer is unique, we assume the largest square is the one we need\n    return result[-1] if result else None\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['D', 'D', 'L', 'C', 'F', 'G', 'U', 'H', 'H', 'P', 'Q', 'O'],\n    ['P', 'N', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'C', 'H', 'A', 'Z', 'K', 'J'],\n    ['V', 'K', 'L', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'K', 'U', 'K', 'M', 'L', 'O'],\n    ['N', 'G', 'R', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'E', 'E', 'H', 'F', 'Z', 'W'],\n    ['I', 'A', 'D', 'Z', 'C', 'E', 'G', 'D', 'E', 'A', 'G', 'A'],\n    ['H', 'H', 'H', 'T', 'N', 'L', 'S', 'V', 'F', 'W', 'T', 'V'],\n    ['L', 'T', 'U', 'J', 'T', 'B', 'W', 'I', 'Q', 'Q', 'N', 'S']\n]\n\nresult = find_squares(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position (3, 5). However, let's ensure that the solution is correct by verifying the logic and the result.\n\n### Verification and Reasoning\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 7 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We are looking for squares of at least 3x3 size. The code iterates over each possible top-left corner and checks for squares of increasing size.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**: The result (3, 5) suggests that there is a square with the bottom-right corner at row 3, column 5. This corresponds to a square starting at (1, 3) with a size of 3x3, filled with the character 'A'.\n\n4. **Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so this should be the only valid square of at least 3x3 size.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic, the result seems consistent with the problem requirements. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 5]>>>"
