    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us in iterating through the matrix.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Matrix**: We will iterate through each element of the matrix and check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square can be formed with the same character. We will check squares of increasing size starting from 3x3.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Function to check if a square of size `size` can be formed starting at (r, c)\n    def is_square(r, c, size):\n        char = matrix[r][c]\n        for i in range(size):\n            for j in range(size):\n                if matrix[r + i][c + j] != char:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            size = 3\n            while r + size <= rows and c + size <= cols:\n                if is_square(r, c, size):\n                    # If a square is found, record the bottom-right corner\n                    bottom_right = (r + size - 1, c + size - 1)\n                size += 1\n    \n    return bottom_right\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'X', 'I', 'R', 'T', 'M', 'J', 'C', 'W', 'A', 'Z'],\n    ['G', 'U', 'P', 'M', 'T', 'U', 'E', 'V', 'G', 'I', 'M'],\n    ['E', 'C', 'L', 'V', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'F', 'T', 'K', 'L'],\n    ['A', 'J', 'M', 'W', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'Q', 'T', 'O', 'P'],\n    ['C', 'E', 'U', 'X', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'X', 'A', 'U', 'G'],\n    ['O', 'L', 'H', 'F', 'F', 'O', 'Y', 'Y', 'Z', 'O', 'K'],\n    ['C', 'K', 'C', 'T', 'Z', 'G', 'E', 'G', 'M', 'L', 'D'],\n    ['P', 'G', 'H', 'Y', 'U', 'C', 'U', 'Y', 'S', 'E', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'U', 'Z', 'H', 'R', 'C', 'E', 'Q', 'R', 'J', 'V'],\n    ['R', 'Q', 'Y', 'T', 'K', 'X', 'I', 'V', 'U', 'I', 'S'],\n    ['D', 'A', 'R', 'H', 'Q', 'N', 'H', 'A', 'B', 'I', 'Y'],\n    ['T', 'K', 'X', 'F', 'D', 'D', 'G', 'A', 'T', 'M', 'I']\n]\n\nresult = find_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (4, 6). This result is derived from the matrix provided, where a square of 'J's is found starting at (2, 4) and ending at (4, 6).\n\nLet's verify the reasoning behind this result:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix has a 3x3 square of 'J's starting at (2, 4) and ending at (4, 6). This is the only square of 'J's with a side length of at least 3 in the matrix.\n\n2. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, and the code correctly identifies the only 3x3 square in the matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix and the constraints, the code has correctly identified the position of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 6]>>>"
