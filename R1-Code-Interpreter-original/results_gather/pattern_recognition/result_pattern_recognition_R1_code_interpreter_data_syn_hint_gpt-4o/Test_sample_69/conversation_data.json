    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Validation**: For each potential square, validate that all characters on the boundary of the square are the same.\n\n4. **Tracking the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if the square of size (size+1)x(size+1) is valid\n                valid_square = True\n                for k in range(size + 1):\n                    if matrix[i + size][j + k] != current_char or matrix[i + k][j + size] != current_char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    size += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            # Update the largest square found\n            if size > max_size:\n                max_size = size\n                bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'F', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['E', 'T', 'Y', 'G', 'F', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['U', 'G', 'P', 'S', 'F', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['W', 'E', 'A', 'V', 'P', 'A', 'I'],\n    ['J', 'W', 'E', 'F', 'A', 'Q', 'V'],\n    ['F', 'S', 'G', 'J', 'K', 'Y', 'Y'],\n    ['S', 'P', 'Q', 'N', 'B', 'U', 'K'],\n    ['W', 'A', 'G', 'Z', 'Z', 'H', 'Z']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (2, 6). Let's verify this result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is 8 rows by 7 columns. We need to find squares of at least 3x3 size.\n\n2. **Character Consistency**: The square must be composed of the same character on all sides.\n\n3. **Largest Square**: The code found a square with the bottom-right corner at (2, 6). Let's verify this by checking the matrix:\n\n   - The character 'F' appears in a 3x3 square starting at (0, 4) and ending at (2, 6):\n     ```\n     F F F\n     F F F\n     F F F\n     ```\n\n4. **Verification**: The square is valid as all sides are composed of the character 'F', and it is the largest possible square in the matrix.\n\nGiven this analysis, the result from the code is correct. The bottom-right corner of the largest square is indeed at position (2, 6).\n\n<<<[2, 6]>>>"
