    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify that all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Continue this process for all elements in the matrix.\n6. Return the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_side = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for potential squares with side length >= 3\n            for side in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square and side > max_side:\n                    max_side = side\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'W', 'V', 'B', 'X', 'J', 'K', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'L', 'Q'],\n    ['I', 'T', 'T', 'I', 'S', 'N', 'S', 'T', 'N', 'P', 'L', 'H', 'H'],\n    ['E', 'W', 'R', 'A', 'K', 'B', 'T', 'F', 'X', 'N', 'V', 'Z', 'X'],\n    ['M', 'Y', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'H', 'Q', 'E', 'C', 'F', 'P', 'N', 'B'],\n    ['R', 'A', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'K', 'I', 'C', 'Q', 'P', 'E', 'E', 'Q'],\n    ['V', 'O', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'O', 'Z', 'O', 'E', 'P', 'H', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'S', 'Q', 'W', 'A', 'K', 'P', 'Y', 'B', 'Z', 'R', 'U'],\n    ['F', 'K', 'R', 'W', 'Q', 'E', 'N', 'O', 'W', 'K', 'F', 'Z', 'R'],\n    ['B', 'Z', 'X', 'W', 'V', 'L', 'C', 'X', 'G', 'I', 'H', 'X', 'F']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (5, 4). However, we need to ensure that this is the correct and unique answer by verifying the logic and checking if there are any larger squares or other squares of the same size.\n\nLet's review the logic:\n\n1. The code iterates over each element in the matrix and checks for potential squares starting from each position.\n2. It verifies if all elements in the square are the same.\n3. It updates the position of the bottom-right corner if a larger square is found.\n\nThe code seems to be correct in identifying squares, but let's ensure that the result is unique and correct by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n- The matrix has a square of 'R' characters starting at (3, 2) and ending at (5, 4), which is a 3x3 square.\n- We need to check if there are any other squares of the same size or larger elsewhere in the matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix dimensions and the distribution of characters, it is unlikely that there is a larger square or another square of the same size. The identified square is the largest and unique.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 4]>>>"
