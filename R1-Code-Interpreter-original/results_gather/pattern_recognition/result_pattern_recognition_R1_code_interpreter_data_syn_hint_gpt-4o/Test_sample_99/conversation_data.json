    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character in the given matrix with a side length of at least 3. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For a potential square, verify that all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Function to check if a square of size `size` can be formed starting at (r, c)\n    def is_square(r, c, size):\n        char = matrix[r][c]\n        for i in range(size):\n            for j in range(size):\n                if matrix[r + i][c + j] != char:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - r, cols - c) + 1):\n                if is_square(r, c, size):\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the first found square\n                    return [r + size - 1, c + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['R', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'Q', 'A', 'K', 'G', 'G', 'V'],\n    ['H', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'R', 'U', 'Z', 'X', 'P', 'H'],\n    ['N', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'N', 'J', 'F', 'V', 'P', 'J'],\n    ['E', 'V', 'P', 'B', 'O', 'P', 'H', 'H', 'T', 'A'],\n    ['G', 'R', 'Q', 'Y', 'K', 'V', 'Y', 'Y', 'H', 'Q'],\n    ['Y', 'G', 'R', 'N', 'K', 'Y', 'R', 'H', 'Y', 'E'],\n    ['J', 'E', 'M', 'A', 'S', 'L', 'F', 'I', 'Q', 'N']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [2, 3]. However, let's verify this result through reasoning to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: \n   - The matrix is a 7x10 grid.\n   - We need to find a square of at least 3x3 with all elements being the same character.\n\n2. **Square Identification**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and check for squares of increasing size.\n   - For each potential top-left corner, check if a 3x3 square can be formed.\n   - If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The code found a square with the bottom-right corner at [2, 3].\n   - Let's verify this by checking the elements from [0, 0] to [2, 3].\n\n4. **Manual Check**:\n   - The elements from [0, 0] to [2, 3] form a 3x3 square with the character 'L':\n     ```\n     L L L\n     L L L\n     L L L\n     ```\n   - The bottom-right corner of this square is indeed at [2, 3].\n\nThe code correctly identified the square, and the manual check confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 3]>>>"
