    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify if all characters in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Continue this process until the entire matrix is checked.\n6. Return the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from (i, j)\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['J', 'U', 'O', 'R', 'Z', 'U', 'T', 'O'],\n    ['M', 'U', 'Y', 'I', 'W', 'U', 'Y', 'C'],\n    ['V', 'D', 'O', 'L', 'R', 'Q', 'S', 'E'],\n    ['K', 'N', 'Z', 'L', 'O', 'S', 'T', 'E'],\n    ['B', 'C', 'F', 'Z', 'D', 'L', 'C', 'W'],\n    ['K', 'K', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'A', 'Z', 'T'],\n    ['O', 'T', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'L', 'R', 'W'],\n    ['F', 'Q', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'I', 'V', 'E'],\n    ['Q', 'A', 'V', 'X', 'O', 'F', 'N', 'C'],\n    ['S', 'L', 'K', 'B', 'U', 'Z', 'H', 'R'],\n    ['A', 'W', 'L', 'R', 'M', 'S', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['A', 'L', 'E', 'Q', 'L', 'V', 'P', 'O'],\n    ['G', 'T', 'L', 'K', 'C', 'H', 'I', 'H'],\n    ['U', 'T', 'Y', 'K', 'N', 'K', 'B', 'J']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (7, 4). However, we need to ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique answer by verifying the logic and checking if there are any larger squares or other squares of the same size.\n\nLet's review the logic:\n\n1. The code iterates over each element in the matrix and checks for squares starting from each position.\n2. It checks for squares of increasing size, starting from a minimum size of 3.\n3. It verifies if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n4. It updates the maximum size and the position of the bottom-right corner if a larger square is found.\n\nGiven the matrix and the result, let's ensure that the logic correctly identifies the largest square and that there are no other squares of the same size or larger.\n\nTo confirm, let's re-evaluate the matrix manually or through a more detailed analysis to ensure the correctness of the result. If necessary, we can refine the code or logic.\n\nUpon reviewing the matrix, the identified square with the bottom-right corner at (7, 4) is indeed a valid square of 'P' characters with a side length of 3. There are no larger squares or other squares of the same size in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 4]>>>"
