    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n```\nI E L F L B\nQ V L Q F X\nT P K J U R\nD Q D W A Y\nW S S S S S\nA S S S Y E\nB S S S G J\nV R T I X M\n```\n\nWe will iterate through the matrix and check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3. For each potential square, we will verify if all characters in the square are the same. If a valid square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef find_squares(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    min_size = 3\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(min_size, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    result.append((i + size - 1, j + size - 1))\n    \n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'E', 'L', 'F', 'L', 'B'],\n    ['Q', 'V', 'L', 'Q', 'F', 'X'],\n    ['T', 'P', 'K', 'J', 'U', 'R'],\n    ['D', 'Q', 'D', 'W', 'A', 'Y'],\n    ['W', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S'],\n    ['A', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'Y', 'E'],\n    ['B', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'G', 'J'],\n    ['V', 'R', 'T', 'I', 'X', 'M']\n]\n\nsquares = find_squares(matrix)\nprint(squares)\n```\n\nThis code will output the positions of the bottom-right corners of all squares with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution result indicates that there is a square with a bottom-right corner at position (6, 3). However, we need to ensure that this is the only square with a side length of at least 3 and that it is indeed valid.\n\nLet's verify the result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n1. The matrix has a region of 'S' characters starting from row 4, column 1 to row 6, column 3. This forms a 3x3 square:\n   ```\n   S S S\n   S S S\n   S S S\n   ```\n\n2. The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (6, 3).\n\n3. We need to ensure that there are no other squares of the same or larger size elsewhere in the matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix structure, the only region with a consistent character forming a square of size 3x3 or larger is the 'S' region identified above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the position of the bottom-right corner of this square:\n\n<<<[6, 3]>>>"
