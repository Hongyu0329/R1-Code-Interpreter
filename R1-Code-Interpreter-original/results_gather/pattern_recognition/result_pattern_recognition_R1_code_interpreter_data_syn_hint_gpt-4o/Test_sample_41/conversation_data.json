    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify that all characters in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X', 'V', 'M', 'P', 'Z', 'I', 'V', 'L'],\n    ['P', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'H', 'E', 'M', 'X', 'Q', 'P', 'W'],\n    ['R', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'C', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'O', 'T', 'D', 'S'],\n    ['N', 'I', 'B', 'O', 'X', 'T', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'V', 'A', 'T'],\n    ['U', 'T', 'X', 'P', 'E', 'Y', 'U', 'Y', 'P', 'F', 'N', 'F'],\n    ['H', 'B', 'Z', 'I', 'M', 'N', 'X', 'Y', 'A', 'G', 'J', 'W']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [2, 3]. However, we need to ensure that this result is correct and that the square is indeed composed of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\nLet's verify the result through reasoning:\n\n1. The matrix is given as:\n   ```\n   T E E E X V M P Z I V L\n   P E E E F H E M X Q P W\n   R E E E C O Q S O T D S\n   N I B O X T D F I V A T\n   U T X P E Y U Y P F N F\n   H B Z I M N X Y A G J W\n   ```\n\n2. The code identified a square with the bottom-right corner at [2, 3]. This corresponds to the character 'E' in the matrix.\n\n3. Let's manually check the 3x3 square starting from the top-left corner [0, 1] to [2, 3]:\n   ```\n   E E E\n   E E E\n   E E E\n   ```\n\n4. All characters in this 3x3 square are 'E', confirming that it is a valid square.\n\nSince the code correctly identified the square, the result is valid. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 3]>>>"
