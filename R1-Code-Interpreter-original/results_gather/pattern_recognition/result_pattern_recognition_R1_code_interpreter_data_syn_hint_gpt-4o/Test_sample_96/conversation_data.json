    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, which are 7 rows and 11 columns in this case.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all the characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'G', 'U', 'O', 'U', 'K', 'G', 'C', 'Z', 'N', 'Z'],\n    ['F', 'H', 'V', 'R', 'D', 'X', 'T', 'N', 'P', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'Y', 'T', 'T', 'D', 'B', 'F', 'Z', 'F'],\n    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'S', 'Q', 'U', 'K', 'M', 'R', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'E', 'H', 'V', 'U', 'U', 'H', 'N', 'B'],\n    ['F', 'O', 'S', 'R', 'Y', 'S', 'U', 'C', 'K', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['I', 'X', 'J', 'G', 'S', 'Y', 'B', 'K', 'M', 'E', 'B']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (4, 2). However, we need to ensure that this result is correct and that the code efficiently finds the largest square with a side length of at least 3.\n\nLet's review the logic and ensure that the code correctly identifies squares of the same character and checks all possible positions in the matrix. The approach involves iterating over each possible starting point and checking for squares of increasing size, ensuring that all characters in the square are the same.\n\nThe code seems to be correct in its logic, but let's verify the result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: \n   - The matrix has a clear 3x3 square of 'B' characters starting at (2, 0) and ending at (4, 2).\n   - This is the largest square of identical characters in the matrix.\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - The square starts at (2, 0) and ends at (4, 2).\n   - All characters in this 3x3 square are 'B'.\n\nGiven this analysis, the result of (4, 2) is indeed correct. The code has correctly identified the largest square of identical characters.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 2]>>>"
