    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: Ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the identified square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need at least a 3x3 matrix to form a square of side 3\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the current square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # If a square is found, return the bottom-right corner\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['B', 'E', 'S', 'O', 'W', 'T', 'U', 'P', 'Q', 'J', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['W', 'J', 'D', 'R', 'F', 'N', 'H', 'H', 'J', 'N', 'P', 'B'],\n    ['S', 'D', 'O', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'O', 'R', 'A', 'T', 'X'],\n    ['H', 'S', 'R', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Y', 'E', 'Y', 'K', 'G'],\n    ['C', 'L', 'L', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'O', 'Y', 'Y', 'P', 'H'],\n    ['H', 'W', 'D', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'I', 'K', 'O', 'D', 'D'],\n    ['P', 'P', 'V', 'R', 'R', 'H', 'Q', 'Q', 'F', 'A', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['J', 'B', 'M', 'F', 'C', 'P', 'X', 'A', 'L', 'N', 'B', 'P'],\n    ['Z', 'Y', 'O', 'A', 'Q', 'T', 'D', 'J', 'D', 'K', 'M', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through the matrix, checking for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3, and will return the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the first valid square it finds.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [4, 5]. However, let's ensure that this result is correct by reviewing the logic and confirming that the square is indeed composed of the same character.\n\n### Review and Verification:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 12 columns.\n2. **Square Identification**: The code checks for squares starting from the top-left corner and increases the size until it finds a valid square.\n3. **Character Uniformity**: The code verifies that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n### Verification of the Result:\n\n- The result [4, 5] suggests that the square is located with its bottom-right corner at row 4, column 5.\n- The character at the top-left corner of this square is 'N'.\n- We need to verify that all characters in the 3x3 square starting at [2, 3] and ending at [4, 5] are 'N'.\n\nLet's manually verify this:\n\n- Row 2: ['N', 'N', 'N']\n- Row 3: ['N', 'N', 'N']\n- Row 4: ['N', 'N', 'N']\n\nAll characters in this 3x3 square are indeed 'N', confirming that the result is correct.\n\nSince the code has correctly identified the square, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<[4, 5]>>>"
