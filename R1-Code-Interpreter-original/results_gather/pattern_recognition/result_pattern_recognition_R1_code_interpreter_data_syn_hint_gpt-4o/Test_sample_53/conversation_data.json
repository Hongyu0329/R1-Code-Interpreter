    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify that all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['O', 'P', 'R', 'F', 'A', 'L', 'M', 'G'],\n    ['C', 'Y', 'D', 'Z', 'F', 'V', 'G', 'V'],\n    ['Q', 'I', 'J', 'B', 'I', 'V', 'B', 'E'],\n    ['F', 'A', 'F', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'L'],\n    ['D', 'B', 'Z', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'P'],\n    ['Y', 'I', 'O', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['K', 'K', 'J', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'Q'],\n    ['C', 'V', 'O', 'F', 'E', 'Z', 'J', 'C'],\n    ['J', 'F', 'D', 'V', 'C', 'F', 'S', 'A']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [5, 5]. This means that there is a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3, ending at this position in the matrix.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of this result, let's verify the logic:\n\n1. The code iterates over each element in the matrix and checks for potential squares starting from each position.\n2. It checks for squares of size 3x3 or larger, ensuring that all elements in the square are the same.\n3. Once a valid square is found, it returns the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic, the result [5, 5] indicates that there is a 3x3 square of the character 'V' starting from position [3, 3] to [5, 5]. This is consistent with the matrix data provided.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 5]>>>"
