    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix, which is 10x6 in this case.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of the same character can be formed.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed by ensuring all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'I', 'V', 'Q', 'I', 'G'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'L', 'F', 'V', 'W'],\n    ['C', 'Y', 'V', 'V', 'J', 'T'],\n    ['R', 'M', 'J', 'J', 'Q', 'R'],\n    ['C', 'O', 'T', 'K', 'T', 'X'],\n    ['Z', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'T'],\n    ['L', 'F', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'X'],\n    ['H', 'R', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'Q'],\n    ['T', 'H', 'W', 'A', 'T', 'Q'],\n    ['G', 'I', 'U', 'M', 'U', 'V']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the largest square.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (7, 4). Let's verify this result through reasoning:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is 10 rows by 6 columns. We need to find squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\n2. **Square Verification**: The code checks for squares starting from each position in the matrix and verifies if a square of increasing size can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Result Verification**: The result (7, 4) suggests that there is a square with the bottom-right corner at this position. Let's manually verify this:\n\n   - Starting from position (5, 2), we have:\n     ```\n     B B B\n     B B B\n     B B B\n     ```\n   - This forms a 3x3 square with the character 'B', and the bottom-right corner is indeed at (7, 4).\n\nThe code correctly identifies the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 4]>>>"
