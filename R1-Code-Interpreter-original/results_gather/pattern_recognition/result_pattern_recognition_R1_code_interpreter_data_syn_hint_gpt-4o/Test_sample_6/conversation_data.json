    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size can be formed with the same character.\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, record the bottom-right corner coordinates.\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'W', 'F', 'E', 'O', 'J'],\n    ['V', 'J', 'W', 'O', 'V', 'E'],\n    ['F', 'Y', 'F', 'W', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['Z', 'Y', 'Z', 'U', 'Q', 'K'],\n    ['Y', 'Y', 'K', 'W', 'F', 'G'],\n    ['J', 'O', 'S', 'A', 'H', 'L'],\n    ['B', 'G', 'E', 'I', 'K', 'S'],\n    ['C', 'S', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'U'],\n    ['Y', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'N'],\n    ['U', 'Y', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'G']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the largest square.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (9, 4). However, let's verify this result through reasoning to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is a 10x6 grid. We need to find squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to check each possible top-left corner and see if a square can be formed. The square must have all sides of equal length and be composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so there should be only one largest square that meets the criteria.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's manually verify the result by examining the matrix:\n\n- The matrix has a region of 'A's starting from row 7, column 2:\n  ```\n  A A A\n  A A A\n  A A A\n  ```\n  This forms a 3x3 square with the bottom-right corner at (9, 4).\n\n- No other region in the matrix forms a square of the same character with a side length of 3 or more.\n\nGiven this manual verification, the result from the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is indeed at position (9, 4).\n\n<<<[9, 4]>>>"
