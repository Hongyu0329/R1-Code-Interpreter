    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each position, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, calculate the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for possible square sizes starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['J', 'K', 'S', 'P', 'X', 'L'],\n    ['Q', 'V', 'G', 'W', 'W', 'W'],\n    ['T', 'U', 'S', 'W', 'W', 'W'],\n    ['N', 'X', 'N', 'W', 'W', 'W'],\n    ['E', 'I', 'L', 'H', 'A', 'B'],\n    ['R', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'D', 'V'],\n    ['J', 'S', 'B', 'F', 'U', 'X'],\n    ['Y', 'K', 'O', 'V', 'U', 'E'],\n    ['Z', 'F', 'X', 'R', 'I', 'N']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (3, 5). This means that the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is located in the matrix with its bottom-right corner at row 3, column 5.\n\nGiven the matrix and the constraints, this result seems consistent with the problem requirements. The square is composed of the character 'W' and is located in the bottom-right corner of the 3x3 submatrix starting at row 1, column 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 5]>>>"
