    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix, which are 8 rows and 7 columns in this case.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit. This means iterating from row 0 to row 5 and column 0 to column 4, as a 3x3 square needs at least 3 rows and 3 columns.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over possible top-left corners of squares\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['O', 'G', 'U', 'F', 'B', 'F', 'C'],\n    ['M', 'O', 'M', 'K', 'M', 'F', 'D'],\n    ['X', 'V', 'N', 'C', 'I', 'P', 'M'],\n    ['U', 'Z', 'U', 'G', 'P', 'U', 'A'],\n    ['E', 'C', 'Q', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['G', 'P', 'A', 'E', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['U', 'D', 'Y', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'G', 'W', 'F', 'A', 'Z']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position [6, 6]. This suggests that there is a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3, ending at this position. \n\nLet's verify this result by examining the matrix:\n\n```\nO G U F B F C\nM O M K M F D\nX V N C I P M\nU Z U G P U A\nE C Q P C C C\nG P A E C C C\nU D Y D C C C\nR S G W F A Z\n```\n\nFrom the matrix, we can see that there is a 3x3 square of 'C' characters starting at position (4, 4) and ending at position (6, 6):\n\n```\nC C C\nC C C\nC C C\n```\n\nThis confirms that the bottom-right corner of the square is indeed at position [6, 6].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 6]>>>"
