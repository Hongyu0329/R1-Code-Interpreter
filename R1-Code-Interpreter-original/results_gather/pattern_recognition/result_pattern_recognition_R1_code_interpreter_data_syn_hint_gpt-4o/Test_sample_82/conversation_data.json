    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's a 6x10 matrix.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. For each potential top-left corner of a square, we will check if a square of increasing size can be formed.\n\n3. **Character Consistency**: For a square to be valid, all characters on its boundary must be the same.\n\n4. **Iterate and Check**: Start from each cell and attempt to form squares of increasing size. If a valid square is found, record its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if a square of this size can be formed\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                # Check the right and bottom boundaries\n                for k in range(size):\n                    if matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] != char or matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] != char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    if size > max_size:\n                        max_size = size\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['P', 'S', 'K', 'Y', 'A', 'O', 'X', 'B', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['T', 'Y', 'Z', 'V', 'T', 'M', 'K', 'X', 'A', 'T'],\n    ['D', 'P', 'R', 'O', 'Z', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'Y', 'J'],\n    ['R', 'X', 'K', 'W', 'M', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'N', 'G'],\n    ['B', 'V', 'B', 'T', 'D', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'I'],\n    ['B', 'M', 'I', 'D', 'X', 'M', 'P', 'E', 'A', 'K']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (4, 7). Let's verify this result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is a 6x10 grid. We need to find squares of at least 3x3 where all boundary characters are the same.\n\n2. **Square Verification**: The code checks for squares starting from each cell and attempts to form squares of increasing size. It verifies if the boundary characters are consistent.\n\n3. **Result Verification**: The result (4, 7) suggests that a square with the bottom-right corner at this position was found. Let's manually verify this:\n\n   - Starting from (2, 5), we have:\n     ```\n     K K K\n     K K K\n     K K K\n     ```\n   - This forms a 3x3 square with 'K' as the boundary character.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The code correctly identifies the largest square with consistent boundary characters.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic applied, the result seems accurate. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 7]>>>"
