    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the range of possible square sizes.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = min(rows, cols)\n    largest_square = None\n\n    for size in range(3, max_size + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    largest_square = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return largest_square\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'N', 'W', 'Y', 'F', 'A', 'R'],\n    ['O', 'C', 'Z', 'U', 'J', 'D', 'Y'],\n    ['Z', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'P'],\n    ['N', 'J', 'S', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['M', 'H', 'H', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'S'],\n    ['P', 'W', 'A', 'A', 'P', 'M', 'U'],\n    ['R', 'P', 'S', 'F', 'M', 'P', 'B'],\n    ['H', 'T', 'B', 'C', 'X', 'J', 'B'],\n    ['O', 'Z', 'X', 'A', 'P', 'E', 'V']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (4, 5). This means that the square is located in the matrix with its bottom-right corner at row 4 and column 5.\n\nGiven the matrix and the problem statement, this result seems consistent with the requirement to find a square of at least 3x3 size composed of the same character. The square found is composed of the character 'C', and it spans from row 2 to row 4 and column 2 to column 5.\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, and the code has successfully identified the largest square, we can conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 5]>>>"
