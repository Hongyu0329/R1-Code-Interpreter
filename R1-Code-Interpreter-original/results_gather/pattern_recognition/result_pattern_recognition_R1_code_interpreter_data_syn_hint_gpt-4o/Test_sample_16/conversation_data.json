    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, we need to determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, the matrix is 7 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of the same character can be formed.\n\n3. **Character Consistency**: For each potential square, we need to ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, we record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, we output the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for possible square sizes starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'O', 'T', 'I', 'A', 'S'],\n    ['D', 'Y', 'R', 'B', 'U', 'O'],\n    ['Y', 'M', 'S', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['N', 'G', 'H', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['Q', 'S', 'X', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['V', 'P', 'M', 'K', 'Z', 'J'],\n    ['E', 'X', 'X', 'M', 'F', 'N']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3 and return the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (4, 5). This means that the square is located in the matrix with its bottom-right corner at row 4 and column 5.\n\nLet's verify this result by examining the matrix:\n\n```\nE O T I A S\nD Y R B U O\nY M S Z Z Z\nN G H Z Z Z\nQ S X Z Z Z\nV P M K Z J\nE X X M F N\n```\n\nThe square is composed of the character 'Z' and is located in the following positions:\n\n- Top-left corner at (2, 3)\n- Bottom-right corner at (4, 5)\n\nThe square is:\n\n```\nZ Z Z\nZ Z Z\nZ Z Z\n```\n\nThis confirms that the bottom-right corner of the largest square is indeed at (4, 5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 5]>>>"
