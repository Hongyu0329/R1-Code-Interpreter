    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, we need to determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each potential square, we will check if it can form a valid square with the same character on all sides.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For a given top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed. We will ensure that all characters on the boundary of the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest valid square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with (i, j) as the top-left corner\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if a square of this size can be formed\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                # Check the right and bottom boundaries\n                for k in range(size):\n                    if matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] != char or matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] != char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    # Update the largest square found\n                    if size > max_size:\n                        max_size = size\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'N', 'V', 'J', 'R', 'J', 'G', 'U'],\n    ['A', 'X', 'R', 'D', 'B', 'W', 'L', 'Z'],\n    ['K', 'F', 'T', 'V', 'B', 'C', 'S', 'J'],\n    ['Q', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'F', 'X', 'H', 'S'],\n    ['S', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'A', 'M', 'A'],\n    ['H', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'S', 'M', 'Y', 'F'],\n    ['Q', 'G', 'H', 'Y', 'V', 'U', 'Y', 'H'],\n    ['A', 'C', 'O', 'U', 'L', 'Z', 'J', 'C'],\n    ['M', 'O', 'O', 'Q', 'N', 'N', 'O', 'H'],\n    ['X', 'Y', 'C', 'H', 'H', 'U', 'E', 'R']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (5, 3). However, let's verify this result through reasoning to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Verification Process\n\n1. **Matrix Overview**: The matrix is a 10x8 grid. We need to find squares of at least 3x3 where all sides are composed of the same character.\n\n2. **Identifying Squares**: We need to check for squares starting from each position in the matrix. The square must have the same character on all sides.\n\n3. **Result Verification**: The code found a square with the bottom-right corner at (5, 3). Let's verify this by checking the matrix manually:\n\n   - The square starts at (3, 1) and ends at (5, 3).\n   - The character 'I' forms a 3x3 square:\n     ```\n     I I I\n     I I I\n     I I I\n     ```\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The identified square is valid, and the bottom-right corner is indeed at (5, 3).\n\nGiven the verification, the result from the code is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 3]>>>"
