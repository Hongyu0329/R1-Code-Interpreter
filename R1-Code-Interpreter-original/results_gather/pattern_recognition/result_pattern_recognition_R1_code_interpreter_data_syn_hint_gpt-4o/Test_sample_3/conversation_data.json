    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix, which are the number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from each cell in the matrix and attempt to form a square with increasing side lengths.\n   - For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Check for Valid Squares**:\n   - For a square starting at position `(i, j)` with side length `k`, ensure that all characters in the sub-matrix from `(i, j)` to `(i+k-1, j+k-1)` are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner `(i+k-1, j+k-1)`.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_side = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares with increasing side lengths\n            for side in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square and side > max_side:\n                    max_side = side\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['B', 'K', 'I', 'O', 'F', 'H', 'B', 'J', 'L'],\n    ['F', 'J', 'L', 'G', 'P', 'D', 'S', 'Z', 'U'],\n    ['I', 'L', 'Z', 'Z', 'G', 'W', 'Y', 'V', 'F'],\n    ['J', 'T', 'D', 'L', 'Q', 'X', 'R', 'F', 'Z'],\n    ['E', 'X', 'O', 'I', 'P', 'X', 'V', 'G', 'O'],\n    ['K', 'F', 'R', 'Q', 'F', 'H', 'W', 'L', 'O'],\n    ['S', 'H', 'W', 'C', 'F', 'Z', 'E', 'L', 'Z'],\n    ['N', 'U', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'L'],\n    ['S', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'N', 'T'],\n    ['J', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'T', 'F'],\n    ['K', 'X', 'O', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'O', 'B'],\n    ['M', 'I', 'R', 'R', 'L', 'L', 'Q', 'Y', 'Q'],\n    ['H', 'D', 'J', 'A', 'D', 'S', 'O', 'V', 'H']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (10, 6). However, let's ensure that the solution is correct by reviewing the logic and confirming that the code correctly identifies the largest square.\n\n### Review and Verification:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 13 rows by 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Formation**: The code iterates over each cell and attempts to form squares with increasing side lengths, starting from 3.\n\n3. **Character Consistency Check**: For each potential square, the code checks if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Tracking the Largest Square**: The code keeps track of the largest square found and updates the bottom-right corner accordingly.\n\n5. **Output**: The code outputs the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic, the code seems to correctly identify the largest square. The result (10, 6) indicates that the largest square is formed by the character 'B' starting from row 8, column 2, and extending to row 10, column 6.\n\nSince the code execution result is consistent with the problem requirements, I am confident in the solution provided.\n\n<<<[10, 6]>>>"
