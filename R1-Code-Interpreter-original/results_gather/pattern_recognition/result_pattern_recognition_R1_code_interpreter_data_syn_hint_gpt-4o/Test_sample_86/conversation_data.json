    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed.\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, ensure all characters are the same.\n4. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'S', 'J', 'W', 'E', 'M', 'Y', 'Y', 'C'],\n    ['C', 'U', 'A', 'B', 'N', 'Z', 'Y', 'L', 'N'],\n    ['E', 'L', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'Y', 'E', 'W'],\n    ['Y', 'B', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['H', 'P', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'R', 'N', 'H'],\n    ['N', 'K', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'L', 'D', 'R'],\n    ['Z', 'X', 'C', 'Y', 'I', 'W', 'D', 'V', 'W'],\n    ['O', 'L', 'H', 'K', 'U', 'Y', 'K', 'U', 'P'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'W', 'A', 'M', 'R', 'S', 'F', 'D'],\n    ['C', 'C', 'R', 'C', 'A', 'P', 'L', 'A', 'X'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'C', 'L', 'Q', 'T', 'O', 'J', 'X'],\n    ['E', 'K', 'F', 'P', 'G', 'O', 'D', 'R', 'G'],\n    ['G', 'A', 'I', 'B', 'I', 'A', 'M', 'A', 'C']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nprint(find_largest_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3 and output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (5, 5). However, we need to ensure that this result is correct and that the code efficiently finds the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n\n### Verification and Optimization\n\n1. **Verification**: We need to verify that the square found is indeed the largest and that it meets the criteria of having a side length of at least 3.\n2. **Optimization**: The current approach checks every possible square, which might not be the most efficient. We can optimize by using dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid redundant checks.\n\n### Dynamic Programming Approach\n\nWe can use a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at `(i, j)`. The value of `dp[i][j]` can be computed as:\n\n- If `matrix[i][j]` is part of a square, then `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1`.\n- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = 0`.\n\nThis approach will allow us to efficiently compute the size of the largest square ending at each position and find the largest one.\n\nLet's implement this optimized approach in Python.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if i == 0 or j == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = 1  # The first row and column can only form squares of size 1\n            else:\n                if matrix[i][j] == matrix[i-1][j] == matrix[i][j-1] == matrix[i-1][j-1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = 1\n\n            if dp[i][j] >= 3 and dp[i][j] > max_size:\n                max_size = dp[i][j]\n                bottom_right_corner = (i, j)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'S', 'J', 'W', 'E', 'M', 'Y', 'Y', 'C'],\n    ['C', 'U', 'A', 'B', 'N', 'Z', 'Y', 'L', 'N'],\n    ['E', 'L', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'Y', 'E', 'W'],\n    ['Y', 'B', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['H', 'P', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'R', 'N', 'H'],\n    ['N', 'K', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'L', 'D', 'R'],\n    ['Z', 'X', 'C', 'Y', 'I', 'W', 'D', 'V', 'W'],\n    ['O', 'L', 'H', 'K', 'U', 'Y', 'K', 'U', 'P'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'W', 'A', 'M', 'R', 'S', 'F', 'D'],\n    ['C', 'C', 'R', 'C', 'A', 'P', 'L', 'A', 'X'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'C', 'L', 'Q', 'T', 'O', 'J', 'X'],\n    ['E', 'K', 'F', 'P', 'G', 'O', 'D', 'R', 'G'],\n    ['G', 'A', 'I', 'B', 'I', 'A', 'M', 'A', 'C']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nprint(find_largest_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code should efficiently find the largest square and provide the correct bottom-right corner coordinates. Let's see the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (5, 5). However, the task requires us to ensure that the square has a side length of at least 3, and the result should be unique. \n\n### Re-evaluation and Verification\n\n1. **Re-evaluation**: We need to ensure that the square found is indeed the largest and that it meets the criteria of having a side length of at least 3.\n2. **Verification**: We should verify that the square is unique and correctly identified.\n\n### Textual Reasoning\n\nLet's manually verify the matrix to ensure the correctness of the result:\n\n- The matrix has a block of 'F' characters starting from (2, 2) to (5, 5).\n- This block forms a square of size 4x4, which is larger than the minimum required size of 3x3.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is indeed at (5, 5).\n\nGiven the matrix and the identified square, the result seems correct. The square is unique because no other block of the same character forms a square of size 3x3 or larger.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 5]>>>"
