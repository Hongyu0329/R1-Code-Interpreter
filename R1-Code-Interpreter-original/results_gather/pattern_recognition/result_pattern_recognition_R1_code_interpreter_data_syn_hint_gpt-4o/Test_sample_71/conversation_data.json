    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, which are 8 rows and 12 columns in this case.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit. This means iterating from the top-left corner to a point where a 3x3 square can still fit within the matrix boundaries.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for possible square sizes starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'L', 'M', 'H', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'S', 'T', 'Y', 'L', 'P'],\n    ['A', 'C', 'L', 'O', 'U', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'X', 'I', 'O', 'T'],\n    ['H', 'F', 'W', 'S', 'C', 'B', 'C', 'W', 'D', 'V', 'U', 'G'],\n    ['K', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'Q', 'S', 'Y', 'Z', 'U', 'Q', 'E'],\n    ['C', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'O', 'O', 'E', 'S', 'A', 'P', 'I'],\n    ['N', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'W', 'V', 'Z', 'M', 'D', 'Q'],\n    ['Q', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'S', 'W', 'R', 'Y', 'T', 'O', 'N'],\n    ['N', 'Z', 'C', 'Z', 'Z', 'V', 'N', 'C', 'R', 'L', 'F', 'P']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (6, 4). Let's verify this result through reasoning and ensure that the logic is correct.\n\n### Verification and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is 8 rows by 12 columns. We need to find squares of at least 3x3 size where all characters are the same.\n\n2. **Largest Square Identification**: The code iterates over each possible starting point and checks for squares of increasing size. It records the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\n3. **Result Verification**: The result (6, 4) suggests that the largest square is located with its bottom-right corner at row 6, column 4. This implies a square of 'M' characters starting from row 3, column 1 to row 6, column 4.\n\n4. **Manual Check**: Let's manually verify this:\n   - The sub-matrix from (3, 1) to (6, 4) is:\n     ```\n     M M M M\n     M M M M\n     M M M M\n     M M M M\n     ```\n   - This is indeed a 4x4 square of 'M' characters.\n\nThe code correctly identifies the largest square, and the result is verified. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 4]>>>"
