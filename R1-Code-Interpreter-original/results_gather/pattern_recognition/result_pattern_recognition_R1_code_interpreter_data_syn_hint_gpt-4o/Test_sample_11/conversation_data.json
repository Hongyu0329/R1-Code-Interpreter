    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify if all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'D', 'L', 'G', 'V', 'L', 'V'],\n    ['A', 'K', 'L', 'K', 'E', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['L', 'Z', 'O', 'A', 'V', 'A', 'M'],\n    ['M', 'M', 'M', 'Z', 'K', 'W', 'S'],\n    ['M', 'M', 'M', 'J', 'C', 'M', 'Y'],\n    ['M', 'M', 'M', 'C', 'W', 'Q', 'D'],\n    ['M', 'Y', 'Q', 'P', 'I', 'X', 'Z'],\n    ['A', 'F', 'F', 'U', 'D', 'U', 'G'],\n    ['R', 'L', 'N', 'P', 'P', 'U', 'K'],\n    ['P', 'C', 'M', 'C', 'R', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['V', 'E', 'O', 'J', 'B', 'R', 'I'],\n    ['X', 'Y', 'C', 'R', 'N', 'R', 'R'],\n    ['U', 'C', 'F', 'Z', 'Q', 'T', 'A'],\n    ['Z', 'W', 'H', 'X', 'P', 'M', 'P']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [5, 2]. This result is derived from the matrix provided, where the character 'M' forms a 3x3 square starting at position [3, 0] and ending at [5, 2].\n\nLet's verify the logic and ensure that the solution is correct:\n\n1. The matrix is iterated over, and for each element, we check if it can be the top-left corner of a square.\n2. The size of the square is increased starting from 3, and we check if all elements in the square are the same.\n3. If a valid square is found, the position of its bottom-right corner is returned.\n\nThe code correctly identifies the square formed by the character 'M' from [3, 0] to [5, 2]. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, this is the only square with a side length of at least 3 in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 2]>>>"
