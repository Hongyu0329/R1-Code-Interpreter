    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's an 8x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to check for squares of the same character starting from each position in the matrix. The minimum side length for a square is 3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each position in the matrix, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Minimum side length of the square\n    min_side = 3\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting point for a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check possible square sizes starting from (i, j)\n            for side in range(min_side, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner\n                if is_square:\n                    bottom_right = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n                    return bottom_right\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['W', 'E', 'B', 'P', 'M', 'L'],\n    ['E', 'R', 'Q', 'T', 'S', 'L'],\n    ['Z', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'D', 'H'],\n    ['R', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'F', 'A'],\n    ['K', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'N', 'F'],\n    ['R', 'K', 'R', 'V', 'D', 'J'],\n    ['J', 'W', 'T', 'E', 'W', 'J'],\n    ['E', 'A', 'M', 'R', 'E', 'K']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the square\nresult = find_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the square.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position (4, 3). Let's verify this result through reasoning:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is 8 rows by 6 columns. We need to find a square of at least 3x3 with the same character.\n\n2. **Character 'V'**: Observing the matrix, the character 'V' appears prominently in a 3x3 square starting at position (2, 1) and ending at position (4, 3).\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - The square starts at (2, 1) and extends to (4, 3).\n   - All characters in this 3x3 region are 'V'.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The bottom-right corner of this square is indeed at (4, 3).\n\nThe code correctly identified the bottom-right corner of the square. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 3]>>>"
