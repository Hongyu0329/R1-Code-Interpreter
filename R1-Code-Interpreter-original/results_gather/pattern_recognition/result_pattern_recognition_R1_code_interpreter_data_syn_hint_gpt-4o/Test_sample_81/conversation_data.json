    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify that all characters in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'L', 'H', 'G', 'V', 'I', 'O', 'V', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'K', 'I'],\n    ['N', 'W', 'H', 'X', 'B', 'E', 'K', 'C', 'W', 'T', 'A', 'J', 'I', 'O', 'D'],\n    ['X', 'Q', 'B', 'V', 'S', 'X', 'X', 'I', 'D', 'I', 'Y', 'C', 'T', 'N', 'L'],\n    ['O', 'U', 'I', 'N', 'Y', 'W', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'P', 'Q', 'H'],\n    ['M', 'R', 'N', 'U', 'X', 'O', 'Y', 'U', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'J', 'J', 'Y', 'T'],\n    ['A', 'T', 'E', 'U', 'W', 'Y', 'K', 'Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'K', 'L', 'W', 'S']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [5, 10]. This result is consistent with the problem's requirement to find the unique square in the matrix. \n\nThe code iteratively checks each position in the matrix to see if it can be the top-left corner of a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. Once it finds such a square, it returns the position of the bottom-right corner.\n\nGiven that the problem states the answer is unique, and the code has successfully identified a square, we can conclude that the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 10]>>>"
