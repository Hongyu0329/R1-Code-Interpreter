    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: Ensure that all characters in the potential square are the same.\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need to find squares of at least size 3x3\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['D', 'C', 'D', 'R', 'Q', 'P'],\n    ['I', 'V', 'B', 'P', 'O', 'E'],\n    ['U', 'K', 'X', 'E', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'N', 'U', 'N'],\n    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'M', 'B', 'P'],\n    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'E', 'N'],\n    ['Q', 'A', 'O', 'I', 'F', 'B'],\n    ['V', 'R', 'Q', 'G', 'L', 'V'],\n    ['W', 'H', 'C', 'O', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['K', 'L', 'Y', 'M', 'V', 'Z'],\n    ['G', 'R', 'M', 'U', 'A', 'G']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the square.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [5, 2]. This result is consistent with the matrix provided, where the character 'R' forms a 3x3 square starting from position [3, 0] to [5, 2].\n\nLet's verify the result by reasoning through the matrix:\n\n### Matrix Analysis:\n- The matrix is 11 rows by 6 columns.\n- We are looking for a square of at least 3x3 with the same character.\n\n### Observations:\n- Starting from row 3, column 0, we have:\n  ```\n  R R R\n  R R R\n  R R R\n  ```\n  This forms a 3x3 square with the character 'R'.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position [5, 2].\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, and our code has identified this square correctly, we can conclude that the result is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 2]>>>"
