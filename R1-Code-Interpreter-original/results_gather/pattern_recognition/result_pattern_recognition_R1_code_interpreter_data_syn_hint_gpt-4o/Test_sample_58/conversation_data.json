    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for checking potential squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each cell in the matrix that could potentially be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3) can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'A', 'W', 'G', 'J', 'I', 'L', 'W', 'H'],\n    ['L', 'I', 'P', 'E', 'B', 'T', 'J', 'Z', 'C'],\n    ['R', 'P', 'H', 'P', 'D', 'H', 'G', 'D', 'N'],\n    ['J', 'J', 'J', 'D', 'N', 'T', 'P', 'N', 'G'],\n    ['J', 'J', 'J', 'O', 'R', 'O', 'A', 'A', 'H'],\n    ['J', 'J', 'J', 'M', 'C', 'V', 'P', 'T', 'J'],\n    ['S', 'R', 'U', 'E', 'L', 'E', 'Z', 'K', 'F']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (5, 2). However, we need to ensure that this result is correct and that the code efficiently finds the largest square.\n\nLet's review the logic and ensure that the code correctly identifies squares of the same character and checks all possible positions in the matrix. The code iterates over each possible top-left corner and checks for squares of increasing size, ensuring that all characters in the square are the same.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n\n```\nZ A W G J I L W H\nL I P E B T J Z C\nR P H P D H G D N\nJ J J D N T P N G\nJ J J O R O A A H\nJ J J M C V P T J\nS R U E L E Z K F\n```\n\nThe code correctly identifies the largest square of 'J's starting at (3, 0) and ending at (5, 2). This is a 3x3 square, which is the largest possible square of the same character in the matrix.\n\nSince the code has correctly identified the largest square, we can conclude that the result is accurate. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 2]>>>"
