    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's a 9x7 matrix.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to check for squares of the same character starting from each position in the matrix. The minimum side length for a square is 3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each position in the matrix, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Minimum side length of the square\n    min_side = 3\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of the square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check possible square sizes starting from 3x3\n            for side in range(min_side, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + side):\n                    for y in range(j, j + side):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, return the bottom-right corner\n                if is_square:\n                    bottom_right = (i + side - 1, j + side - 1)\n                    return bottom_right\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['J', 'R', 'Z', 'T', 'F', 'B', 'R'],\n    ['N', 'F', 'J', 'S', 'Q', 'U', 'D'],\n    ['F', 'B', 'H', 'U', 'X', 'L', 'W'],\n    ['Y', 'M', 'K', 'U', 'L', 'H', 'N'],\n    ['C', 'U', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'B', 'Q'],\n    ['I', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'T', 'Z', 'I'],\n    ['A', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'E', 'D', 'H'],\n    ['B', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'X', 'U', 'R'],\n    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'I']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the square\nresult = find_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at position (7, 3). However, let's verify this result through reasoning to ensure its correctness.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Matrix Analysis**: The matrix is a 9x7 grid. We need to find a square of at least 3x3 with all the same characters.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix for a square of the same character. The square must be at least 3x3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Matrix**: For each position, check if a square can be formed. If a square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the solution is unique, so we should find only one valid square.\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet's manually verify the result by examining the matrix:\n\n- Starting from position (5, 1), we have:\n  ```\n  N N N\n  N N N\n  N N N\n  ```\n  This forms a 3x3 square with the character 'N'. The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (7, 3).\n\nGiven this manual verification, the result from the code execution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 3]>>>"
