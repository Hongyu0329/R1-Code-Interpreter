    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us iterate over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size can be formed. We start with a size of 3 and increase it until we can no longer form a square.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential square, check if all characters on the boundary of the square are the same. This involves checking the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column of the square.\n\n4. **Record the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if a square of this size can be formed\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                # Check top and bottom rows\n                for k in range(size):\n                    if matrix[i][j + k] != char or matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] != char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                # Check left and right columns\n                for k in range(size):\n                    if matrix[i + k][j] != char or matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] != char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'M', 'Q', 'A', 'J', 'N', 'Z', 'I', 'B', 'F', 'H', 'W', 'M', 'W'],\n    ['A', 'V', 'O', 'A', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'M', 'X', 'B', 'C', 'N', 'M', 'V'],\n    ['X', 'Z', 'Z', 'D', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'S', 'V', 'J', 'N', 'R', 'D', 'L'],\n    ['S', 'Z', 'T', 'O', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'P', 'M', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'D', 'T'],\n    ['B', 'W', 'O', 'Q', 'E', 'I', 'B', 'A', 'K', 'A', 'Q', 'X', 'N', 'T'],\n    ['K', 'O', 'V', 'B', 'U', 'G', 'O', 'B', 'Q', 'S', 'F', 'R', 'U', 'J']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the row and column of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (3, 6). This means that the square is located in the matrix with its bottom-right corner at row 3 and column 6.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of this result, let's verify the square:\n\n1. **Character Consistency**: The square should be composed of the same character on all its sides.\n2. **Square Size**: The side length should be at least 3.\n\nLet's check the matrix manually for the square starting at (1, 4) and ending at (3, 6):\n\n- The character at (1, 4) is 'Z'.\n- The square formed by the coordinates (1, 4) to (3, 6) is:\n  ```\n  Z Z Z\n  Z Z Z\n  Z Z Z\n  ```\n- All characters are 'Z', and the side length is 3, which satisfies the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the result is correct. The bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (3, 6).\n\n<<<[3, 6]>>>"
