    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for our search.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square and check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3) can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'X', 'A', 'L', 'J', 'V', 'X', 'Y', 'Y', 'L', 'R', 'U', 'X', 'I'],\n    ['E', 'G', 'D', 'U', 'Y', 'T', 'C', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'L', 'I', 'U'],\n    ['K', 'X', 'S', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'D', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'U', 'S', 'R'],\n    ['F', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'F', 'O', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'C', 'E'],\n    ['C', 'K', 'W', 'Z', 'C', 'V', 'Y', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'K', 'D'],\n    ['H', 'E', 'N', 'J', 'Y', 'T', 'O', 'V', 'M', 'U', 'O', 'Y', 'J', 'J'],\n    ['R', 'A', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'K', 'K', 'I', 'K', 'I', 'O', 'P', 'D', 'P'],\n    ['E', 'M', 'G', 'B', 'E', 'E', 'G', 'X', 'G', 'P', 'T', 'R', 'K', 'K']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix with a side length of at least 3 and output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square found is at position (4, 10). However, let's ensure that this is indeed the correct and unique solution by reviewing the logic and confirming the result.\n\n### Review and Verification\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8 rows by 14 columns.\n\n2. **Square Detection Logic**: The code iterates over each possible top-left corner and checks for squares of increasing size, starting from 3. It verifies if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**: The result (4, 10) suggests that the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is found with its bottom-right corner at this position.\n\n4. **Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we should ensure that no other larger square exists.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the matrix and the logic applied, the result (4, 10) is consistent with the requirement to find the bottom-right corner of the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. The code correctly identifies this position based on the constraints provided.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 10]>>>"
