    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character in the given matrix with a side length of at least 3. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.\n2. For each element, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. For each potential square, verify if all elements in the square are the same.\n4. If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'F', 'Q', 'G', 'Q', 'B', 'D', 'Z', 'X', 'D', 'N', 'J'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'I', 'D', 'M', 'O', 'B', 'U', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'Q'],\n    ['F', 'N', 'V', 'I', 'F', 'S', 'T', 'P', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'V'],\n    ['V', 'E', 'Y', 'B', 'Y', 'V', 'K', 'H', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'H'],\n    ['I', 'Q', 'D', 'W', 'Q', 'L', 'D', 'R', 'P', 'B', 'D', 'O'],\n    ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'D', 'E', 'G', 'O', 'N', 'I', 'D', 'D', 'R'],\n    ['R', 'Q', 'K', 'R', 'C', 'I', 'W', 'G', 'S', 'P', 'A', 'H']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 is at position [3, 10]. However, let's verify this result by reasoning through the matrix to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Textual Reasoning\n\n1. **Matrix Overview**: The matrix is a 7x12 grid of characters.\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find a square of the same character with a side length of at least 3.\n3. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the solution is unique, so there should be only one such square.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's manually verify the result by examining the matrix:\n\n- The matrix has a sequence of 'S' characters starting from position (1, 8) to (3, 10).\n- This forms a 3x3 square of 'S' characters:\n  ```\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is indeed at position (3, 10).\n\nGiven this verification, the code's output is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 10]>>>"
