    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. We will iterate through the matrix and check for potential squares starting from each position. If a square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, the matrix is 8 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Matrix**: We will iterate through each element of the matrix, considering it as the potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed. This involves checking if all elements in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need at least a 3x3 area to form a square of side 3\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'E', 'L', 'F', 'L', 'B'],\n    ['Q', 'V', 'L', 'Q', 'F', 'X'],\n    ['T', 'P', 'K', 'J', 'U', 'R'],\n    ['D', 'Q', 'D', 'W', 'A', 'Y'],\n    ['W', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'S'],\n    ['A', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'Y', 'E'],\n    ['B', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'G', 'J'],\n    ['V', 'R', 'T', 'I', 'X', 'M']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the square.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is at row 6, column 3.\n\n<<<[6, 3]>>>"
