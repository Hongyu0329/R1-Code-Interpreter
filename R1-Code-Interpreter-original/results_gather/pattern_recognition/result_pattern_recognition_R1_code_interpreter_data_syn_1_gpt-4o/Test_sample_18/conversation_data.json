    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corners**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each cell as a potential top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'M', 'O', 'G', 'B', 'C', 'W', 'G', 'L', 'P'],\n    ['E', 'P', 'C', 'S', 'M', 'W', 'V', 'D', 'K', 'J'],\n    ['L', 'O', 'L', 'V', 'Y', 'U', 'J', 'B', 'V', 'H'],\n    ['Z', 'Q', 'K', 'T', 'I', 'A', 'Y', 'E', 'G', 'R'],\n    ['H', 'H', 'Q', 'O', 'S', 'W', 'J', 'N', 'C', 'M'],\n    ['Q', 'V', 'I', 'T', 'C', 'G', 'Y', 'S', 'X', 'O'],\n    ['P', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'D', 'E', 'W', 'M', 'B', 'S'],\n    ['A', 'L', 'R', 'M', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'M', 'A', 'Y'],\n    ['P', 'C', 'Z', 'B', 'E', 'B', 'S', 'G', 'I', 'X'],\n    ['B', 'F', 'Y', 'O', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'C', 'D'],\n    ['V', 'K', 'E', 'G', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'Y', 'C'],\n    ['G', 'D', 'R', 'P', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'Z', 'N'],\n    ['V', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'T', 'W'],\n    ['R', 'B', 'P', 'K', 'B', 'Y', 'M', 'N', 'L', 'Y'],\n    ['Y', 'J', 'Z', 'Z', 'Q', 'P', 'X', 'R', 'P', 'Z']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.
