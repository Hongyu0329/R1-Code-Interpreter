    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: Ensure that all characters in the potential square are the same.\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner coordinates.\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the identified square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need at least a 3x3 matrix to form a square of side 3\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'H', 'P', 'T', 'T', 'K', 'A', 'S'],\n    ['B', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'D', 'I', 'J', 'W'],\n    ['U', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'A', 'A', 'E', 'A'],\n    ['O', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'T', 'T', 'Y', 'S'],\n    ['D', 'M', 'Z', 'V', 'D', 'Z', 'Y', 'V'],\n    ['S', 'C', 'T', 'W', 'H', 'C', 'Z', 'P'],\n    ['K', 'M', 'N', 'Q', 'E', 'H', 'D', 'N'],\n    ['E', 'K', 'S', 'X', 'A', 'U', 'I', 'D'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'D', 'S', 'V', 'J', 'P', 'J'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'S', 'I', 'T', 'I', 'V', 'Z'],\n    ['R', 'Z', 'L', 'W', 'Y', 'J', 'D', 'E']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the square\nresult = find_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3. The output is `[3, 3]`, which corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the square in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 3]>>>"
