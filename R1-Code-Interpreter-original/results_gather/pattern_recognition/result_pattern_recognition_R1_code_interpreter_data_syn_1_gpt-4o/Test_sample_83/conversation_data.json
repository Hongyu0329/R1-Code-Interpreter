    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as the potential top-left corner of a square.\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n4. **Validate Square**: Ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n5. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n6. **Output the Result**: Once all possibilities are checked, output the bottom-right corner of the largest square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'W', 'V', 'B', 'X', 'J', 'K', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'L', 'Q'],\n    ['I', 'T', 'T', 'I', 'S', 'N', 'S', 'T', 'N', 'P', 'L', 'H', 'H'],\n    ['E', 'W', 'R', 'A', 'K', 'B', 'T', 'F', 'X', 'N', 'V', 'Z', 'X'],\n    ['M', 'Y', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'H', 'Q', 'E', 'C', 'F', 'P', 'N', 'B'],\n    ['R', 'A', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'K', 'I', 'C', 'Q', 'P', 'E', 'E', 'Q'],\n    ['V', 'O', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'O', 'Z', 'O', 'E', 'P', 'H', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'S', 'Q', 'W', 'A', 'K', 'P', 'Y', 'B', 'Z', 'R', 'U'],\n    ['F', 'K', 'R', 'W', 'Q', 'E', 'N', 'O', 'W', 'K', 'F', 'Z', 'R'],\n    ['B', 'Z', 'X', 'W', 'V', 'L', 'C', 'X', 'G', 'I', 'H', 'X', 'F']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix with sides of at least 3, composed of the same character, and return the bottom-right corner of that square.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with sides of at least 3, composed of the same character, in the given matrix. The result is the coordinates (5, 4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 4]>>>"
