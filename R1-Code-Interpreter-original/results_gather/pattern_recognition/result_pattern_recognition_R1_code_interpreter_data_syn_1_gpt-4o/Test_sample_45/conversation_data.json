    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nThe matrix provided is:\n\n```\nY Y J F J V M\nC O D K W M P\nF B K K K A O\nU P K K K X H\nF R K K K J Y\nS Y M C V P G\n```\n\nWe will iterate over the matrix and check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3. For each potential square, we will verify if all characters in the square are the same. If a valid square is found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this task:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_square_size = min(rows, cols)\n    result = None\n\n    for size in range(3, max_square_size + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    result = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['Y', 'Y', 'J', 'F', 'J', 'V', 'M'],\n    ['C', 'O', 'D', 'K', 'W', 'M', 'P'],\n    ['F', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'A', 'O'],\n    ['U', 'P', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'X', 'H'],\n    ['F', 'R', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'J', 'Y'],\n    ['S', 'Y', 'M', 'C', 'V', 'P', 'G']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 composed of the same character. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, is at position (4, 4). \n\nThis means that there is a 3x3 square of the character 'K' in the matrix, and its bottom-right corner is located at row 4, column 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 4]>>>"
