    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible square sizes and positions.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and check for squares of increasing size. For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of the same character can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we can output the first valid square found with the required properties.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = min(rows, cols)\n    \n    for size in range(3, max_size + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'Q', 'P', 'W', 'M', 'D', 'P', 'W'],\n    ['O', 'S', 'C', 'T', 'A', 'O', 'Y', 'B'],\n    ['F', 'M', 'Q', 'Q', 'L', 'I', 'S', 'R'],\n    ['K', 'Y', 'D', 'P', 'B', 'W', 'E', 'A'],\n    ['O', 'I', 'C', 'U', 'X', 'S', 'H', 'I'],\n    ['R', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'C', 'L', 'T', 'I'],\n    ['K', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'G', 'Z', 'E', 'W'],\n    ['X', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'L', 'Z', 'M', 'D'],\n    ['S', 'W', 'O', 'X', 'E', 'V', 'H', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'I', 'W', 'J', 'O', 'I', 'Z'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'N', 'W', 'S'],\n    ['L', 'D', 'X', 'Q', 'O', 'T', 'C', 'N']\n]\n\nprint(find_largest_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3. The output `[7, 3]` indicates the position of the bottom-right corner of the square in the matrix.\n\nThe square is composed of the character 'H', and its top-left corner starts at position `[5, 1]` with a side length of 3, extending to the bottom-right corner at `[7, 3]`.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 3]>>>"
