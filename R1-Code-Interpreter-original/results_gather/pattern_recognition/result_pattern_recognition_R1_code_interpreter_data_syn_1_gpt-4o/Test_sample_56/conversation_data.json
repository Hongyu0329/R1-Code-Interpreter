    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each candidate square, ensure all characters in the square are the same.\n4. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'S', 'I', 'K', 'M', 'K', 'S', 'W'],\n    ['I', 'Q', 'B', 'C', 'M', 'P', 'M', 'P'],\n    ['M', 'Q', 'W', 'J', 'O', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['R', 'O', 'B', 'Q', 'E', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['P', 'D', 'B', 'A', 'R', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['Q', 'P', 'C', 'D', 'O', 'H', 'J', 'P']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix with sides of at least length 3, composed of the same character, and output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the largest square with sides of at least length 3, composed of the same character. The output `(4, 7)` indicates the row and column of this corner in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[4, 7]>>>"
