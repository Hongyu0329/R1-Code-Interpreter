    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible top-left corners of squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the square does not exceed the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Store Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'S', 'A', 'F', 'O', 'U', 'I', 'T', 'C'],\n    ['Y', 'Z', 'N', 'H', 'Y', 'B', 'B', 'G', 'O'],\n    ['S', 'J', 'C', 'X', 'H', 'C', 'T', 'Q', 'I'],\n    ['K', 'S', 'W', 'F', 'C', 'S', 'P', 'G', 'X'],\n    ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'Y', 'Q', 'A', 'Y', 'G'],\n    ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'M', 'S', 'M', 'K', 'M'],\n    ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'S', 'O', 'P', 'G', 'H'],\n    ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'A', 'Y', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['D', 'X', 'V', 'U', 'X', 'R', 'A', 'L', 'T'],\n    ['T', 'B', 'M', 'F', 'J', 'B', 'H', 'W', 'Q'],\n    ['B', 'N', 'Z', 'K', 'Y', 'T', 'D', 'E', 'Q'],\n    ['Y', 'E', 'T', 'Z', 'T', 'M', 'E', 'Z', 'K'],\n    ['W', 'A', 'R', 'T', 'V', 'X', 'Z', 'H', 'X']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the output `(7, 3)`, which indicates the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found in the matrix. This square is composed of the same character and has a side length of at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 3]>>>"
