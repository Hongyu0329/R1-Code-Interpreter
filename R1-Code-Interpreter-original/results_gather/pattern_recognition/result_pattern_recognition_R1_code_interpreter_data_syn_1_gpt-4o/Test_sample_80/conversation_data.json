    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size can be formed.\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential square, verify that all characters on the boundary of the square are the same.\n4. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if a square of this size can be formed\n                valid_square = True\n                # Check the right and bottom boundaries of the square\n                for k in range(size):\n                    if matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] != current_char or matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] != current_char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    if size > max_size:\n                        max_size = size\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n                else:\n                    break\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'Y', 'Q', 'R', 'K', 'V', 'A', 'Q', 'Z', 'C', 'J'],\n    ['S', 'K', 'F', 'C', 'N', 'U', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'I'],\n    ['M', 'O', 'B', 'Q', 'Q', 'P', 'G', 'B', 'I', 'Y', 'W'],\n    ['I', 'Y', 'J', 'B', 'G', 'P', 'B', 'D', 'Z', 'G', 'G'],\n    ['I', 'Z', 'U', 'L', 'Y', 'P', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'T'],\n    ['C', 'V', 'P', 'H', 'M', 'V', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'P'],\n    ['M', 'H', 'I', 'T', 'Q', 'U', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'U'],\n    ['Z', 'D', 'L', 'X', 'G', 'D', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'D'],\n    ['H', 'Q', 'W', 'W', 'P', 'N', 'U', 'X', 'I', 'L', 'W'],\n    ['L', 'G', 'I', 'Q', 'Y', 'P', 'E', 'W', 'B', 'U', 'Y'],\n    ['B', 'Z', 'F', 'S', 'K', 'E', 'V', 'K', 'D', 'T', 'M'],\n    ['B', 'Z', 'P', 'V', 'J', 'U', 'U', 'Y', 'H', 'V', 'Q']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3. The coordinates of this corner are (7, 9).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 9]>>>"
