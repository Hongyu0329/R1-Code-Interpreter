    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n4. **Validate Square**: Ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n5. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with (i, j) as the top-left corner\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size + 1):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size + 1):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != current_char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square:\n                    if size + 1 > max_size:\n                        max_size = size + 1\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size, j + size)\n                else:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'Y', 'V', 'F', 'O', 'X', 'U', 'Q', 'Y'],\n    ['B', 'Y', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'Z', 'Y', 'F', 'X', 'G', 'G', 'Z', 'M', 'I'],\n    ['L', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'J', 'L', 'M', 'S', 'U', 'G', 'E', 'T', 'X'],\n    ['B', 'S', 'T', 'R', 'E', 'U', 'S', 'A', 'O', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'X', 'A'],\n    ['N', 'F', 'T', 'S', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'C', 'W', 'Q', 'V', 'T', 'A', 'H'],\n    ['T', 'D', 'V', 'U', 'H', 'M', 'E', 'H', 'S', 'Q', 'Q', 'R', 'Z', 'O']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix. The output `(2, 4)` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 2, column 4.\n\nLet's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[2, 4]>>>"
