    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us in iterating through the matrix and checking for possible squares.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Matrix**: We will iterate through each element of the matrix and consider it as the top-left corner of a potential square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed. We will ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X', 'V', 'M', 'P', 'Z', 'I', 'V', 'L'],\n    ['P', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'H', 'E', 'M', 'X', 'Q', 'P', 'W'],\n    ['R', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'C', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'O', 'T', 'D', 'S'],\n    ['N', 'I', 'B', 'O', 'X', 'T', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'V', 'A', 'T'],\n    ['U', 'T', 'X', 'P', 'E', 'Y', 'U', 'Y', 'P', 'F', 'N', 'F'],\n    ['H', 'B', 'Z', 'I', 'M', 'N', 'X', 'Y', 'A', 'G', 'J', 'W']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output is `[2, 3]`, which corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the square formed by the character 'E' in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 3]>>>"
