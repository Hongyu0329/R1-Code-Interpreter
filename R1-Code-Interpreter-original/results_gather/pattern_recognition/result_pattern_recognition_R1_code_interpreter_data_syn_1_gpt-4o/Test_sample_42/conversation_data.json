    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of at least 3x3 in the given character matrix where all characters in the square are the same. We will iterate through the matrix and check for such squares, keeping track of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n2. **Iterate through the Matrix**: For each element in the matrix, consider it as the top-left corner of a potential square.\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n4. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the entire matrix is processed, output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['W', 'E', 'B', 'P', 'M', 'L'],\n    ['E', 'R', 'Q', 'T', 'S', 'L'],\n    ['Z', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'D', 'H'],\n    ['R', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'F', 'A'],\n    ['K', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'N', 'F'],\n    ['R', 'K', 'R', 'V', 'D', 'J'],\n    ['J', 'W', 'T', 'E', 'W', 'J'],\n    ['E', 'A', 'M', 'R', 'E', 'K']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3. The result is (4, 3), which corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the square composed of the character 'V'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 3]>>>"
