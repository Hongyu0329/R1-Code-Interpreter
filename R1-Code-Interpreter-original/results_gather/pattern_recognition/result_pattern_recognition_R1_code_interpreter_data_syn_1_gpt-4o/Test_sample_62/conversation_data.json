    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, the matrix is 10x8 (10 rows and 8 columns).\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is found, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'N', 'V', 'J', 'R', 'J', 'G', 'U'],\n    ['A', 'X', 'R', 'D', 'B', 'W', 'L', 'Z'],\n    ['K', 'F', 'T', 'V', 'B', 'C', 'S', 'J'],\n    ['Q', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'F', 'X', 'H', 'S'],\n    ['S', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'A', 'M', 'A'],\n    ['H', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'S', 'M', 'Y', 'F'],\n    ['Q', 'G', 'H', 'Y', 'V', 'U', 'Y', 'H'],\n    ['A', 'C', 'O', 'U', 'L', 'Z', 'J', 'C'],\n    ['M', 'O', 'O', 'Q', 'N', 'N', 'O', 'H'],\n    ['X', 'Y', 'C', 'H', 'H', 'U', 'E', 'R']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix. The square is composed of the character 'I' and is located with its bottom-right corner at row 5, column 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 3]>>>"
