    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible top-left corners of squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For a square to be valid, all characters in the square must be the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square.\n\n4. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                valid_square = True\n                # Check the new row and column added to the square\n                for k in range(size + 1):\n                    if matrix[i + size][j + k] != current_char or matrix[i + k][j + size] != current_char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    size += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            # Update the largest square found\n            if size > max_size:\n                max_size = size\n                bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'F', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['E', 'T', 'Y', 'G', 'F', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['U', 'G', 'P', 'S', 'F', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['W', 'E', 'A', 'V', 'P', 'A', 'I'],\n    ['J', 'W', 'E', 'F', 'A', 'Q', 'V'],\n    ['F', 'S', 'G', 'J', 'K', 'Y', 'Y'],\n    ['S', 'P', 'Q', 'N', 'B', 'U', 'K'],\n    ['W', 'A', 'G', 'Z', 'Z', 'H', 'Z']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the output `(2, 6)`, which indicates the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found in the matrix. \n\nGiven the problem statement and the matrix provided, this output represents the correct position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 6]>>>"
