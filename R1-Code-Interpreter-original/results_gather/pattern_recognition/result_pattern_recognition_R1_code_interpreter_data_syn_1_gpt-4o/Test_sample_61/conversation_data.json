    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to ensure we don't go out of bounds when checking for squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each position, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Z', 'W', 'P', 'T', 'I', 'V', 'J', 'I', 'Y'],\n    ['C', 'C', 'J', 'T', 'M', 'B', 'I', 'F', 'Y'],\n    ['Q', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'Q'],\n    ['J', 'L', 'C', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'J', 'B'],\n    ['U', 'V', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'D', 'N'],\n    ['M', 'G', 'I', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'S', 'Q'],\n    ['G', 'E', 'T', 'C', 'N', 'M', 'S', 'G', 'U'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'U', 'X', 'D', 'D', 'O', 'P', 'A'],\n    ['H', 'B', 'I', 'R', 'S', 'K', 'B', 'K', 'Z'],\n    ['U', 'N', 'W', 'Z', 'I', 'M', 'J', 'Z', 'Q'],\n    ['K', 'I', 'D', 'J', 'H', 'M', 'C', 'Y', 'R']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
