    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We need to check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3. For each potential top-left corner of a square, we will check if a square of the current size can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check possible square sizes starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['N', 'G', 'U', 'O', 'U', 'K', 'G', 'C', 'Z', 'N', 'Z'],\n    ['F', 'H', 'V', 'R', 'D', 'X', 'T', 'N', 'P', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'Y', 'T', 'T', 'D', 'B', 'F', 'Z', 'F'],\n    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'S', 'Q', 'U', 'K', 'M', 'R', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['B', 'B', 'B', 'E', 'H', 'V', 'U', 'U', 'H', 'N', 'B'],\n    ['F', 'O', 'S', 'R', 'Y', 'S', 'U', 'C', 'K', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['I', 'X', 'J', 'G', 'S', 'Y', 'B', 'K', 'M', 'E', 'B']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the bottom-right corner of the largest square.",
    "The code execution has provided the output `(4, 2)`, which indicates the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found in the matrix. \n\nGiven the matrix and the problem constraints, this result suggests that the largest square with sides of at least length 3, composed of the same character, has its bottom-right corner at row 4 and column 2.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 2]>>>"
