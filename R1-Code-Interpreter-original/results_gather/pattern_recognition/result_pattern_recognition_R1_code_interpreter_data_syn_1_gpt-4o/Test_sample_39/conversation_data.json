    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over the matrix elements.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each element in the matrix and check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with sides of at least length 3.\n\n3. **Check for Square Formation**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square can be formed by expanding downwards and rightwards, ensuring all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each element to consider it as the top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check possible square sizes starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # Update the largest square found\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'Z', 'X', 'B', 'F', 'N', 'A', 'V', 'R', 'R', 'D'],\n    ['M', 'O', 'K', 'C', 'Z', 'Q', 'E', 'I', 'R', 'R', 'I'],\n    ['V', 'A', 'C', 'Q', 'E', 'F', 'U', 'C', 'L', 'A', 'H'],\n    ['Z', 'K', 'G', 'O', 'O', 'A', 'N', 'R', 'W', 'Y', 'Q'],\n    ['K', 'Z', 'L', 'V', 'G', 'O', 'C', 'I', 'K', 'F', 'I'],\n    ['G', 'E', 'F', 'E', 'C', 'O', 'Y', 'Z', 'J', 'O', 'V'],\n    ['S', 'F', 'O', 'W', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'J', 'F', 'N', 'J'],\n    ['G', 'V', 'T', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'B', 'I', 'X'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'P', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'L', 'Q', 'Z'],\n    ['E', 'K', 'Q', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'H', 'V', 'M'],\n    ['D', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'B', 'T', 'G'],\n    ['A', 'B', 'Q', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'N', 'W', 'F'],\n    ['I', 'Q', 'R', 'K', 'G', 'T', 'Y', 'P', 'T', 'X', 'K']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.

    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3. The coordinates of this corner are (11, 7).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[11, 7]>>>"
