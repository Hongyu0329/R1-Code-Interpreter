    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us iterate over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'U', 'Z', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'N', 'T'],\n    ['A', 'H', 'O', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'M', 'N'],\n    ['R', 'A', 'J', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'Q', 'G'],\n    ['K', 'J', 'X', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'V', 'L'],\n    ['V', 'Y', 'L', 'Q', 'E', 'K', 'D', 'P', 'Y'],\n    ['O', 'J', 'P', 'E', 'X', 'I', 'P', 'V', 'R'],\n    ['T', 'H', 'V', 'B', 'Z', 'V', 'P', 'A', 'A'],\n    ['X', 'D', 'C', 'H', 'S', 'D', 'H', 'S', 'C'],\n    ['P', 'R', 'Q', 'Y', 'Q', 'O', 'Y', 'N', 'C'],\n    ['X', 'A', 'O', 'M', 'R', 'K', 'D', 'X', 'I'],\n    ['C', 'A', 'H', 'X', 'G', 'L', 'S', 'L', 'F'],\n    ['Q', 'O', 'R', 'U', 'P', 'N', 'B', 'I', 'X'],\n    ['D', 'R', 'Y', 'S', 'W', 'Q', 'W', 'W', 'E'],\n    ['Q', 'V', 'Y', 'Y', 'A', 'Q', 'V', 'H', 'O'],\n    ['N', 'I', 'V', 'N', 'V', 'X', 'O', 'Q', 'D']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3. The result is the coordinates of this corner.\n\nThe output `(3, 6)` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the largest square is located at row 3 and column 6 in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 6]>>>"
