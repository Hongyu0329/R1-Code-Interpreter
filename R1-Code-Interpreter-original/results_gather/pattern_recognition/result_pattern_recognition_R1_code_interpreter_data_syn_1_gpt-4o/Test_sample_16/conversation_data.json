    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for our search.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner can be any cell in the matrix that allows for a square of at least size 3x3 to fit.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, return the bottom-right corner\n                if is_square:\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'O', 'T', 'I', 'A', 'S'],\n    ['D', 'Y', 'R', 'B', 'U', 'O'],\n    ['Y', 'M', 'S', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['N', 'G', 'H', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['Q', 'S', 'X', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'],\n    ['V', 'P', 'M', 'K', 'Z', 'J'],\n    ['E', 'X', 'X', 'M', 'F', 'N']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output `[4, 5]` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is located at row 4 and column 5.\n\n<<<[4, 5]>>>"
