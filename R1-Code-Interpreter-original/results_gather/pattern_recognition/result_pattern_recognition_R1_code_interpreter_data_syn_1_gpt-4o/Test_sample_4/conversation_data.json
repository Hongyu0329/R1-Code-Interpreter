    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, i.e., the number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all the characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['X', 'R', 'C', 'H', 'H', 'E', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'E', 'N', 'A'],\n    ['D', 'L', 'W', 'I', 'Q', 'R', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'V', 'G', 'P'],\n    ['Y', 'D', 'R', 'J', 'L', 'D', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'R', 'Q', 'B'],\n    ['A', 'D', 'C', 'S', 'J', 'W', 'S', 'G', 'O', 'T', 'Q', 'V'],\n    ['G', 'Y', 'J', 'O', 'G', 'U', 'Z', 'C', 'H', 'E', 'H', 'G'],\n    ['I', 'H', 'X', 'N', 'R', 'M', 'Q', 'Z', 'G', 'J', 'V', 'U'],\n    ['O', 'H', 'L', 'O', 'Y', 'A', 'W', 'I', 'M', 'W', 'F', 'J']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character, and output its coordinates.",
