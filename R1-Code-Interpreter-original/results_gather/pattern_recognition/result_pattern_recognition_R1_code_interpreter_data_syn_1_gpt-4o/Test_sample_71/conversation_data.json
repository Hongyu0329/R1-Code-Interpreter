    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, verify that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the identified square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # We need to find the largest square with the same character\n    for size in range(min(rows, cols), 2, -1):  # Start from the largest possible size\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'L', 'M', 'H', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'S', 'T', 'Y', 'L', 'P'],\n    ['A', 'C', 'L', 'O', 'U', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'X', 'I', 'O', 'T'],\n    ['H', 'F', 'W', 'S', 'C', 'B', 'C', 'W', 'D', 'V', 'U', 'G'],\n    ['K', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'Q', 'S', 'Y', 'Z', 'U', 'Q', 'E'],\n    ['C', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'O', 'O', 'E', 'S', 'A', 'P', 'I'],\n    ['N', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'W', 'V', 'Z', 'M', 'D', 'Q'],\n    ['Q', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'S', 'W', 'R', 'Y', 'T', 'O', 'N'],\n    ['N', 'Z', 'C', 'Z', 'Z', 'V', 'N', 'C', 'R', 'L', 'F', 'P']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square of the same character with a side length of at least 3 and return the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
