    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n4. **Validate Square**: Ensure that all characters in the potential square are the same.\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n6. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the first valid square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, return the bottom-right corner\n                if valid_square:\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'X', 'A', 'L', 'J', 'V', 'X', 'Y', 'Y', 'L', 'R', 'U', 'X', 'I'],\n    ['E', 'G', 'D', 'U', 'Y', 'T', 'C', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'L', 'I', 'U'],\n    ['K', 'X', 'S', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'D', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'U', 'S', 'R'],\n    ['F', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'F', 'O', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'C', 'E'],\n    ['C', 'K', 'W', 'Z', 'C', 'V', 'Y', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'K', 'D'],\n    ['H', 'E', 'N', 'J', 'Y', 'T', 'O', 'V', 'M', 'U', 'O', 'Y', 'J', 'J'],\n    ['R', 'A', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'K', 'K', 'I', 'K', 'I', 'O', 'P', 'D', 'P'],\n    ['E', 'M', 'G', 'B', 'E', 'E', 'G', 'X', 'G', 'P', 'T', 'R', 'K', 'K']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output `[3, 9]` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is located at row 3 and column 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 9]>>>"
