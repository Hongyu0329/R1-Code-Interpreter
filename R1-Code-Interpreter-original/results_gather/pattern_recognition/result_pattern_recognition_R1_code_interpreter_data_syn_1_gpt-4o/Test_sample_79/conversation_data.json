    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for our search.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner can be any cell in the matrix, but we need to ensure that there is enough space to form a square of at least size 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            max_size = min(rows - i, cols - j)\n            for size in range(3, max_size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Record the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    bottom_right = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n                    return bottom_right\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['O', 'G', 'U', 'F', 'B', 'F', 'C'],\n    ['M', 'O', 'M', 'K', 'M', 'F', 'D'],\n    ['X', 'V', 'N', 'C', 'I', 'P', 'M'],\n    ['U', 'Z', 'U', 'G', 'P', 'U', 'A'],\n    ['E', 'C', 'Q', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['G', 'P', 'A', 'E', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['U', 'D', 'Y', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C'],\n    ['R', 'S', 'G', 'W', 'F', 'A', 'Z']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the square\nresult = find_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output `(6, 6)` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is located at row 6, column 6.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[6, 6]>>>"
