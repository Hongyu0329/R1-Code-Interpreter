    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with the top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if the square of size (size+1)x(size+1) is valid\n                valid_square = True\n                for k in range(size + 1):\n                    if matrix[i + size][j + k] != current_char or matrix[i + k][j + size] != current_char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    size += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            # Update the largest square found\n            if size > max_size:\n                max_size = size\n                bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'P', 'U', 'S', 'N', 'S', 'A'],\n    ['L', 'C', 'S', 'P', 'E', 'X', 'M'],\n    ['I', 'F', 'Z', 'C', 'A', 'K', 'S'],\n    ['Y', 'E', 'C', 'H', 'B', 'M', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'C', 'F', 'C', 'C', 'Q', 'F'],\n    ['R', 'J', 'F', 'M', 'X', 'X', 'K'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'U', 'Q', 'M'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'K', 'F'],\n    ['I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'U', 'P', 'D'],\n    ['Q', 'L', 'F', 'A', 'R', 'W', 'K'],\n    ['X', 'P', 'A', 'X', 'I', 'U', 'Z'],\n    ['T', 'Z', 'U', 'X', 'P', 'B', 'F']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix with a side length of at least 3. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output `(8, 2)` indicates that the bottom-right corner of this square is located at row 8 and column 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 2]>>>"
