    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. In this case, it's a 10x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square of the required size.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['F', 'N', 'U', 'V', 'P', 'Q'],\n    ['C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'V', 'D'],\n    ['Y', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'R'],\n    ['Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'S', 'J'],\n    ['C', 'N', 'C', 'H', 'L', 'O'],\n    ['O', 'S', 'A', 'Z', 'Y', 'H'],\n    ['C', 'E', 'J', 'R', 'Y', 'Z'],\n    ['X', 'A', 'V', 'N', 'P', 'E'],\n    ['O', 'K', 'D', 'Q', 'Q', 'I'],\n    ['E', 'H', 'G', 'N', 'P', 'F']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The square is composed of the character 'I', and its bottom-right corner is at position [3, 3].\n\n<<<[3, 3]>>>"
