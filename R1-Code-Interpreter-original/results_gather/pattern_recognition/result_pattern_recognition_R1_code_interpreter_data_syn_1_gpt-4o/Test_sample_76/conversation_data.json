    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us in iterating over possible top-left corners of squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the detected square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, return the bottom-right corner\n                if is_square:\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['P', 'T', 'R', 'Z', 'B', 'V'],\n    ['P', 'L', 'R', 'U', 'Q', 'U'],\n    ['X', 'M', 'C', 'R', 'D', 'Y'],\n    ['N', 'E', 'A', 'S', 'W', 'X'],\n    ['C', 'I', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'Y'],\n    ['J', 'F', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'Y'],\n    ['H', 'G', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'E'],\n    ['R', 'N', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'N'],\n    ['W', 'F', 'L', 'M', 'L', 'E'],\n    ['Z', 'W', 'C', 'Z', 'J', 'I']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over the matrix, checking for squares of the same character with a minimum size of 3x3, and return the bottom-right corner of the first such square it finds. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the coordinates `[6, 4]`, which represent the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 4]>>>"
