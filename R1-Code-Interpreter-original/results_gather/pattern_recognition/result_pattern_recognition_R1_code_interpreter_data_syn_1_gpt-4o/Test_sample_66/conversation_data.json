    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character in the given matrix with a side length of at least 3. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, ensure all characters are the same.\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we can output the first valid square found.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'Y', 'E', 'O', 'Q', 'B', 'O', 'N'],\n    ['P', 'P', 'D', 'M', 'B', 'F', 'X', 'P'],\n    ['J', 'E', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['V', 'G', 'C', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'W'],\n    ['H', 'Z', 'K', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['J', 'V', 'L', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'E'],\n    ['K', 'Y', 'N', 'Z', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'B'],\n    ['F', 'R', 'T', 'N', 'W', 'X', 'O', 'T'],\n    ['T', 'A', 'D', 'X', 'U', 'N', 'U', 'U'],\n    ['X', 'B', 'X', 'E', 'Y', 'M', 'R', 'W']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through the matrix, checking for squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3, and return the bottom-right corner of the first such square found. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
