    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us iterate over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from 3x3 squares\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size + 1):\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                    for y in range(j, j + size + 1):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != current_char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                if valid_square:\n                    if size + 1 > max_size:\n                        max_size = size + 1\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size, j + size)\n                else:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['E', 'N', 'W', 'Y', 'F', 'A', 'R'],\n    ['O', 'C', 'Z', 'U', 'J', 'D', 'Y'],\n    ['Z', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'P'],\n    ['N', 'J', 'S', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'A'],\n    ['M', 'H', 'H', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'S'],\n    ['P', 'W', 'A', 'A', 'P', 'M', 'U'],\n    ['R', 'P', 'S', 'F', 'M', 'P', 'B'],\n    ['H', 'T', 'B', 'C', 'X', 'J', 'B'],\n    ['O', 'Z', 'X', 'A', 'P', 'E', 'V']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully executed and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output `(4, 5)` indicates that the bottom-right corner of this square is located at row 4, column 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 5]>>>"
