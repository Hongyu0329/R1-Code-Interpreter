    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for searching squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from each position in the matrix and attempt to form squares of increasing size.\n   - For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**:\n   - For a square starting at position `(i, j)` with side length `l`, ensure that all characters in the sub-matrix from `(i, j)` to `(i+l-1, j+l-1)` are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Largest Valid Square**:\n   - Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_side = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (0, 0)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible starting point for a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for l in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + l):\n                    for y in range(j, j + l):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, check if it's the largest\n                if valid_square and l > max_side:\n                    max_side = l\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + l - 1, j + l - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['Y', 'V', 'F', 'S', 'F', 'A', 'T', 'P'],\n    ['M', 'X', 'Z', 'P', 'Z', 'D', 'O', 'T'],\n    ['U', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'U', 'M', 'E', 'Y'],\n    ['E', 'T', 'A', 'G', 'Z', 'Q', 'A', 'L'],\n    ['F', 'R', 'R', 'H', 'R', 'P', 'R', 'P'],\n    ['G', 'T', 'K', 'T', 'Z', 'W', 'W', 'W'],\n    ['M', 'S', 'E', 'L', 'Z', 'W', 'W', 'W'],\n    ['E', 'G', 'Y', 'W', 'S', 'W', 'W', 'W'],\n    ['Z', 'H', 'T', 'K', 'F', 'F', 'Y', 'S'],\n    ['O', 'R', 'V', 'H', 'V', 'S', 'S', 'V'],\n    ['F', 'J', 'X', 'J', 'X', 'X', 'B', 'R'],\n    ['C', 'O', 'G', 'T', 'J', 'G', 'L', 'K'],\n    ['A', 'A', 'R', 'R', 'D', 'L', 'R', 'I']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.
