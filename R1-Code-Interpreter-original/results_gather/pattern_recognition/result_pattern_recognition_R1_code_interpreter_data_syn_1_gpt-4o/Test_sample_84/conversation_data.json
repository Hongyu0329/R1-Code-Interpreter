    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, i.e., the number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = min(rows, cols)\n    result = None\n\n    for size in range(3, max_size + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    result = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'L', 'R', 'S', 'D', 'A', 'J', 'D', 'K', 'K'],\n    ['D', 'Z', 'O', 'T', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'I', 'I', 'L'],\n    ['T', 'J', 'X', 'K', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'W'],\n    ['Q', 'Z', 'A', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'Q'],\n    ['L', 'W', 'R', 'U', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'S'],\n    ['Y', 'M', 'X', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'N'],\n    ['P', 'E', 'I', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F'],\n    ['X', 'F', 'K', 'C', 'W', 'J', 'R', 'W', 'N', 'P'],\n    ['S', 'B', 'P', 'M', 'V', 'J', 'S', 'S', 'L', 'L'],\n    ['C', 'S', 'M', 'U', 'Z', 'U', 'U', 'T', 'F', 'W'],\n    ['E', 'R', 'J', 'A', 'S', 'P', 'T', 'Z', 'L', 'S'],\n    ['X', 'C', 'L', 'R', 'Y', 'L', 'B', 'X', 'W', 'I']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The result is the coordinates (6, 8).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 8]>>>"
