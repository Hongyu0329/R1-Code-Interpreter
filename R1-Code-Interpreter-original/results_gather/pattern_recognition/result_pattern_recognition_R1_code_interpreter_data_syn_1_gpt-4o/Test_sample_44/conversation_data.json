    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us iterate over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner\n                if valid_square:\n                    bottom_right = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n                    return bottom_right\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'M', 'Q', 'A', 'J', 'N', 'Z', 'I', 'B', 'F', 'H', 'W', 'M', 'W'],\n    ['A', 'V', 'O', 'A', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'M', 'X', 'B', 'C', 'N', 'M', 'V'],\n    ['X', 'Z', 'Z', 'D', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'S', 'V', 'J', 'N', 'R', 'D', 'L'],\n    ['S', 'Z', 'T', 'O', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'P', 'M', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'D', 'T'],\n    ['B', 'W', 'O', 'Q', 'E', 'I', 'B', 'A', 'K', 'A', 'Q', 'X', 'N', 'T'],\n    ['K', 'O', 'V', 'B', 'U', 'G', 'O', 'B', 'Q', 'S', 'F', 'R', 'U', 'J']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The output `(3, 6)` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is located at row 3 and column 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 6]>>>"
