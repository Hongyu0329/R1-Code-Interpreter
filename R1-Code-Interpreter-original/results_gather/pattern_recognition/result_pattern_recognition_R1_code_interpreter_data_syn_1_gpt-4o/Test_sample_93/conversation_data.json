    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for searching squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n4. **Validate Square**: Ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square of the required size.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['A', 'S', 'U', 'A', 'X', 'S', 'D', 'F', 'L'],\n    ['W', 'X', 'M', 'U', 'N', 'C', 'X', 'F', 'E'],\n    ['E', 'B', 'B', 'P', 'S', 'N', 'Y', 'Z', 'N'],\n    ['F', 'T', 'J', 'O', 'V', 'O', 'D', 'P', 'E'],\n    ['F', 'Y', 'Q', 'I', 'R', 'P', 'N', 'L', 'Y'],\n    ['S', 'W', 'J', 'Y', 'X', 'C', 'P', 'V', 'P'],\n    ['K', 'O', 'Q', 'D', 'C', 'G', 'Z', 'B', 'U'],\n    ['F', 'Y', 'L', 'X', 'F', 'E', 'Z', 'S', 'H'],\n    ['E', 'W', 'O', 'J', 'R', 'X', 'O', 'E', 'X'],\n    ['O', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'S', 'U', 'V', 'X', 'G'],\n    ['Y', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'E', 'S', 'X', 'I', 'J'],\n    ['H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'I', 'I', 'R', 'W', 'U'],\n    ['E', 'O', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'Y', 'F', 'T', 'K'],\n    ['B', 'H', 'Z', 'I', 'Z', 'O', 'X', 'A', 'V']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
