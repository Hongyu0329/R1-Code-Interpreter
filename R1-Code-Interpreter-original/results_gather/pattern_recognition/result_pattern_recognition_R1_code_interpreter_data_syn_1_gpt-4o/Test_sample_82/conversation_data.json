    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, we need to determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the range of possible square sizes.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Validation**: For each potential square, we will check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Output**: Once we find a valid square with a side length of at least 3, we will record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_squares(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    min_size = 3\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(min_size, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    result.append((i + size - 1, j + size - 1))\n    \n    # Return the last found square's bottom-right corner\n    return result[-1] if result else None\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['P', 'S', 'K', 'Y', 'A', 'O', 'X', 'B', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['T', 'Y', 'Z', 'V', 'T', 'M', 'K', 'X', 'A', 'T'],\n    ['D', 'P', 'R', 'O', 'Z', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'Y', 'J'],\n    ['R', 'X', 'K', 'W', 'M', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'N', 'G'],\n    ['B', 'V', 'B', 'T', 'D', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'I'],\n    ['B', 'M', 'I', 'D', 'X', 'M', 'P', 'E', 'A', 'K']\n]\n\nresult = find_squares(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.
