    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible top-left corners of squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, ensure all characters are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['I', 'X', 'T', 'A', 'A', 'P'],\n    ['U', 'D', 'I', 'Z', 'J', 'Z'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'F', 'S', 'X', 'E'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'F', 'B', 'T', 'D'],\n    ['F', 'F', 'F', 'S', 'L', 'Q'],\n    ['O', 'I', 'X', 'V', 'H', 'Q'],\n    ['X', 'S', 'K', 'S', 'B', 'Y'],\n    ['D', 'V', 'K', 'D', 'Q', 'J'],\n    ['Q', 'Y', 'S', 'K', 'S', 'J']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over the matrix, checking for squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3, and return the bottom-right corner of the first such square it finds. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character. The output `[4, 2]` indicates the position of this corner in the matrix.\n\nThe square is formed by the character 'F', and its bottom-right corner is at row 4, column 2.\n\n<<<[4, 2]>>>"
