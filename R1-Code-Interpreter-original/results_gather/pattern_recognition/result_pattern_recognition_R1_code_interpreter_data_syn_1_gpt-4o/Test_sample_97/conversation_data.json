    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with the top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start with size 3x3, so we need to check size 2 (0-indexed)\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if the square of current size is valid\n                valid_square = True\n                for k in range(size + 1):\n                    if matrix[i + size][j + k] != current_char or matrix[i + k][j + size] != current_char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    if size + 1 > max_size:\n                        max_size = size + 1\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size, j + size)\n                else:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['Y', 'L', 'I', 'F', 'T', 'Q', 'D', 'Y', 'F', 'I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'V'],\n    ['F', 'S', 'H', 'W', 'Y', 'J', 'X', 'R', 'I', 'T', 'I', 'R', 'B', 'H'],\n    ['T', 'T', 'X', 'X', 'R', 'P', 'G', 'N', 'I', 'F', 'Q', 'T', 'N', 'A'],\n    ['D', 'T', 'C', 'N', 'U', 'V', 'G', 'E', 'D', 'E', 'J', 'Z', 'M', 'R'],\n    ['K', 'S', 'B', 'R', 'S', 'N', 'V', 'W', 'S', 'D', 'K', 'Y', 'W', 'J'],\n    ['M', 'H', 'P', 'E', 'A', 'D', 'M', 'V', 'X', 'N', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'P'],\n    ['D', 'Y', 'K', 'V', 'Q', 'H', 'N', 'U', 'A', 'X', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'A'],\n    ['Z', 'G', 'D', 'R', 'D', 'M', 'F', 'Z', 'M', 'B', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'W']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.
