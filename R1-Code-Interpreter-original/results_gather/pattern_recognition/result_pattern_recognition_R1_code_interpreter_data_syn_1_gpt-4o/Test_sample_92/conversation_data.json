    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us iterate over the matrix and check for possible squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as the potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record Bottom-Right Corners**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    largest_square_bottom_right = None\n    largest_size = 0\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > largest_size:\n                    largest_size = size\n                    largest_square_bottom_right = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return largest_square_bottom_right\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'G', 'H', 'D', 'K', 'T', 'M', 'T', 'X', 'T'],\n    ['X', 'N', 'B', 'F', 'Q', 'L', 'R', 'J', 'Z', 'K'],\n    ['D', 'T', 'Y', 'W', 'U', 'G', 'J', 'J', 'K', 'F'],\n    ['C', 'L', 'X', 'M', 'W', 'X', 'U', 'J', 'E', 'B'],\n    ['J', 'D', 'G', 'V', 'R', 'R', 'L', 'V', 'Z', 'N'],\n    ['I', 'P', 'T', 'M', 'B', 'L', 'U', 'T', 'F', 'B'],\n    ['Y', 'R', 'X', 'P', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'E'],\n    ['N', 'X', 'M', 'N', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'C'],\n    ['L', 'O', 'C', 'P', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'V'],\n    ['N', 'C', 'L', 'X', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'L'],\n    ['M', 'I', 'P', 'E', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'F'],\n    ['K', 'L', 'C', 'Z', 'A', 'Y', 'G', 'V', 'W', 'Z']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.
