    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, which are 11 rows and 6 columns in this case.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is found, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square\n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'Q', 'N', 'P', 'I', 'O'],\n    ['N', 'M', 'P', 'W', 'M', 'K'],\n    ['F', 'A', 'W', 'M', 'W', 'S'],\n    ['C', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'D', 'V'],\n    ['J', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'F', 'Z'],\n    ['W', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'N', 'I'],\n    ['I', 'Y', 'K', 'L', 'X', 'J'],\n    ['P', 'W', 'L', 'G', 'H', 'P'],\n    ['Q', 'U', 'M', 'G', 'D', 'Q'],\n    ['U', 'M', 'W', 'H', 'D', 'U'],\n    ['F', 'U', 'M', 'X', 'A', 'S']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the matrix. The coordinates of this corner are (5, 3).\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[5, 3]>>>"
