    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us in iterating through the matrix and checking for possible squares.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Matrix**: We will iterate through each element of the matrix and consider it as the top-left corner of a potential square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character. We will continue to increase the size until it is no longer possible to form a square.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares with top-left corner at (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size + 1):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size + 1):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != current_char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square:\n                    if size + 1 > max_size:\n                        max_size = size + 1\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size, j + size)\n                else:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['G', 'R', 'Z', 'K', 'I', 'V'],\n    ['C', 'J', 'H', 'B', 'Y', 'K'],\n    ['B', 'L', 'L', 'Q', 'U', 'X'],\n    ['U', 'O', 'R', 'Q', 'T', 'R'],\n    ['Z', 'E', 'L', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'J', 'J', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['C', 'Y', 'M', 'O', 'O', 'O']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The result is (6, 5), which corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the square composed of the character 'O'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 5]>>>"
