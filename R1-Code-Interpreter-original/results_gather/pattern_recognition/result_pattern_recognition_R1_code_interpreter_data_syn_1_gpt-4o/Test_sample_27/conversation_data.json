    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to solve this:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix, i.e., the number of rows and columns.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all the characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_square_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                # If a valid square is found, update the largest square info\n                if is_square and size > max_square_size:\n                    max_square_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['D', 'N', 'E', 'L', 'R', 'Z', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'O', 'P', 'Z', 'R'],\n    ['A', 'T', 'Q', 'D', 'M', 'M', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'H', 'D', 'P', 'K'],\n    ['U', 'U', 'U', 'A', 'V', 'D', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'Q', 'T', 'F', 'B'],\n    ['T', 'M', 'D', 'F', 'O', 'W', 'Y', 'C', 'O', 'N', 'P', 'G', 'D'],\n    ['L', 'V', 'S', 'N', 'L', 'X', 'X', 'B', 'Y', 'J', 'A', 'L', 'F'],\n    ['X', 'D', 'O', 'B', 'W', 'J', 'G', 'H', 'V', 'U', 'A', 'M', 'S'],\n    ['G', 'N', 'M', 'U', 'G', 'Z', 'P', 'R', 'U', 'D', 'J', 'B', 'Z'],\n    ['Z', 'G', 'M', 'A', 'Y', 'F', 'D', 'J', 'Z', 'L', 'O', 'F', 'N'],\n    ['C', 'Q', 'L', 'E', 'U', 'A', 'T', 'N', 'Q', 'S', 'V', 'O', 'O'],\n    ['L', 'A', 'X', 'M', 'X', 'D', 'R', 'L', 'X', 'C', 'T', 'A', 'S'],\n    ['V', 'W', 'F', 'K', 'W', 'E', 'P', 'K', 'V', 'W', 'D', 'U', 'Z'],\n    ['C', 'R', 'A', 'F', 'R', 'R', 'S', 'N', 'O', 'Q', 'C', 'G', 'S']\n]\n\n# Find the bottom-right corner of the largest square\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix with a side length of at least 3.
