    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each cell in the matrix, consider it as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n4. **Validate Square**: Ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n5. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with (i, j) as the top-left corner\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 2  # Start checking from size 3x3\n            while i + size < rows and j + size < cols:\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size + 1):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size + 1):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != current_char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square:\n                    if size + 1 > max_size:\n                        max_size = size + 1\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size, j + size)\n                else:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['S', 'P', 'W', 'I', 'W', 'H', 'N'],\n    ['U', 'L', 'S', 'P', 'N', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['M', 'V', 'H', 'H', 'N', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['I', 'R', 'I', 'F', 'N', 'N', 'N'],\n    ['W', 'M', 'I', 'D', 'F', 'P', 'S'],\n    ['T', 'H', 'X', 'M', 'U', 'K', 'C'],\n    ['Y', 'A', 'W', 'N', 'L', 'P', 'H'],\n    ['O', 'V', 'I', 'S', 'N', 'Q', 'T'],\n    ['T', 'K', 'O', 'S', 'E', 'L', 'I'],\n    ['B', 'Y', 'Y', 'G', 'N', 'B', 'S'],\n    ['U', 'Y', 'E', 'E', 'M', 'W', 'J'],\n    ['W', 'O', 'C', 'C', 'V', 'L', 'W']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the output `(3, 6)`, which indicates the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix.\n\nLet's verify the result:\n\n- The square is composed of the character 'N'.\n- The square starts at position (1, 4) and ends at position (3, 6).\n- The square is 3x3 in size, which satisfies the condition of having a side length of at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the output is correct.\n\n<<<[3, 6]>>>"
