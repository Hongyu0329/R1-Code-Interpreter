    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us in iterating over possible top-left corners of squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the potential square are the same.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the detected square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of size 3x3 or larger\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['C', 'L', 'F', 'T', 'H', 'P', 'R', 'T', 'F', 'U', 'W', 'B'],\n    ['R', 'A', 'Q', 'O', 'U', 'H', 'Z', 'I', 'H', 'S', 'E', 'D'],\n    ['K', 'A', 'Z', 'O', 'Z', 'Q', 'K', 'J', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'D'],\n    ['L', 'O', 'Q', 'X', 'M', 'J', 'S', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'G'],\n    ['R', 'C', 'U', 'J', 'A', 'I', 'D', 'Q', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'H'],\n    ['G', 'D', 'J', 'E', 'P', 'L', 'H', 'L', 'Q', 'O', 'C', 'U']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over the matrix, check for squares of the same character, and return the bottom-right corner of the first valid square it finds. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square in the matrix. The output `[4, 10]` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is located at row 4 and column 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 10]>>>"
