    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Validation**: For each potential square, validate that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Tracking the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form a square with (i, j) as the top-left corner\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['M', 'F', 'Q', 'G', 'Q', 'B', 'D', 'Z', 'X', 'D', 'N', 'J'],\n    ['W', 'W', 'I', 'D', 'M', 'O', 'B', 'U', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'Q'],\n    ['F', 'N', 'V', 'I', 'F', 'S', 'T', 'P', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'V'],\n    ['V', 'E', 'Y', 'B', 'Y', 'V', 'K', 'H', 'S', 'S', 'S', 'H'],\n    ['I', 'Q', 'D', 'W', 'Q', 'L', 'D', 'R', 'P', 'B', 'D', 'O'],\n    ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'D', 'E', 'G', 'O', 'N', 'I', 'D', 'D', 'R'],\n    ['R', 'Q', 'K', 'R', 'C', 'I', 'W', 'G', 'S', 'P', 'A', 'H']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution has provided the output `(3, 10)`, which indicates the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found in the matrix. \n\nGiven the problem statement and the matrix provided, this output represents the correct position of the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 10]>>>"
