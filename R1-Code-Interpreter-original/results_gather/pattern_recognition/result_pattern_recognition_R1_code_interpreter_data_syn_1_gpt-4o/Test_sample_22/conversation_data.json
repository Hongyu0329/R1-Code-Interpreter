    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over the matrix elements.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each element in the matrix, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3. This involves checking if the elements to the right and below are the same as the current element.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check for squares of increasing size until the elements do not match or the boundary of the matrix is reached.\n\n4. **Record the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for potential squares starting from (i, j)\n            current_char = matrix[i][j]\n            size = 1\n            while (i + size < rows) and (j + size < cols):\n                # Check if the square of size+1 is valid\n                valid_square = True\n                for k in range(size + 1):\n                    if matrix[i + size][j + k] != current_char or matrix[i + k][j + size] != current_char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if not valid_square:\n                    break\n                size += 1\n\n            # Update the largest square found\n            if size > max_size and size >= 3:\n                max_size = size\n                bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'X', 'I', 'R', 'T', 'M', 'J', 'C', 'W', 'A', 'Z'],\n    ['G', 'U', 'P', 'M', 'T', 'U', 'E', 'V', 'G', 'I', 'M'],\n    ['E', 'C', 'L', 'V', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'F', 'T', 'K', 'L'],\n    ['A', 'J', 'M', 'W', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'Q', 'T', 'O', 'P'],\n    ['C', 'E', 'U', 'X', 'J', 'J', 'J', 'X', 'A', 'U', 'G'],\n    ['O', 'L', 'H', 'F', 'F', 'O', 'Y', 'Y', 'Z', 'O', 'K'],\n    ['C', 'K', 'C', 'T', 'Z', 'G', 'E', 'G', 'M', 'L', 'D'],\n    ['P', 'G', 'H', 'Y', 'U', 'C', 'U', 'Y', 'S', 'E', 'Y'],\n    ['R', 'U', 'Z', 'H', 'R', 'C', 'E', 'Q', 'R', 'J', 'V'],\n    ['R', 'Q', 'Y', 'T', 'K', 'X', 'I', 'V', 'U', 'I', 'S'],\n    ['D', 'A', 'R', 'H', 'Q', 'N', 'H', 'A', 'B', 'I', 'Y'],\n    ['T', 'K', 'X', 'F', 'D', 'D', 'G', 'A', 'T', 'M', 'I']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3. The coordinates of this corner are (4, 6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 6]>>>"
