    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us iterate over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential square, verify that all characters on the boundary of the square are the same.\n\n4. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if the square of this size is valid\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                # Check the right and bottom boundaries of the square\n                for k in range(size):\n                    if matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] != char or matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] != char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    if size > max_size:\n                        max_size = size\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['Q', 'L', 'H', 'G', 'V', 'I', 'O', 'V', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'K', 'I'],\n    ['N', 'W', 'H', 'X', 'B', 'E', 'K', 'C', 'W', 'T', 'A', 'J', 'I', 'O', 'D'],\n    ['X', 'Q', 'B', 'V', 'S', 'X', 'X', 'I', 'D', 'I', 'Y', 'C', 'T', 'N', 'L'],\n    ['O', 'U', 'I', 'N', 'Y', 'W', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'P', 'Q', 'H'],\n    ['M', 'R', 'N', 'U', 'X', 'O', 'Y', 'U', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'J', 'J', 'Y', 'T'],\n    ['A', 'T', 'E', 'U', 'W', 'Y', 'K', 'Z', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'K', 'L', 'W', 'S']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The coordinates of this corner are (5, 10).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 10]>>>"
