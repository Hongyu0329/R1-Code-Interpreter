    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us in iterating through the matrix and checking for possible squares.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Matrix**: We will iterate through each element of the matrix and consider it as the top-left corner of a potential square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed. We will ensure that all elements in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all elements in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['L', 'W', 'F', 'E', 'O', 'J'],\n    ['V', 'J', 'W', 'O', 'V', 'E'],\n    ['F', 'Y', 'F', 'W', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['Z', 'Y', 'Z', 'U', 'Q', 'K'],\n    ['Y', 'Y', 'K', 'W', 'F', 'G'],\n    ['J', 'O', 'S', 'A', 'H', 'L'],\n    ['B', 'G', 'E', 'I', 'K', 'S'],\n    ['C', 'S', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'U'],\n    ['Y', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'N'],\n    ['U', 'Y', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'G']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The result is (9, 4), which means the bottom-right corner of the square is at row 9 and column 4.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[9, 4]>>>"
