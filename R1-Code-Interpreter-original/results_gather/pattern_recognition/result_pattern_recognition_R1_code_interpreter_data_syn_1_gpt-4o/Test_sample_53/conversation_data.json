    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix, which are 9 rows and 8 columns in this case.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters on the boundary of the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is found, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if the square of this size is valid\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                # Check the right and bottom boundaries of the square\n                for k in range(size):\n                    if matrix[i + k][j + size - 1] != char or matrix[i + size - 1][j + k] != char:\n                        valid_square = False\n                        break\n                if valid_square:\n                    if size > max_size:\n                        max_size = size\n                        bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n                else:\n                    break\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['O', 'P', 'R', 'F', 'A', 'L', 'M', 'G'],\n    ['C', 'Y', 'D', 'Z', 'F', 'V', 'G', 'V'],\n    ['Q', 'I', 'J', 'B', 'I', 'V', 'B', 'E'],\n    ['F', 'A', 'F', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'L'],\n    ['D', 'B', 'Z', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'P'],\n    ['Y', 'I', 'O', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'T'],\n    ['K', 'K', 'J', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'V', 'Q'],\n    ['C', 'V', 'O', 'F', 'E', 'Z', 'J', 'C'],\n    ['J', 'F', 'D', 'V', 'C', 'F', 'S', 'A']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 in the given matrix. The result is (6, 6), which means the bottom-right corner of the square is at row 6 and column 6.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<[6, 6]>>>"
