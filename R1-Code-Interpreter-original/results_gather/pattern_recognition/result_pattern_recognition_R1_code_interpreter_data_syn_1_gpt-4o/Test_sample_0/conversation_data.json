    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The task is to find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, ensure all characters are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we can stop once we find the first valid square.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['P', 'Y', 'L', 'I', 'G', 'H', 'C', 'G', 'I', 'W', 'C', 'C', 'Q'],\n    ['V', 'Y', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'K', 'Q', 'Q', 'O', 'Z', 'H'],\n    ['K', 'S', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'F', 'D', 'D', 'J', 'N', 'T'],\n    ['B', 'P', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'W', 'R', 'I', 'B', 'T', 'I'],\n    ['Y', 'L', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Y', 'U', 'Q', 'S', 'Z', 'V'],\n    ['D', 'F', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'Q', 'B', 'O', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'U'],\n    ['Y', 'N', 'F', 'U', 'P', 'B', 'J', 'M', 'Y', 'E', 'U', 'H', 'X'],\n    ['A', 'H', 'Z', 'O', 'C', 'B', 'I', 'I', 'D', 'D', 'W', 'X', 'F'],\n    ['D', 'E', 'A', 'F', 'G', 'W', 'W', 'K', 'J', 'E', 'A', 'T', 'U'],\n    ['R', 'Q', 'F', 'B', 'H', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'K', 'N', 'F', 'O', 'N']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of a square with a side length of at least 3 in the given character matrix. The output `[3, 4]` indicates the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square.\n\n<<<[3, 4]>>>"
