    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible top-left corners of squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For a given top-left corner and size, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest valid square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = None\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Try to form squares of increasing size starting from 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if the square of this size is valid\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['T', 'N', 'G', 'F', 'I', 'M', 'O'],\n    ['I', 'U', 'G', 'I', 'C', 'S', 'V'],\n    ['I', 'N', 'U', 'Z', 'R', 'Y', 'C'],\n    ['V', 'V', 'Y', 'A', 'G', 'O', 'R'],\n    ['Y', 'N', 'Z', 'Y', 'D', 'M', 'V'],\n    ['P', 'W', 'S', 'X', 'C', 'E', 'K'],\n    ['Q', 'B', 'W', 'P', 'O', 'A', 'D'],\n    ['N', 'Z', 'C', 'P', 'T', 'C', 'N'],\n    ['J', 'A', 'M', 'Z', 'H', 'E', 'J'],\n    ['S', 'Q', 'O', 'Z', 'B', 'P', 'B'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'U', 'C', 'C', 'O'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'J', 'U', 'R'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'L', 'R', 'H']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix. The output `(12, 2)` indicates that the largest square with sides of at least length 3, composed of the same character, has its bottom-right corner at row 12 and column 2.\n\n<<<[12, 2]>>>"
