    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the dimensions of the matrix to understand the bounds for our search.\n2. **Square Detection**: Iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each position, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n3. **Validation**: For each potential square, ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['V', 'J', 'Q', 'W', 'S', 'X', 'C', 'B'],\n    ['T', 'X', 'R', 'K', 'K', 'Z', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['J', 'T', 'X', 'R', 'A', 'S', 'L', 'X'],\n    ['J', 'H', 'H', 'J', 'M', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['Q', 'T', 'I', 'F', 'H', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['A', 'K', 'T', 'X', 'R', 'P', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['P', 'N', 'J', 'N', 'T', 'G', 'K', 'O']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will find the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 composed of the same character. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character. The output `[5, 7]` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is located at row 5 and column 7 in the matrix.\n\n<<<[5, 7]>>>"
