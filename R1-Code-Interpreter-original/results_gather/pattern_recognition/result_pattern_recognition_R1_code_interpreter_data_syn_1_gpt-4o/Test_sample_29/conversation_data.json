    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help us understand the boundaries for searching squares.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each cell in the matrix to consider it as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n3. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares starting from size 3x3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if is_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['D', 'C', 'D', 'R', 'Q', 'P'],\n    ['I', 'V', 'B', 'P', 'O', 'E'],\n    ['U', 'K', 'X', 'E', 'P', 'P'],\n    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'N', 'U', 'N'],\n    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'M', 'B', 'P'],\n    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'E', 'N'],\n    ['Q', 'A', 'O', 'I', 'F', 'B'],\n    ['V', 'R', 'Q', 'G', 'L', 'V'],\n    ['W', 'H', 'C', 'O', 'N', 'E'],\n    ['K', 'L', 'Y', 'M', 'V', 'Z'],\n    ['G', 'R', 'M', 'U', 'A', 'G']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and print the coordinates of its bottom-right corner. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the matrix. The output `(5, 2)` indicates that the largest square with sides of at least length 3, composed of the same character, has its bottom-right corner at row 5 and column 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 2]>>>"
