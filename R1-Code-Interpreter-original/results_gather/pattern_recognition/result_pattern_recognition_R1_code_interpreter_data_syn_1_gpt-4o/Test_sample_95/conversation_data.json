    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. This will help in iterating over possible starting points for squares.\n\n2. **Square Detection**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n4. **Output**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the position of the bottom-right corner of the square once found.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Start checking for squares of size 3x3 and larger\n    for size in range(3, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n        for i in range(rows - size + 1):\n            for j in range(cols - size + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                is_square = True\n                for x in range(size):\n                    for y in range(size):\n                        if matrix[i + x][j + y] != char:\n                            is_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not is_square:\n                        break\n                if is_square:\n                    # Return the bottom-right corner of the square\n                    return [i + size - 1, j + size - 1]\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    ['U', 'Y', 'R', 'Z', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'E'],\n    ['H', 'S', 'Z', 'Z', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'C'],\n    ['H', 'H', 'O', 'Z', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'U'],\n    ['C', 'O', 'C', 'B', 'E', 'O', 'Q', 'D'],\n    ['S', 'W', 'F', 'W', 'N', 'R', 'R', 'G'],\n    ['Y', 'V', 'A', 'W', 'O', 'J', 'D', 'W'],\n    ['L', 'N', 'U', 'I', 'T', 'G', 'A', 'Z']\n]\n\n# Find and print the bottom-right corner of the square\nprint(find_square(matrix))\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over the matrix, checking for squares of increasing size, and return the position of the bottom-right corner of the first valid square it finds. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code has successfully identified the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character. The output `[2, 6]` indicates that the bottom-right corner of the square is located at row 2, column 6 in the matrix.\n\nLet's provide the final answer:\n\n<<<[2, 6]>>>"
