    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Determine the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: For each cell in the matrix, check if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n3. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential square, verify if all characters in the square are the same.\n4. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n5. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_square(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    max_size = 0\n    bottom_right_corner = (-1, -1)\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check for squares of increasing size starting from 3\n            for size in range(3, min(rows - i, cols - j) + 1):\n                # Check if all characters in the square are the same\n                char = matrix[i][j]\n                valid_square = True\n                for x in range(i, i + size):\n                    for y in range(j, j + size):\n                        if matrix[x][y] != char:\n                            valid_square = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid_square:\n                        break\n                \n                if valid_square and size > max_size:\n                    max_size = size\n                    bottom_right_corner = (i + size - 1, j + size - 1)\n\n    return bottom_right_corner\n\nmatrix = [\n    ['K', 'R', 'J', 'Z', 'M', 'P', 'Y', 'Y', 'Z', 'F', 'Y', 'W', 'Z', 'R', 'Y'],\n    ['G', 'W', 'U', 'X', 'R', 'L', 'C', 'E', 'S', 'A', 'I', 'P', 'Q', 'I', 'I'],\n    ['M', 'Q', 'J', 'C', 'Y', 'V', 'P', 'A', 'Y', 'R', 'F', 'E', 'S', 'T', 'N'],\n    ['O', 'Y', 'D', 'A', 'B', 'O', 'B', 'E', 'B', 'A', 'X', 'W', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y'],\n    ['K', 'N', 'N', 'M', 'Z', 'Q', 'F', 'X', 'F', 'E', 'D', 'F', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y'],\n    ['A', 'N', 'K', 'Y', 'E', 'A', 'L', 'N', 'R', 'D', 'F', 'R', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y'],\n    ['W', 'Z', 'P', 'W', 'P', 'C', 'C', 'X', 'C', 'F', 'S', 'T', 'X', 'Y', 'M'],\n    ['N', 'B', 'M', 'E', 'A', 'M', 'D', 'E', 'K', 'H', 'K', 'V', 'V', 'C', 'J'],\n    ['G', 'J', 'I', 'W', 'I', 'N', 'T', 'Q', 'O', 'H', 'C', 'F', 'M', 'B', 'S']\n]\n\nresult = find_largest_square(matrix)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find the largest square in the matrix and return the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.
