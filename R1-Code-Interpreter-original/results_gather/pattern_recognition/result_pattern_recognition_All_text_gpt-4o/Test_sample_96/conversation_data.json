    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The matrix has 7 rows and 11 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**:\n   - A square of side length 3 or more must have the same character on all its sides.\n   - We need to check for squares starting from each position in the matrix and see if a square can be formed with the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Starting Points**:\n   - We will iterate over each cell in the matrix as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n   - For each cell, we will try to form squares of increasing size starting from 3x3.\n\n4. **Check for Square Formation**:\n   - For a square of size `n x n` starting at position `(i, j)`, we need to ensure:\n     - All characters in the row from `(i, j)` to `(i, j+n-1)` are the same.\n     - All characters in the column from `(i, j)` to `(i+n-1, j)` are the same.\n     - All characters in the row from `(i+n-1, j)` to `(i+n-1, j+n-1)` are the same.\n     - All characters in the column from `(i, j+n-1)` to `(i+n-1, j+n-1)` are the same.\n\n5. **Find the Largest Square**:\n   - We need to find the largest square that satisfies the above conditions and has a side length of at least 3.\n   - The bottom-right corner of this square will be `(i+n-1, j+n-1)`.\n\n6. **Iterate and Check**:\n   - Start from each cell `(i, j)` and try to form squares of increasing size.\n   - If a square is found, record its bottom-right corner.\n   - Continue until the largest possible square is found.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Once the largest square is identified, output the bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from `(2, 0)` with character 'B'.\n- Check for a 3x3 square:\n  - Rows: `(2, 0)` to `(2, 2)`, `(4, 0)` to `(4, 2)` are all 'B'.\n  - Columns: `(2, 0)` to `(4, 0)`, `(2, 2)` to `(4, 2)` are all 'B'.\n- A 3x3 square is found with bottom-right corner `(4, 2)`.\n\n- Check for a 4x4 square:\n  - Rows: `(2, 0)` to `(2, 3)`, `(5, 0)` to `(5, 3)` are not all 'B'.\n  - Columns: `(2, 0)` to `(5, 0)`, `(2, 3)` to `(5, 3)` are not all 'B'.\n- A 4x4 square is not possible.\n\nThus, the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is a 3x3 square with the bottom-right corner at `(4, 2)`.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[4, 2]>>>"
