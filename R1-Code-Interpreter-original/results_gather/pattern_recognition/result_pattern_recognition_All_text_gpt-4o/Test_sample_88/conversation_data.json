    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix and check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, we need to check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check each 3x3 sub-matrix.\n- The first potential 3x3 square starts at (1, 1) and ends at (3, 3). Check if all characters are the same.\n- Continue this process for each possible starting point of a 3x3 square.\n- When we reach the sub-matrix starting at (1, 1), we find that the characters are all 'S':\n  ```\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  ```\n  This forms a 3x3 square with the same character 'S'.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (3, 3).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, this is the only square of at least 3x3 size with uniform characters.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[3, 3]>>>"
