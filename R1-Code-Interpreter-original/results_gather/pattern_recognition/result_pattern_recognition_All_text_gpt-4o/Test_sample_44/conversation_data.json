    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix has 6 rows and 14 columns.\n\n2. **Identifying Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 3 and column 11, because the square needs space to extend 2 more rows and columns.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, note the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (1, 3), we find a 3x3 square of 'Z':\n  ```\n  Z Z Z\n  Z Z Z\n  Z Z Z\n  ```\n  This square extends from (1, 3) to (3, 5).\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (3, 5).\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, this is the only square of size 3x3 or larger in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[3, 5]>>>"
