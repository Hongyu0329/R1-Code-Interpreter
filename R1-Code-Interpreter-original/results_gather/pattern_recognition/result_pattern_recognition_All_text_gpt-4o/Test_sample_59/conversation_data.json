    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The matrix has 12 rows and 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger sub-matrix where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a 3x3 square can fit. This means iterating from row 0 to row 9 and column 0 to column 12, as starting from row 10 or column 13 would not allow a 3x3 square to fit.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all elements in the 3x3 sub-matrix are the same.\n\n5. **Expand the Square**: If a 3x3 square is found, attempt to expand it to a larger square by checking if the next row and column also contain the same character.\n\n6. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem states that the answer is unique, so there should be only one largest square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (3, 8), we find a 3x3 square of 'K's.\n- Expand this square: it can be expanded to a 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, and finally a 7x7 square of 'K's.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 7x7 square is at position (9, 14).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 9, column 14.\n\nThe answer is <<<[9, 14]>>>."
