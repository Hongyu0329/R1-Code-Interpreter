    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 13 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2) if the top-left corner is at (i, j).\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For a square to be valid, all characters in the square must be the same. This means checking all characters from (i, j) to (i+2, j+2) for a 3x3 square, and similarly for larger squares.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We need to iterate over each possible top-left corner (i, j) where i ranges from 0 to 9 (since 9+2=11, the last row index) and j ranges from 0 to 10 (since 10+2=12, the last column index).\n\n5. **Check for Larger Squares**: If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) by checking additional rows and columns.\n\n6. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\n7. **Find the Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so there should be only one valid square of the largest size.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (2, 7), we find a 3x3 square of 'V's:\n  ```\n  V V V\n  V V V\n  V V V\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (4, 9).\n- Check if this can be extended to a larger square. It cannot be extended to a 4x4 square because the next row and column do not have 'V's.\n- Continue checking the rest of the matrix, but no larger square is found.\n\nThus, the unique solution is the bottom-right corner of the 3x3 square found at (4, 9).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 9]>>>"
