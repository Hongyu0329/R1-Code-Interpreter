    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to find squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for 3x3, 4x4, etc., up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner of a potential square can be at any position (i, j) where:\n   - `i` ranges from 0 to 6 (since a 3x3 square starting at row 6 will end at row 8, the last row).\n   - `j` ranges from 0 to 9 (since a 3x3 square starting at column 9 will end at column 11, the last column).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if the characters in the square are the same. Start with a 3x3 square and increase the size if possible.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a square of uniform characters is found, record the bottom-right corner. The bottom-right corner of a square starting at (i, j) with side length `n` is at (i+n-1, j+n-1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, there is only one largest square. We need to ensure we find the largest possible square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- At position (2, 3), we find a 3x3 square of 'N's:\n  ```\n  N N N\n  N N N\n  N N N\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (4, 5).\n\n- Check if this square can be extended to a larger size. In this case, it cannot be extended to a 4x4 square because the next row and column do not have 'N's.\n\n- Continue checking other positions, but no larger square of uniform characters is found.\n\nThus, the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is the 3x3 square of 'N's starting at (2, 3) and ending at (4, 5).\n\nThe bottom-right corner of this square is at row 4, column 5.\n\nThe answer is <<<[4, 5]>>>."
