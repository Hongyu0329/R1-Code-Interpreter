    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7\nU  Y  R  Z  D  D  D  E  0\nH  S  Z  Z  D  D  D  C  1\nH  H  O  Z  D  D  D  U  2\nC  O  C  B  E  O  Q  D  3\nS  W  F  W  N  R  R  G  4\nY  V  A  W  O  J  D  W  5\nL  N  U  I  T  G  A  Z  6\n```\n\nWe need to check for squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3. Let's go through the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Identify potential squares**: We need to look for a 3x3 or larger square of the same character. We will start from the top-left and move to the bottom-right, checking each possible 3x3 square.\n\n2. **Check each 3x3 square**:\n   - Start from (0,0) and check if a 3x3 square can be formed.\n   - Move to (0,1), (0,2), etc., and repeat the process for each starting point until the end of the matrix.\n\n3. **Find the square of the same character**:\n   - At position (0,4), we have:\n     ```\n     D D D\n     D D D\n     D D D\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 square of 'D' characters.\n\n4. **Determine the bottom-right corner**:\n   - The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (2,6).\n\n5. **Verify uniqueness**:\n   - Check the rest of the matrix to ensure there are no other 3x3 or larger squares of the same character.\n   - No other such squares are found in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the unique square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (2,6).\n\nThe answer is <<<[2, 6]>>>."
