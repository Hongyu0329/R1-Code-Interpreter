    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 11 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning they are 3x3 or larger.\n\n3. **Character Consistency**: Each square must be composed of the same character.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix where a 3x3 square can fit. This means iterating over rows 0 to 8 and columns 0 to 3, as these are the last positions where a 3x3 square can start.\n\n5. **Check for Squares**: For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking the character at the starting point and ensuring all characters in the 3x3 (or larger) area are the same.\n\n6. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, note the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\n7. **Unique Solution**: The problem states the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left of the matrix.\n- At position (3, 0), we have the character 'R'.\n- Check the 3x3 area starting at (3, 0):\n  - (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)\n  - (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)\n  - (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)\n- All these positions contain the character 'R', forming a 3x3 square.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (5, 2).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, this is the only square of at least 3x3 size composed of the same character.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[5, 2]>>>"
