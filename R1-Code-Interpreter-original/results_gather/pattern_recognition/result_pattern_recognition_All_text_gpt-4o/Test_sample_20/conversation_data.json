    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 13 rows by 13 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, ..., up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Character Consistency**: Each square must be composed of the same character.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**:\n   - Start from each position in the matrix and attempt to form squares of increasing size.\n   - For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Check for 3x3 Squares**:\n   - Begin checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square can be formed with the same character.\n   - If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.).\n\n6. **Identify the Largest Square**:\n   - Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n   - Since the problem states the answer is unique, there should be only one largest square.\n\n7. **Output the Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner.\n- At position (9, 2), we find a 3x3 square of 'L's:\n  ```\n  L L L\n  L L L\n  L L L\n  ```\n- Check if it can be extended to a 4x4 square, but it cannot because the next row does not have 'L's.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (11, 4).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, this is the only square of at least 3x3 size in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[11, 4]>>>"
