    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We need to check each possible top-left corner of a square that could fit within the matrix. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 6 and column 3, because the square needs to fit within the 9x6 matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- At position (1, 3), we have the character 'W'. Check the 3x3 square starting at this position:\n  ```\n  W W W\n  W W W\n  W W W\n  ```\n  This is a valid 3x3 square composed entirely of 'W'.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (3, 5).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting from the same top-left corner (1, 3). A 4x4 square would extend beyond the matrix boundaries, so the largest possible square here is 3x3.\n\n- No other starting positions in the matrix can form a 3x3 square of the same character, as verified by checking other potential top-left corners.\n\nThus, the only valid square with a side length of at least 3 is the one identified, and its bottom-right corner is at position (3, 5).\n\nThe answer is <<<[3, 5]>>>."
