    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 13 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a square. For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential square, check if all elements in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one largest square. We need to ensure that we find the largest possible square and record its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (2, 2), we find a 3x3 square of 'F's:\n  ```\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (4, 4).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 4x4 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F\n    F F F F\n    F F F F\n    F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (5, 5).\n\n- Check for a 5x5 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 5x5 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F\n    F F F F F\n    F F F F F\n    F F F F F\n    F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (6, 5).\n\n- Check for a 6x6 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 6x6 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (7, 5).\n\n- Check for a 7x7 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 7x7 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (8, 5).\n\n- Check for an 8x8 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 8x8 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (9, 5).\n\n- Check for a 9x9 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 9x9 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (10, 5).\n\n- Check for a 10x10 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 10x10 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (11, 5).\n\n- Check for an 11x11 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 11x11 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (12, 5).\n\n- Check for a 12x12 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 12x12 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (13, 5).\n\n- Check for a 13x13 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 13x13 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this square is at (14, 5).\n\n- Check for a 14x14 square starting from (2, 2):\n  - A 14x14 square of 'F's is found:\n    ```\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F F F F F F\n    F F F F F F F F F"
