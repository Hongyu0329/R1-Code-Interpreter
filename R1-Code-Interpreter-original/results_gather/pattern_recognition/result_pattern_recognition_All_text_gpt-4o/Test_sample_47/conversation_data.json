    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10x10, meaning it has 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3. This means we will check for squares starting from each position in the matrix and see if a square of the same character can be formed.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i and j are such that a 3x3 square can fit within the matrix. This means i and j can range from 0 to 7 (since 10 - 3 = 7).\n\n4. **Check for Squares**: For each top-left corner (i, j), we will check if a 3x3 square can be formed with the same character. This involves checking the characters at positions:\n   - (i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)\n   - (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2)\n   - (i+2, j), (i+2, j+1), (i+2, j+2)\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a 3x3 square is found, the bottom-right corner of this square will be at position (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, meaning there is only one such square in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner (0, 0) and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- Continue this process until we find a square where all characters are the same.\n\nUpon checking the matrix, we find that:\n\n- Starting at position (5, 0), the characters are:\n  - (5, 0) = K, (5, 1) = K, (5, 2) = K\n  - (6, 0) = K, (6, 1) = K, (6, 2) = K\n  - (7, 0) = K, (7, 1) = K, (7, 2) = K\n\nAll these characters are 'K', forming a 3x3 square.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (7, 2).\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[7, 2]>>>"
