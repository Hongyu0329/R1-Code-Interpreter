    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\n0  V J Q W S X C B\n1  T X R K K Z N E\n2  J T X R A S L X\n3  J H H J M P P P\n4  Q T I F H P P P\n5  A K T X R P P P\n6  P N J N T G K O\n```\n\nWe will look for squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify potential squares**: We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix to see if it can be the top-left corner of a square of side length 3 or more.\n\n2. **Check for uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Record the bottom-right corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's go through the matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right and down, checking for squares.\n- A square of side length 3 starting at (3, 3) with character 'P' is found:\n  ```\n  P P P\n  P P P\n  P P P\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (5, 5).\n\n- Check if there are larger squares. In this case, there are no larger squares of the same character.\n\nThus, the only square with a side length of at least 3 is the one with the bottom-right corner at (5, 5).\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 5]>>>"
