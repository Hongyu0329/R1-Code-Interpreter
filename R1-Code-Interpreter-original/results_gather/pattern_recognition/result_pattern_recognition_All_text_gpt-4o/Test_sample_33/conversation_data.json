    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix has 11 rows and 14 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning each side of the square must be at least 3 characters long and composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, we need to ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, we note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- Continue checking larger squares until the maximum possible size is reached or a valid square is found.\n- Ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at position (2, 9), we have a 3x3 square of 'T's:\n  ```\n  T T T\n  T T T\n  T T T\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (4, 11).\n\n- We can extend this square to a 4x4 square of 'T's:\n  ```\n  T T T T\n  T T T T\n  T T T T\n  T T T T\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at position (5, 12).\n\n- We can further extend this to a 5x5 square of 'T's:\n  ```\n  T T T T T\n  T T T T T\n  T T T T T\n  T T T T T\n  T T T T T\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 5x5 square is at position (6, 13).\n\nThis is the largest square of 'T's that can be formed in the matrix, and it satisfies the condition of having a side length of at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square is:\n\n<<<[6, 13]>>>"
