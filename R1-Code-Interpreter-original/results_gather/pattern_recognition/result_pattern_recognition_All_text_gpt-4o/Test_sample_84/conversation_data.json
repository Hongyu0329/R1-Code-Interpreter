    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 10 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner of a square of size `n` can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 12 - n` and `j <= 10 - n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner `(i, j)`, check if the characters in the square of size `n` are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns from `(i, j)` to `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n5. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner. The bottom-right corner of a square with top-left corner `(i, j)` and size `n` is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once all possible squares have been checked, output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with squares of size 3x3 and check each possible top-left corner.\n- Increase the size of the square and repeat the process until no larger square can be found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find that the largest square composed of the same character is a 7x7 square of 'F's. The top-left corner of this square is at `(2, 4)`, and the bottom-right corner is at `(8, 10)`.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 8, column 9 (since the column index starts from 0).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 9]>>>"
