    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix has 6 rows and 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning the smallest square we are interested in is 3x3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at any position (i, j) where i <= 3 and j <= 9, because the square must fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) is composed of the same character. We will continue to check larger squares until we either find a square that is not uniform or we reach the maximum possible size.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform square is found, we record the position of its bottom-right corner. The bottom-right corner of a square with top-left corner (i, j) and side length `n` is at (i + n - 1, j + n - 1).\n\n6. **Identify the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we are looking for the largest square that meets the criteria. We will keep track of the largest square found.\n\nNow, let's apply this analysis to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner (0, 0) and check for squares of increasing size.\n- At position (0, 1), we find a 3x3 square of 'E's:\n  ```\n  E E E\n  E E E\n  E E E\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (2, 3).\n- Check for larger squares starting from (0, 1). We find a 4x4 square of 'E's:\n  ```\n  E E E E\n  E E E E\n  E E E E\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (2, 4).\n- Continue checking for larger squares. We find a 5x5 square of 'E's:\n  ```\n  E E E E E\n  E E E E E\n  E E E E E\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (2, 5).\n- No larger uniform square of 'E's can be formed starting from (0, 1) because the next row does not have 'E's.\n\nAfter checking all possible starting points, the largest square found is the 5x5 square of 'E's with the bottom-right corner at (2, 5).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 5]>>>"
