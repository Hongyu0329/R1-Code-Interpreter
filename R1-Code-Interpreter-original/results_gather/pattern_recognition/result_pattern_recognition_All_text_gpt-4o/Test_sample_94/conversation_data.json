    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\n0  1  2  3  4  5\nG  R  Z  K  I  V\nC  J  H  B  Y  K\nB  L  L  Q  U  X\nU  O  R  Q  T  R\nZ  E  L  O  O  O\nX  J  J  O  O  O\nC  Y  M  O  O  O\n```\n\nWe will check for squares of side length 3 or more, starting from each position in the matrix. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify potential starting points**: We need to check each position in the matrix as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n2. **Check for square formation**: For each potential starting point, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Record the bottom-right corner**: If a square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's go through the matrix:\n\n- Start from (0,0) and check for squares. No square of side length 3 can be formed here.\n- Move to (0,1), (0,2), etc., and repeat the process.\n- Continue this process for each row.\n\nUpon checking, we find that starting from (4,3), we can form a square of side length 3 with the character 'O':\n\n```\nO O O\nO O O\nO O O\n```\n\nThe bottom-right corner of this square is at position (6,5).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 5]>>>"
