    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is 6 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Criteria for a Square**: \n   - A square must have all sides of equal length.\n   - The length of each side must be at least 3.\n   - All characters in the square must be the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Square Sizes**: \n   - Start with the smallest possible square size, which is 3x3, and increase the size until the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n4. **Check for Squares**:\n   - For each potential top-left corner of a square, check if a square of the current size can be formed.\n   - Ensure all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Ensure Uniqueness**:\n   - The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one valid square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with a 3x3 square and check each possible top-left corner.\n- For each top-left corner, check if the 3x3 area contains the same character.\n- If a larger square is possible, check for larger squares until the maximum size is reached.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- Starting from the top-left corner, we find that the characters 'I' form a 4x4 square starting at position (2, 8) and ending at position (5, 11).\n- The characters in this square are all 'I', and the square is larger than 3x3, satisfying the problem's conditions.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of this square is at position (5, 11).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 11]>>>"
