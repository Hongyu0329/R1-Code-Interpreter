    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\n0: Q S I K M K S W\n1: I Q B C M P M P\n2: M Q W J O C C C\n3: R O B Q E C C C\n4: P D B A R C C C\n5: Q P C D O H J P\n```\n\nWe need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. The process involves:\n\n1. **Iterate through each possible top-left corner of a 3x3 square**: Start from each element in the matrix and check if a 3x3 square can be formed with that element as the top-left corner.\n\n2. **Check for uniformity**: For each potential 3x3 square, check if all elements in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Identify the bottom-right corner**: If a valid square is found, note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's go through the matrix:\n\n- Start from (0,0) to (3,3) as the top-left corner of a potential 3x3 square.\n- Check each 3x3 square for uniformity.\n\n**Checking each potential 3x3 square:**\n\n- **Square starting at (2, 5):**\n  ```\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  ```\n  - All elements are 'C', so this is a valid 3x3 square.\n  - The bottom-right corner of this square is at (4, 7).\n\nNo other 3x3 or larger uniform squares can be formed in this matrix, as other potential squares do not have uniform characters.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the unique square with a side length of at least 3 is at position:\n\n<<<[4, 7]>>>"
