    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix is 8 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, etc., up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each potential top-left corner of a square, check if a square of the same character can be formed. The top-left corner can be any cell in the matrix, but we must ensure that the entire square fits within the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, verify that all characters in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square's boundaries.\n\n5. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found. If multiple squares of the same size are found, any of them can be considered, but the problem states the answer is unique, implying there is only one largest square.\n\n6. **Output the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start by examining the matrix for squares of the same character.\n- Notice the block of 'M' characters starting at row 3, column 1:\n  ```\n  M M M M\n  M M M M\n  M M M M\n  M M M M\n  ```\n  This forms a 4x4 square of 'M' characters.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at row 6, column 4.\n\n- Check the rest of the matrix to ensure there are no larger squares. Given the matrix dimensions and the placement of other characters, no larger uniform square can be formed.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at row 6, column 4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 4]>>>"
