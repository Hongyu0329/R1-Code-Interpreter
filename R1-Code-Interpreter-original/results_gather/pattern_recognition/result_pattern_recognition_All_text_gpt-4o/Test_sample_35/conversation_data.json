    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 14 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is valid if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a square.\n   - For each starting point, check all possible square sizes (3x3, 4x4, etc.) that fit within the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Check Square Validity**:\n   - For a square starting at position (i, j) with size `n`, check if all characters in the sub-matrix from (i, j) to (i+n-1, j+n-1) are the same.\n   - If they are, record the bottom-right corner of this square, which is (i+n-1, j+n-1).\n\n5. **Find the Largest Square**:\n   - Keep track of the largest valid square found. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem states that the answer is unique, so we assume there is only one largest square.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner (0,0).\n- As we iterate, we find that the largest square composed of the same character is a 5x5 square of 'G' characters.\n- This square starts at (1, 3) and ends at (5, 7).\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 5, column 7.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 7]>>>"
