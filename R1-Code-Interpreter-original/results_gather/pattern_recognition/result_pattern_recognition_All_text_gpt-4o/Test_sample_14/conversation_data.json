    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 14 rows and 11 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of size `n`, the top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 14 - n` and `j <= 11 - n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner, which is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one largest square. We need to ensure that we find the largest possible square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` for squares of size 3x3 and larger.\n- As we iterate, we find that the largest square composed of the same character is a 6x6 square of 'D's.\n- The top-left corner of this square is at `(3, 5)`.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 6x6 square is at `(8, 10)`.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the largest square are:\n\n<<<[8, 10]>>>"
