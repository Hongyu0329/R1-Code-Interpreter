    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning each side of the square must be at least 3 characters long and composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, we need to ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, we record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For each starting point (i, j), check if the 3x3 square with top-left corner at (i, j) is uniform.\n- If a uniform 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) while maintaining uniformity.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest uniform square found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- The first 3x3 square of 'Y' characters starts at (3, 12) and ends at (5, 14).\n- This square can be extended to a 4x4 square starting at (3, 12) and ending at (6, 14).\n- The largest uniform square of 'Y' characters is a 4x4 square with the bottom-right corner at (6, 14).\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square is:\n\n<<<[6, 14]>>>"
