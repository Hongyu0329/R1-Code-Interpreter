    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\nP  S  K  Y  A  O  X  B  H  C  (0)\nT  Y  Z  V  T  M  K  X  A  T  (1)\nD  P  R  O  Z  K  K  K  Y  J  (2)\nR  X  K  W  M  K  K  K  N  G  (3)\nB  V  B  T  D  K  K  K  K  I  (4)\nB  M  I  D  X  M  P  E  A  K  (5)\n```\n\nWe will look for squares of the same character with a side length of at least 3. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify potential squares**: Start from each cell and check if it can be the top-left corner of a square of side length 3 or more.\n\n2. **Check for uniformity**: For each potential square, ensure all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Record the bottom-right corner**: If a valid square is found, note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's go through the matrix:\n\n- Start from (0,0) and move right and down, checking each possible top-left corner for a square.\n- At position (2,5), we have 'K'. Check if a 3x3 square can be formed:\n  - (2,5) to (2,7) are 'K'\n  - (3,5) to (3,7) are 'K'\n  - (4,5) to (4,7) are 'K'\n- This forms a 3x3 square with the same character 'K'.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (4,7).\n\nNo other 3x3 or larger squares of the same character can be found in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[4, 7]>>>"
