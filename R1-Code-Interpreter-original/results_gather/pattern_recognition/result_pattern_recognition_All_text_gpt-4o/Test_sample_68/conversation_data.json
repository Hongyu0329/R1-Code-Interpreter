    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The matrix has 8 rows and 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**:\n   - A square of side length 3 or more means we need to check for a 3x3 or larger sub-matrix where all elements are the same.\n   - We need to iterate over possible top-left corners of such squares and check if a square can be formed.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**:\n   - Start from each element in the matrix and attempt to form squares of increasing size.\n   - For a square of size `n`, check if all elements in the `n x n` sub-matrix are the same.\n\n4. **Check for Largest Square**:\n   - We need to find the largest possible square, as the problem states the answer is unique.\n   - Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Iterate and Check**:\n   - Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate through each element.\n   - For each element, attempt to form squares of increasing size until the matrix boundary is reached or a square cannot be formed.\n   - Check if all elements in the current square are the same.\n\n6. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - Once a valid square is found, record its bottom-right corner.\n   - If a larger square is found, update the recorded position.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - After iterating through the matrix, output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nNow, let's apply this logic to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left and check for squares.\n- At position (1, 7), we find a 3x3 square of 'F's:\n  ```\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (3, 9).\n- Check for larger squares, but no larger square of the same character is found.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (3, 9).\n\nThe answer is: <<<[3, 9]>>>"
