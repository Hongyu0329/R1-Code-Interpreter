    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 14 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is valid if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a square.\n   - For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Check Square Validity**:\n   - For a square starting at position (i, j) with size `n`, check if all characters in the sub-matrix from (i, j) to (i+n-1, j+n-1) are the same.\n   - Ensure that the square does not exceed the matrix boundaries.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner, which is (i+n-1, j+n-1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**:\n   - Since the problem states the answer is unique, there is only one largest square with a side length of at least 3.\n   - We need to find this square and output its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner.\n- Identify that there is a 7x7 square of 'D' starting at (6, 2) and ending at (12, 8).\n- This is the largest square with a side length of at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at position (12, 8).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[12, 8]>>>"
