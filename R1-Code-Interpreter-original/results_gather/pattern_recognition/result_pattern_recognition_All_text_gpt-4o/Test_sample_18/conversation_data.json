    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 15 rows by 10 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3. This means we need to check for uniformity of characters in submatrices of size 3x3 or larger.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at most at row 12 and column 7, because a 3x3 square needs space for 3 rows and 3 columns.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each top-left corner, check if the 3x3 submatrix (or larger) is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we are looking for the largest square. If multiple squares of the same size exist, the problem implies there is only one correct answer, so we assume the largest square is unique.\n\n7. **Output the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- For each position, check for a 3x3 square.\n- If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nAfter analyzing the matrix, the largest square of uniform characters is found to be composed of the character 'F' and is located at the bottom-right corner of the matrix. The square is 4x4 in size, starting from row 9, column 4 to row 12, column 7.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 12, column 7.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[12, 7]>>>"
