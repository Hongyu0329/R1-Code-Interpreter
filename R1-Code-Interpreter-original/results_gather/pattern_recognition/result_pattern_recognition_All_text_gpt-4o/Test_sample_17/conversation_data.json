    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix is 12 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 9 and column 4, because the square needs to fit within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one square of the largest size. We need to ensure we find the largest possible square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- The first 3x3 square starting at (6, 0) with character 'I' is valid:\n  ```\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (8, 2).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting from the same top-left corner. A 4x4 square is also valid:\n  ```\n  I I I I\n  I I I I\n  I I I I\n  I I I M\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at (9, 3).\n\n- No larger square can be formed starting from (6, 0) because the next row (10) does not have 'I' in the required positions.\n\n- Check other potential top-left corners, but no larger square than 4x4 is found.\n\nThus, the largest square found is 4x4 with the bottom-right corner at (9, 3).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 3]>>>"
