    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i and j are such that a square of side length 3 can fit within the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Check for Squares**: For each top-left corner (i, j), we will check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed:\n   - Check if the characters in the 3x3 sub-matrix starting at (i, j) are the same.\n   - If they are, check if a larger square can be formed by expanding the side length.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, calculate the bottom-right corner of the square. For a square starting at (i, j) with side length `l`, the bottom-right corner is at (i + l - 1, j + l - 1).\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- At position (2, 3), we find the character 'O'.\n- Check the 3x3 sub-matrix starting at (2, 3):\n  ```\n  O O O\n  O O O\n  O O O\n  ```\n  All characters are 'O', so this is a valid 3x3 square.\n- Check if we can expand this square:\n  - The 4x4 sub-matrix starting at (2, 3) is:\n    ```\n    O O O O\n    O O O O\n    O O O O\n    O O O O\n    ```\n    All characters are 'O', so this is a valid 4x4 square.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at (5, 6).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, this is the only square of side length at least 3 in the matrix.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 6]>>>"
