    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The matrix is 15 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a square.\n   - For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, meaning there is only one such square in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left and move right and down, checking for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (2, 0), we find a 3x3 square of 'G's:\n  ```\n  G G G\n  G G G\n  G G G\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (4, 2).\n\n- Check if this square can be extended:\n  - Extend to 4x4, 5x5, etc., as long as the characters remain the same.\n  - The square can be extended to a 6x6 square of 'G's:\n    ```\n    G G G G G G\n    G G G G G G\n    G G G G G G\n    G G G G G G\n    G G G G G G\n    G G G G G G\n    ```\n  - The bottom-right corner of this 6x6 square is at (7, 5).\n\n- Verify that no larger square exists:\n  - Check if a 7x7 square can be formed starting from (2, 0). It cannot, as the next row contains different characters.\n\nThus, the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is a 6x6 square of 'G's, and its bottom-right corner is at (7, 5).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 5]>>>"
