    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 10 rows and 11 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from each element in the matrix and attempt to form a square with that element as the top-left corner.\n   - For a square of size 3x3, check if all elements in the 3x3 sub-matrix are the same.\n   - If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) by checking the next row and column.\n\n4. **Check Boundaries**: Ensure that when checking for squares, we do not exceed the matrix boundaries. For a square of size `n`, the top-left corner must be at a position where both the row and column indices are less than or equal to `10 - n` and `11 - n`, respectively.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner. The bottom-right corner of a square with top-left corner at `(i, j)` and side length `n` is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one largest square with a side length of at least 3. We need to find this square and output its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position `(5, 3)`, we find a 3x3 square of 'J's:\n  ```\n  J J J\n  J J J\n  J J J\n  ```\n- This square can be extended to a 4x4 square:\n  ```\n  J J J J\n  J J J J\n  J J J J\n  J J J J\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at `(8, 6)`.\n\nThus, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square is:\n\n<<<[8, 6]>>>"
