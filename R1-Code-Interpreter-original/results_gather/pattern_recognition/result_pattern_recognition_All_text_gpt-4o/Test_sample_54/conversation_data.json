    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We need to check each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 6 and column 4, because the square needs to fit within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a 3x3 or larger square can be formed with the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, calculate the bottom-right corner's coordinates.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right and down, checking for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (5, 1), we find the character 'N'.\n- Check the 3x3 square starting at (5, 1):\n  - (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)\n  - (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)\n  - (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)\n- All these positions contain the character 'N', confirming a 3x3 square.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (7, 3).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, and we have found a valid 3x3 square, this must be the solution.\n\nThe bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[7, 3]>>>"
