    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 13 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: Start by iterating over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i and j are such that a square of the desired size can fit within the matrix bounds.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner. The bottom-right corner of a square with top-left corner (i, j) and side length `n` is at position (i+n-1, j+n-1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one square of the largest size. We need to ensure we find the largest possible square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left of the matrix.\n- For each position, check for squares of increasing size (3x3, 4x4, etc.) until the maximum possible size for that position.\n- The largest square found in the matrix is a 7x7 square of 'B' characters starting at (7, 1) and ending at (13, 7).\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at position (9, 7).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 7]>>>"
