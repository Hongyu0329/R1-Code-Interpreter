    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of increasing size starting from 3x3 up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Character Consistency**: For a square to be valid, all characters in the square must be the same.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**:\n   - Start with the smallest possible square size (3x3).\n   - For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of the current size can be formed.\n   - Ensure that the square fits within the matrix boundaries.\n\n5. **Check for Larger Squares**: If a valid square is found, check if it can be expanded to a larger square by increasing the size and verifying character consistency.\n\n6. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: For each valid square, record the position of the bottom-right corner.\n\n7. **Find the Largest Square**: Among all valid squares, identify the largest one. If there are multiple squares of the same size, any of them can be chosen since the problem states the answer is unique.\n\n8. **Output the Result**: Provide the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with a 3x3 square and check each possible position.\n- The first 3x3 square of 'E's is found starting at row 4, column 0.\n- This square can be expanded to a 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, and finally an 8x8 square of 'E's.\n- The 8x8 square starts at row 4, column 0 and ends at row 11, column 7.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 11, column 7.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[11, 7]>>>"
