    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 7 rows and 13 columns.\n\n2. **Minimum Square Size**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3. This means we need to check for 3x3 squares, 4x4 squares, and so on, up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. The top-left corner of a potential square can be at any position (i, j) where i and j are such that a square of the desired size can fit within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square boundaries.\n\n5. **Identify Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, calculate the position of its bottom-right corner. For a square with top-left corner at (i, j) and side length `n`, the bottom-right corner will be at (i + n - 1, j + n - 1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one largest square. We need to ensure that we find the largest possible square and not just any square of size 3x3.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start by checking for 3x3 squares. We find that there is a 3x3 square of 'O's starting at (4, 2) and ending at (6, 4).\n- Check for larger squares. We find that this 3x3 square can be extended to a 4x4 square of 'O's starting at (4, 2) and ending at (7, 5).\n- Check for even larger squares. We find that this 4x4 square can be extended to a 5x5 square of 'O's starting at (4, 2) and ending at (8, 6).\n\nSince the matrix has only 7 rows, the largest possible square that can fit is a 5x5 square. Therefore, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at (6, 4).\n\nThe final answer, representing the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the largest square, is:\n\n<<<[6, 4]>>>"
