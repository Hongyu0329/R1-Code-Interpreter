    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 15 rows and 13 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a square.\n   - For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Check Square Validity**:\n   - For a square starting at position (i, j) with size `n`, ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n   - Specifically, check the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column of the square.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner, which is (i+n-1, j+n-1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**:\n   - Continue this process for all possible starting points and sizes.\n   - The problem states that the answer is unique, so there should be only one largest square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nBy applying these steps to the given matrix, we find that the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is composed of the character 'M' and is located at the bottom-right corner of the matrix. The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (14, 12).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[14, 12]>>>"
