    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The matrix is 15 rows by 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of at least 3x3 can fit. This means iterating from row 0 to row 12 and column 0 to column 12, as starting from row 13 or column 13 would not allow for a 3x3 square.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all elements in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner. The bottom-right corner of a square starting at (i, j) with side length `n` is at (i+n-1, j+n-1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, there is only one largest square. We need to ensure we find the largest possible square and record its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check for 3x3 squares.\n- As we iterate, we find a 6x6 square of 'G' starting at (7, 5) and ending at (12, 10).\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (12, 10).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at row 12, column 10.\n\nThe answer is <<<[12, 10]>>>."
