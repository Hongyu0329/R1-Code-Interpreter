    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The matrix is 13 rows by 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, and larger squares.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: Start by iterating over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of size `n`, the top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 13 - n` and `j <= 15 - n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner `(i, j)`, check if the sub-matrix of size `n x n` starting at `(i, j)` is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Track the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem states that the answer is unique, so there should be only one largest square.\n\n6. **Determine Bottom-Right Corner**: Once the largest square is identified, calculate the bottom-right corner. For a square starting at `(i, j)` with size `n`, the bottom-right corner is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the smallest possible square size of 3x3 and increase the size until no larger square can be found.\n- Check each possible starting point `(i, j)` for a square of the current size.\n- For each starting point, verify if all characters in the `n x n` sub-matrix are the same.\n- The largest square found in the matrix is a 4x4 square of 'X' characters starting at `(5, 5)`.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is `(8, 8)`.\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square is:\n\n<<<[8, 8]>>>"
