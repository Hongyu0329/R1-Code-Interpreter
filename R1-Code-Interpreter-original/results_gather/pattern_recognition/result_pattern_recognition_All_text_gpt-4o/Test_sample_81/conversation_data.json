    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix has 6 rows and 16 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning each side of the square must be composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size, starting from 3x3.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, we need to ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, we note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left and move right and down, checking for 3x3 squares.\n- For each 3x3 square, check if all characters are the same.\n- If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- The first 3x3 square of identical characters is found starting at position (3, 7) with the character 'I'.\n- The square extends to (5, 9), making the bottom-right corner of this square at position (5, 9).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 is at row 5, column 9.\n\nThe answer is <<<[5, 9]>>>."
