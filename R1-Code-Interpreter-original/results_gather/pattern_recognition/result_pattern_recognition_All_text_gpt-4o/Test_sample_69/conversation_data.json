    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning they are 3x3 or larger, and all elements in the square are the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 5 and column 4, because the square needs to fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, calculate the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- At position (0, 4), we have a 3x3 square of 'F':\n  ```\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  ```\n  This square is uniform and meets the size requirement.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (2, 6).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, this is the only square that meets the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[2, 6]>>>"
