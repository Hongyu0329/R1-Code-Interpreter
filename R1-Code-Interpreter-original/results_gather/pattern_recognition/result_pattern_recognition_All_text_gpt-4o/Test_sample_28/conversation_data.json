    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 14 rows and 11 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its top-left corner at position (i, j) and its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2).\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner (i, j) of a square. The maximum value for i is 11 (14 - 3) and for j is 8 (11 - 3) to ensure the square fits within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each top-left corner, check if the 3x3 or larger square is composed of the same character. This involves checking all characters in the square to see if they are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For each square, verify if all characters are the same.\n- Once a valid square is found, note the bottom-right corner.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at position (2, 1), we have a 3x3 square of 'F's:\n  ```\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (4, 3).\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[4, 3]>>>"
