    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, where all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i <= 9 and j <= 3, because the square must fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n4. **Check for Uniform Squares**: For each top-left corner (i, j), we will check if a 3x3 square (or larger) starting at that position is composed of the same character. We will check squares of increasing size until we either find a valid square or reach the matrix boundary.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square. The bottom-right corner of a square with top-left corner (i, j) and side length `n` is at (i + n - 1, j + n - 1).\n\n6. **Identify the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we are looking for the largest such square. If multiple squares are found, the largest one will have the largest bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner (0, 0) and check for squares.\n- Continue this process for each possible top-left corner.\n- When checking from (5, 2), we find a 3x3 square of 'W' characters:\n  ```\n  W W W\n  W W W\n  W W W\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (7, 4).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting from (5, 2). We find a 4x4 square of 'W' characters:\n  ```\n  W W W W\n  W W W W\n  W W W W\n  W W W W\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (8, 5).\n\n- No larger square can be formed starting from (5, 2) or any other position.\n\nThus, the largest square found is a 4x4 square of 'W' characters, and its bottom-right corner is at (8, 5).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 5]>>>"
