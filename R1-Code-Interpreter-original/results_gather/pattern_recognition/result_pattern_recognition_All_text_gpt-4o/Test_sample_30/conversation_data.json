    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 11 rows and 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its bottom-right corner at position (i, j) if:\n   - The characters at positions (i, j), (i-1, j), (i-2, j), (i, j-1), (i, j-2), (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j-2), (i-2, j-1), and (i-2, j-2) are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Bottom-Right Corners**: Start from the third row and third column (index 2, 2) and iterate to the last row and column, checking for the condition mentioned above.\n\n4. **Check for Larger Squares**: If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square by checking additional rows and columns.\n\n5. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we only need to find one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from position (2, 2) to (10, 5).\n- At position (5, 5), we find the following 3x3 square of 'E':\n\n  ```\n  E E E\n  E E E\n  E E E\n  ```\n\n  This square is located with its bottom-right corner at (5, 5).\n\n- Check if this can be extended to a larger square. In this case, it cannot be extended further as the matrix boundary is reached.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (5, 5).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 5]>>>"
