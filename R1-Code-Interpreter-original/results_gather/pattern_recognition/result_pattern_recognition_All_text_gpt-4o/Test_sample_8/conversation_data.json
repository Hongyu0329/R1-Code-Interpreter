    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with sides of at least length 3, meaning the smallest square we are interested in is 3x3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 7 and column 3, because a 3x3 square starting at row 8 or column 4 would exceed the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Largest Square**: We will keep track of the largest square found that meets the criteria.\n\n6. **Determine the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once the largest square is identified, we will determine the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- For each 3x3 square, check if all characters are the same.\n- If a 3x3 square is found, attempt to expand it to 4x4, 5x5, etc., as long as the characters remain the same and the square fits within the matrix boundaries.\n- Keep track of the largest square found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- The character 'B' forms a 3x3 square starting at row 5, column 2.\n- The square extends to a 4x4 square with the same character 'B', covering rows 5 to 8 and columns 2 to 5.\n\nThe bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at row 8, column 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 5]>>>"
