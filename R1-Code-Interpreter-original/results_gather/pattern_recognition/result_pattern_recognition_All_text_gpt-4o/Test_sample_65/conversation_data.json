    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix has 6 rows and 14 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from each element in the matrix and check if it can be the top-left corner of a square.\n   - For a square of size 3x3, the top-left corner can be at most at row 3 and column 11, because the square needs space to extend 2 more rows and columns.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if all elements in the 3x3 (or larger) region are the same.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (0, 2), we have the character 'I'. Check the 3x3 region starting from here:\n  ```\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  ```\n  All elements are 'I', so this is a valid 3x3 square.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (2, 4).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting from (0, 2). A 4x4 square would require checking one more row and column:\n  ```\n  I I I M\n  I I I Z\n  I I I J\n  ```\n  The fourth column and row introduce different characters ('M', 'Z', 'J'), so a larger square is not possible.\n\n- Since the problem states the answer is unique, and we have found a valid 3x3 square, this must be the solution.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[2, 4]>>>"
