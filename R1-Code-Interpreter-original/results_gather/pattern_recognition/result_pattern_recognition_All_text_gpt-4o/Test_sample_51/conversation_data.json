    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix has 7 rows and 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3 size. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, ..., up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of size `n`, the top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 7-n` and `j <= 12-n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner `(i, j)`, we will check if all characters in the `n x n` square starting from `(i, j)` are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform square is found, record the bottom-right corner, which is `(i+n-1, j+n-1)`.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we are looking for the largest such square. We will start checking from the largest possible size down to 3x3 to ensure we find the largest square first.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the largest possible square size that fits within the matrix dimensions, which is 7x7.\n- Check for uniformity of characters in each potential square.\n- If no 7x7 square is found, reduce the size and repeat until a square is found.\n\nUpon checking the matrix, we find:\n\n- A 3x3 square of 'A' starting at `(1, 3)` and ending at `(3, 5)`.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at row 3, column 5.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[3, 5]>>>."
