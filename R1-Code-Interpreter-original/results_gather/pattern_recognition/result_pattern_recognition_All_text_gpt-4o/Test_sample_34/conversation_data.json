    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 7 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its top-left corner at position (i, j) and its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2).\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner (i, j), check if all characters in the 3x3 sub-matrix are the same.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: \n   - The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 4 and column 5, because the bottom-right corner must fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n5. **Examine Each 3x3 Sub-Matrix**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner (0, 0) and move to (4, 5).\n   - For each position, check if the 3x3 sub-matrix has all identical characters.\n\n6. **Find the Unique Square**:\n   - As we iterate, we find that the sub-matrix starting at (1, 0) and ending at (3, 2) is composed entirely of the character 'T'.\n   - This sub-matrix is:\n     ```\n     T T T\n     T T T\n     T T T\n     ```\n   - The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (3, 2).\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we have found the only 3x3 square that satisfies the conditions.\n\nThe bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[3, 2]>>>"
