    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 14 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of size 3x3, the top-left corner can be at most at row 11 and column 6 (since 11+2=13 and 6+2=8, which are within the matrix bounds).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed by verifying if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, there should be only one largest square. We need to ensure we find the largest possible square and its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- For each position, check for squares of increasing size (3x3, 4x4, etc.) until the matrix bounds are exceeded.\n- Verify if all characters in the square are the same.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nUpon analyzing the matrix, we find:\n\n- A 3x3 square of 'N' characters starting at row 7, column 3 and ending at row 9, column 5.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at row 9, column 5.\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square is:\n\n<<<[9, 5]>>>"
