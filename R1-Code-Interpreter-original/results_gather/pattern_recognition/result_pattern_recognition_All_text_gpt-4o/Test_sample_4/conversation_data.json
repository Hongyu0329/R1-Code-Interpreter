    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 7 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for 3x3, 4x4, etc., up to the maximum possible square that can fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each potential top-left corner of a square, check if a square of the same character can be formed.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, ensure all characters within the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Ensure Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one valid square of the required size.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check for 3x3 squares.\n- The first 3x3 square starting at (0, 0) is:\n  ```\n  X R C\n  D L W\n  Y D R\n  ```\n  This is not uniform.\n\n- Move to the next possible 3x3 square starting at (0, 1):\n  ```\n  R C H\n  L W I\n  D R J\n  ```\n  This is not uniform.\n\n- Continue this process until you find a uniform 3x3 square.\n\n- At position (0, 6), the 3x3 square is:\n  ```\n  Y Y Y\n  Y Y Y\n  Y Y Y\n  ```\n  This is a uniform square of 'Y'.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (2, 8).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting from (0, 6), but since the problem states the answer is unique, and we have found a valid 3x3 square, we can conclude this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[2, 8]>>>"
