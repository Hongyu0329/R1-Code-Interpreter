    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 15 rows by 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning the smallest square we are interested in is 3x3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of at least 3x3 can fit. This means iterating over each cell in the matrix that could be the top-left corner of a 3x3 square.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify the Largest Square**: As we find squares, we need to keep track of the largest one found. Since the problem states the answer is unique, there should be only one largest square.\n\n6. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: For the largest square found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For each 3x3 square, check if it can be expanded to a larger square with the same character.\n- Continue this process until the largest possible square is found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at position (0, 3), we have a 3x3 square of 'H's.\n- This square can be expanded to a 4x4 square of 'H's.\n- Further expansion is possible, resulting in a 5x5 square of 'H's.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 5x5 square is at position (4, 7).\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square is:\n\n<<<[4, 7]>>>"
