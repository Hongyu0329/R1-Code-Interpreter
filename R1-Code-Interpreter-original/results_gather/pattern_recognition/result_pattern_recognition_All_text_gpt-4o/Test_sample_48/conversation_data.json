    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix is 14 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For each position, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Check Square Validity**: For each potential square, ensure that all characters in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square boundaries.\n\n5. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem states that the answer is unique, so there should be only one largest square.\n\n6. **Determine Bottom-Right Corner**: Once the largest square is identified, calculate the position of its bottom-right corner. This is done by adding the side length minus one to the row and column of the top-left corner of the square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Finally, output the row and column of the bottom-right corner of the largest square in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- Identify a 3x3 square starting at position (5, 2) with the character 'P':\n  ```\n  P P P\n  P P P\n  P P P\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (7, 4).\n- Check for larger squares, but since the problem states the answer is unique, this is the largest square.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (7, 4).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 4]>>>"
