    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate through the Matrix**: We will check each possible starting point in the matrix where a 3x3 square can fit. This means we will iterate from row 0 to row 5 and column 0 to column 3, as these are the last positions where a 3x3 square can start.\n\n4. **Check for 3x3 Squares**: For each starting point, we will check if a 3x3 square of the same character exists. If it does, we will note the bottom-right corner of this square.\n\n5. **Identify Larger Squares**: If a 3x3 square is found, we will also check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) by checking additional rows and columns.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at (0,0) and check for a 3x3 square. Continue this process for each possible starting point.\n- At position (4,1), we find a 3x3 square of 'S':\n  ```\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (6,3).\n\n- Check if this can be extended to a larger square:\n  - A 4x4 square is possible:\n    ```\n    S S S S\n    S S S S\n    S S S S\n    S S S S\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at (7,4).\n\n- No larger square is possible because extending further would require checking out of matrix bounds.\n\nThus, the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is a 4x4 square with the bottom-right corner at (7,4).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[7, 4]>>>"
