    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit. \n   - The maximum starting row index for a 3x3 square is 7 (since 7 + 3 = 10, the total number of rows).\n   - The maximum starting column index for a 3x3 square is 5 (since 5 + 3 = 8, the total number of columns).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: \n   - For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character.\n   - This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: \n   - Once a valid square is found, note the bottom-right corner of the square.\n   - For a square starting at (i, j) with side length `l`, the bottom-right corner is at (i + l - 1, j + l - 1).\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: \n   - The problem states that the answer is unique, so we only need to find one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left of the matrix.\n- At position (3, 1), we find the character 'I'.\n- Check the 3x3 square starting at (3, 1):\n  ```\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  ```\n- All characters are 'I', so this is a valid 3x3 square.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (5, 3).\n\nThus, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[5, 3]>>>"
