    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 12 rows and 11 columns.\n\n2. **Minimum Square Size**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, ..., up to the maximum possible square size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters within the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square boundaries.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one valid square of the required size.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move to the bottom-right, checking for squares of increasing size.\n- For each potential square, ensure all characters are the same.\n- The largest square that fits the criteria will have its bottom-right corner as the answer.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find that there is a 5x5 square of 'H' characters starting at row 6, column 4 and ending at row 10, column 8. This is the largest square that fits the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 10, column 8.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[10, 8]>>>"
