    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The matrix has 13 rows and 11 columns.\n\n2. **Minimum Square Size**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3. This means we need to check for 3x3 squares, 4x4 squares, and so on.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. For a square of size `n`, the top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 13 - n` and `j <= 11 - n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner, which is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, there is only one largest square with a side length of at least 3. We need to ensure we find the largest possible square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start by checking for 3x3 squares, then 4x4, and so on.\n- Upon inspection, we find that there is a 6x6 square composed of the character 'M' starting at position (7, 3) and ending at position (12, 8).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (12, 8).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[12, 8]>>>"
