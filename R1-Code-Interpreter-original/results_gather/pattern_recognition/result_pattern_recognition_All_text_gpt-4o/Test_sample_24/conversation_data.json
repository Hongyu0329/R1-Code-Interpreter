    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 14 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is valid if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner of a potential square can be at any position (i, j) where i and j are such that a square of the desired size can fit within the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed with the same character. This involves checking all characters in the square to ensure they are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner. The bottom-right corner of a square with top-left corner (i, j) and size n is at (i + n - 1, j + n - 1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we are looking for the largest square. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem implies there is only one correct answer, so we assume the largest square is unique.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check for squares of increasing size.\n- The largest square found in the matrix is a 6x6 square of 'Y' characters.\n- The top-left corner of this square is at (5, 2).\n- The bottom-right corner of this 6x6 square is at (10, 7).\n\nThus, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square is:\n\n<<<[10, 7]>>>"
