    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 14 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of size 3x3, the top-left corner can be at most at row 11 and column 6, because the square needs space to extend 2 more rows and columns.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed by verifying that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one largest square. We need to ensure that we find the largest possible square and its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- For each position, check for squares of increasing size (3x3, 4x4, etc.) until the matrix boundaries are reached.\n- Verify that all characters in the square are the same.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nUpon analyzing the matrix, we find that the largest square of uniform characters is a 4x4 square of 'H' characters starting at row 9, column 1 and ending at row 12, column 4.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 12, column 4.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[12, 4]>>>"
