    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is 7 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2) if the top-left corner is at (i, j).\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For a square to be valid, all characters in the square must be the same. This means checking all characters from (i, j) to (i+2, j+2) for a 3x3 square.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We need to iterate over all possible top-left corners (i, j) where a 3x3 square can fit. This means i can range from 0 to 4 (since 4+2=6, the last row index) and j can range from 0 to 3 (since 3+2=5, the last column index).\n\n5. **Check Each Square**: For each potential top-left corner, check if the 3x3 square is composed of the same character.\n\n6. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner (i+2, j+2).\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For the square starting at (2, 3), the characters are:\n  - Row 2: Z, Z, Z\n  - Row 3: Z, Z, Z\n  - Row 4: Z, Z, Z\n- All characters in this 3x3 square are 'Z', so it is a valid square.\n\nThe bottom-right corner of this square is at (4, 5).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 5]>>>"
