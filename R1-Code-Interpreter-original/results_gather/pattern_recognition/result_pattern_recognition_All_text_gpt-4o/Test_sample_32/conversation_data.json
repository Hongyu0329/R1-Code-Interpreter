    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The matrix has 7 rows and 13 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, etc., up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Character Consistency**: For a square to be valid, all characters in the square must be the same.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from each possible top-left corner of a square.\n   - For each top-left corner, check all possible square sizes starting from 3x3.\n   - Ensure that the square fits within the matrix boundaries.\n\n5. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters are the same.\n\n6. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n7. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one valid square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from each position in the matrix as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n- For each position, check for squares of increasing size, ensuring they fit within the matrix.\n- For each square, verify that all characters are the same.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting from position (2, 10), we can form a 3x3 square with the character 'B':\n  ```\n  B B B\n  B B B\n  B B B\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (4, 12).\n\nThis is the only valid square of at least 3x3 in the matrix, and thus the answer is unique.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 12]>>>"
