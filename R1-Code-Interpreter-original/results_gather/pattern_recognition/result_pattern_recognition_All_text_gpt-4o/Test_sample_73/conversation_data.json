    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 14 rows and 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a square. For a square of size 3x3, the top-left corner can be at most at row 11 and column 5 (since 14 - 3 = 11 and 8 - 3 = 5).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner. For a 3x3 square starting at (i, j), the bottom-right corner is at (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: If there are multiple squares, identify the largest one. In this problem, we are told the answer is unique, so there should be only one valid square of the largest size.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner.\n- At position (6, 5), we find a 3x3 square of 'C's:\n  ```\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (8, 7).\n\n- No larger square can be formed because the matrix does not have enough rows or columns to accommodate a larger uniform square.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (8, 7).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[8, 7]>>>"
