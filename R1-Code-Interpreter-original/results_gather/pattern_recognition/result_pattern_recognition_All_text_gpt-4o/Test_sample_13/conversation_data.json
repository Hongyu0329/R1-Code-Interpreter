    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, we need to understand the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 8 rows and 16 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of at least 3x3. This means we need to check for squares starting from each position in the matrix and ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a 3x3 square can fit. This means iterating from row 0 to row 5 and column 0 to column 13, as starting from row 6 or column 14 would not allow a 3x3 square to fit.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking the character at the starting point and ensuring all characters in the 3x3 (or larger) area are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner. For a 3x3 square starting at (i, j), the bottom-right corner would be at (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Check Larger Squares**: If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) by checking additional rows and columns.\n\n7. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (2, 5), we find a 3x3 square of 'I's:\n  ```\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (4, 7).\n\n- Check if this can be extended to a larger square:\n  - A 4x4 square of 'I's is also possible:\n    ```\n    I I I I\n    I I I I\n    I I I I\n    I I I I\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at (5, 8).\n\n- Check for a 5x5 square:\n  - A 5x5 square of 'I's is possible:\n    ```\n    I I I I I\n    I I I I I\n    I I I I I\n    I I I I I\n    I I I I I\n    ```\n    The bottom-right corner of this 5x5 square is at (6, 9).\n\n- Check for a 6x6 square:\n  - A 6x6 square of 'I's is not possible because the next row contains different characters.\n\nThus, the largest square found is a 5x5 square with the bottom-right corner at (6, 9).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 9]>>>"
