    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 13 rows and 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2) if the top-left corner is at (i, j).\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner (i, j) of a square. The maximum value for i is 10 (13 - 3) and for j is 12 (15 - 3) to ensure the square fits within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each top-left corner, check if the 3x3 or larger square is composed of the same character. This involves checking all characters in the square to see if they are the same.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one such square. We need to ensure that we find the largest possible square, which will naturally have the largest bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For the given matrix, the character 'S' forms a 5x5 square starting at (1, 4) and ending at (5, 8).\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (5, 8).\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is:\n\n<<<[5, 8]>>>"
