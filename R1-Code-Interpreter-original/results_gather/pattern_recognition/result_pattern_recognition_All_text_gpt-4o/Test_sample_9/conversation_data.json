    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10x10, meaning it has 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit. \n   - The largest possible starting point for a 3x3 square is at row 7, column 7, because the square needs to fit within the 10x10 matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: \n   - For each potential starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger is composed of the same character.\n   - This involves checking all characters in the square to ensure they are identical.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: \n   - Once a valid square is found, note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n   - The bottom-right corner of a square starting at (i, j) with side length `n` is at (i+n-1, j+n-1).\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: \n   - The problem states that the answer is unique, so we only need to find one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- At position (2, 0), we have the character 'K'. \n- Check the 3x3 square starting at (2, 0):\n  ```\n  K K K\n  K K K\n  K K K\n  ```\n  All characters are 'K', so this is a valid 3x3 square.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (4, 2).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting at (2, 0):\n  - A 4x4 square starting at (2, 0) is also composed entirely of 'K':\n    ```\n    K K K K\n    K K K K\n    K K K K\n    K K K K\n    ```\n  - The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at (5, 3).\n\n- Since the problem states the answer is unique, and we have found a valid square, we can conclude that this is the solution.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position:\n\n<<<[5, 3]>>>"
