    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is 7 rows by 9 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. This means we will start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix and move towards the bottom-right, ensuring that we have enough space to form a square of at least 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner of a square, check if all characters in the 3x3 (or larger) region are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a 3x3 square. For each starting point, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed.\n\n6. **Ensure Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For each 3x3 square, check if all characters are the same.\n- If a larger square is possible (e.g., 4x4), check for uniformity in that larger square as well.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- Starting at position (3, 0), we find a 3x3 square of 'J's:\n  ```\n  J J J\n  J J J\n  J J J\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (5, 2).\n\n- No other 3x3 or larger uniform squares are found elsewhere in the matrix.\n\nThus, the unique bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (5, 2).\n\nThe answer is: <<<[5, 2]>>>"
