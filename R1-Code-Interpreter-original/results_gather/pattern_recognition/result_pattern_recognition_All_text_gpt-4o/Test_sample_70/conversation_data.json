    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. This means we will start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix and move towards the bottom-right, ensuring that we have enough space to form a square of at least 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner of a square, check if all characters in the 3x3 (or larger) area are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Sizes**: Start with the smallest possible square (3x3) and increase the size if possible, checking for larger squares.\n\n6. **Ensure Uniqueness**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one valid square of the required size.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right and down, checking for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (4, 2), we find a 3x3 square of 'C's:\n  ```\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (6, 4).\n\n- Check if this square can be extended to a larger size:\n  - A 4x4 square starting at (4, 2) would require checking the next row and column, but the characters do not match.\n  - Therefore, the largest square starting at (4, 2) is 3x3.\n\n- Continue checking the rest of the matrix for any other 3x3 or larger squares. No other such squares are found.\n\nThus, the unique square with a side length of at least 3 is the one found at (4, 2) with a bottom-right corner at (6, 4).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 4]>>>"
