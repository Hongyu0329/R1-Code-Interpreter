    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 12 rows and 13 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and iterate over each possible starting point for a square. For a square of size 3x3, the top-left corner can be at most at row 9 and column 10 (since 9+3=12 and 10+3=13).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- For each 3x3 square, ensure all characters are the same.\n- Continue this process for larger squares if possible.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at row 1, column 6, we have a 3x3 square of 'R's:\n  ```\n  R R R\n  R R R\n  R R R\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at row 3, column 8.\n\n- No larger square of the same character can be formed in this matrix.\n\nThus, the position of the bottom-right corner of the unique square with a side length of at least 3 is:\n\n<<<[3, 8]>>>"
