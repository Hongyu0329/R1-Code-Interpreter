    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 6 and column 4, because the square needs to fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all characters in the 3x3 sub-matrix are the same.\n\n5. **Identify Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, calculate the bottom-right corner. For a 3x3 square starting at (i, j), the bottom-right corner is at (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- At position (2, 2), we find a 3x3 square of 'C's:\n  ```\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (4, 4).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, this is the only square that meets the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[4, 4]>>>"
