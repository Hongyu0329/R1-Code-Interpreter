    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 11 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with sides of at least length 3, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i and j are such that a square of the required size can fit within the matrix bounds.\n\n4. **Check for Squares**: For each top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed. We will check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Track the Largest Square**: We will keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem states that the answer is unique, so we assume there is only one largest square.\n\n6. **Output the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once the largest square is identified, we will output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- For each valid top-left corner (i, j), check if a 3x3 square can be formed with the same character.\n- Continue checking for larger squares (4x4, 5x5, etc.) until the largest possible square is found.\n- The largest square found in the matrix is a 5x5 square of 'Y' characters, starting at (2, 6) and ending at (6, 10).\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 6, column 10.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 10]>>>"
