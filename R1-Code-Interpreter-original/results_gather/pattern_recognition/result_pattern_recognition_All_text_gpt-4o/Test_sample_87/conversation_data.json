    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 13 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3. This means we need to check for uniformity of characters in a 3x3 sub-matrix and larger.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at most at row 10 and column 4, because a 3x3 square starting at row 11 or column 5 would exceed the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if the 3x3 (or larger) sub-matrix is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we are looking for the largest square that fits the criteria.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For each 3x3 square, check if all characters are the same.\n- If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) while maintaining uniformity.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- The only 3x3 square composed of the same character is found at the bottom of the matrix, starting at row 10, column 0.\n- The characters 'X' form a 3x3 square from (10, 0) to (12, 2).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 12, column 2.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[12, 2]>>>"
