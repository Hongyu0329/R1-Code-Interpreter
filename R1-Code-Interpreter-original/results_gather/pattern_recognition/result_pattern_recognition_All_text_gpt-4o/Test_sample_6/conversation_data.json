    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, where all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We need to iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i <= 7 and j <= 3, because a 3x3 square starting at (i, j) will extend to (i+2, j+2).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if the 3x3 (or larger) square is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, note the position of its bottom-right corner, which will be (i+2, j+2) for a 3x3 square.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- At position (7, 2), we have the following 3x3 square:\n  ```\n  A A A\n  A A A\n  A A A\n  ```\n  All characters are 'A', so this is a valid 3x3 square.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (9, 4).\n\n- Check for larger squares starting from (7, 2):\n  - A 4x4 square would extend beyond the matrix bounds, so the largest valid square here is 3x3.\n\nSince this is the only valid square of at least 3x3 size, the bottom-right corner of this square is the answer.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 4]>>>"
