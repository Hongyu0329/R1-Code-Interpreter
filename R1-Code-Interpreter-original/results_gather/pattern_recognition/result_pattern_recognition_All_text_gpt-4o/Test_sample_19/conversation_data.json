    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 6 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with sides of at least 3, meaning we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, etc., squares.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 3 and column 9, because the square needs to fit within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, calculate the bottom-right corner's coordinates.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we only need to find one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and check for 3x3 squares.\n- For each 3x3 square, check if all characters are the same.\n- If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) with the same character.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nBy examining the matrix:\n\n- Starting from position (3, 8), we find a 3x3 square of 'L's:\n  ```\n  L L L\n  L L L\n  L L L\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (5, 10).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position:\n\n<<<[5, 10]>>>"
