    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 13 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, etc., up to the maximum possible square that can fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Matrix**: We will iterate over each cell in the matrix and consider it as the potential top-left corner of a square.\n\n4. **Check for Squares**: For each potential top-left corner, we will check if a square of increasing size (3x3, 4x4, etc.) can be formed. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square. The bottom-right corner of a square with top-left corner at (i, j) and side length `n` is at (i + n - 1, j + n - 1).\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem states that the answer is unique, so we assume there is only one largest square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for squares of increasing size.\n- For each potential square, ensure all characters are the same.\n- The largest square found in the matrix is a 4x4 square of 'W' characters starting at (5, 5) and ending at (8, 8).\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 8, column 7.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 7]>>>"
