    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 12 rows and 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2) if the top-left corner is at (i, j).\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner (i, j) of a square. The maximum value for i is 9 (since 9+2=11, the last row), and for j is 4 (since 4+2=6, the last column).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each top-left corner (i, j), check if the 3x3 sub-matrix starting at (i, j) is composed of the same character. This involves checking the characters at positions:\n   - (i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)\n   - (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2)\n   - (i+2, j), (i+2, j+1), (i+2, j+2)\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform 3x3 square is found, record the bottom-right corner (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Check for Larger Squares**: If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (4x4, 5x5, etc.) by checking additional rows and columns.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- Upon checking, we find that the 3x3 square starting at (2, 4) is composed entirely of 'N':\n  ```\n  N N N\n  N N N\n  N N N\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (4, 6).\n\nSince the problem states the answer is unique, and we have found a valid 3x3 square, we conclude that this is the required square.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[4, 6]>>>"
