    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3, 4x4, etc. The squares must be composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix and check for squares of increasing size.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and iterate over each cell as a potential top-left corner of a square.\n- For each cell, attempt to form squares of increasing size (3x3, 4x4, etc.) as long as the square fits within the matrix boundaries.\n- For each square, check if all characters are the same.\n- If a valid square is found, note the bottom-right corner.\n- Continue this process until the entire matrix is checked.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at position (2, 4) with character 'J', we can form a 3x3 square:\n  ```\n  J J J\n  J J J\n  J J J\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (4, 6).\n\n- Attempting to form larger squares from this position or any other does not yield a valid square of uniform characters.\n\nThus, the only valid square with a side length of at least 3 is the 3x3 square starting at (2, 4) and ending at (4, 6).\n\nThe bottom-right corner of this square is at position (4, 6).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 6]>>>"
