    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning they are 3x3 or larger, and all characters in the square must be the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a 3x3 square. The top-left corner can be at most at row 5 and column 4, because a 3x3 square starting at row 5, column 4 will end at row 7, column 6.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if the 3x3 square is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at (0,0) and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- Continue this process for each possible starting point.\n\nUpon checking the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at (4,4), the 3x3 square is:\n  ```\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  C C C\n  ```\n  All characters are 'C', so this is a valid square.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (6,6).\n\nNo other 3x3 or larger square with uniform characters exists in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[6, 6]>>>"
