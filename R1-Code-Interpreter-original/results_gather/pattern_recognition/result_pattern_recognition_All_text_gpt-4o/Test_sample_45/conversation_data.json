    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n\n```\nY Y J F J V M\nC O D K W M P\nF B K K K A O\nU P K K K X H\nF R K K K J Y\nS Y M C V P G\n```\n\n1. **Identify potential squares**: We need to look for squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we need to check for 3x3, 4x4, etc., squares.\n\n2. **Check for 3x3 squares**: \n   - Start from the top-left corner and move right and down to check for 3x3 squares.\n   - A 3x3 square will have its top-left corner at (i, j) and bottom-right corner at (i+2, j+2).\n\n3. **Iterate through the matrix**:\n   - For each position (i, j) in the matrix, check if a 3x3 square can be formed.\n   - Ensure that the character at (i, j) is the same for all positions in the 3x3 square.\n\n4. **Check larger squares**:\n   - If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a 4x4 square, and so on, by checking the next row and column.\n\n5. **Find the unique square**:\n   - According to the problem, there is a unique square with a side length of at least 3.\n   - We need to find the bottom-right corner of this square.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step:\n\n- Start from (0, 0) and check for 3x3 squares:\n  - At (2, 2), we have a 3x3 square of 'K':\n    ```\n    K K K\n    K K K\n    K K K\n    ```\n  - The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at (4, 4).\n\n- Check if this can be extended to a larger square:\n  - Check for a 4x4 square starting at (1, 1):\n    ```\n    B K K K\n    P K K K\n    R K K K\n    ```\n  - The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at (4, 4).\n\n- Since the problem states the answer is unique, and we have found a 4x4 square, this must be the square we are looking for.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (4, 4).\n\nFinal answer: <<<[4, 4]>>>"
