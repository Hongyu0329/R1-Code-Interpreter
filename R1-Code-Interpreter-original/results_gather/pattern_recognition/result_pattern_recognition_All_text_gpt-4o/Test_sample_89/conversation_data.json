    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, where all characters in the square are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i <= 9 and j <= 5, because a 3x3 square starting at (i, j) will extend to (i+2, j+2).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each top-left corner, check if the 3x3 square (or larger) is composed of the same character. This involves checking all characters in the square to ensure they are identical.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner, which is (i+2, j+2) for a 3x3 square starting at (i, j).\n\n6. **Identify the Unique Solution**: According to the problem, there is a unique solution, meaning only one such square exists in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- At position (5, 1), we find a 3x3 square of 'H':\n  ```\n  H H H\n  H H H\n  H H H\n  ```\n  This square is uniform and meets the criteria.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (7, 3).\n\nThus, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[7, 3]>>>"
