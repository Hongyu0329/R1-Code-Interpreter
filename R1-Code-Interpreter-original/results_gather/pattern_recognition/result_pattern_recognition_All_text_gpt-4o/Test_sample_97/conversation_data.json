    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix is 8 rows by 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its top-left corner at position (i, j) and its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2).\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a 3x3 square. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i ≤ 5 and j ≤ 12, because the square needs to fit within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if all characters in the 3x3 square are the same. This involves checking the characters at positions:\n   - (i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)\n   - (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2)\n   - (i+2, j), (i+2, j+1), (i+2, j+2)\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform 3x3 square is found, record the bottom-right corner, which is at position (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Check for Larger Squares**: If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (e.g., 4x4, 5x5) by checking additional rows and columns. Continue this process until the largest possible square is found.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the bottom-right corner of this square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n- At position (5, 10), we find a 3x3 square of 'E's:\n  - (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12)\n  - (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 12)\n  - (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12)\n\n- Check if this can be extended to a larger square. In this case, it cannot be extended further because the next row or column would contain different characters.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (7, 12).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 12]>>>"
