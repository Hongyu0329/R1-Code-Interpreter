    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 7 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Minimum Square Size**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We need to check each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from 0 to 4 (since 7 - 3 = 4) and `j` ranges from 0 to 9 (since 12 - 3 = 9).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner `(i, j)`, check if the 3x3 sub-matrix starting at `(i, j)` is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform 3x3 square is found, the bottom-right corner of this square will be at `(i+2, j+2)`.\n\n6. **Check for Larger Squares**: If a 3x3 square is found, check if it can be extended to a larger square (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, etc.) by checking additional rows and columns.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start checking from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and move right and down.\n- At position `(1, 8)`, we find a 3x3 square of 'S':\n  ```\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  S S S\n  ```\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is `(3, 10)`.\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, and we have found a 3x3 square, we can conclude that this is the only square of at least size 3x3 in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the square are:\n\n<<<[3, 10]>>>"
