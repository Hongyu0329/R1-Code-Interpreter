    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix is 9 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We will iterate over each possible starting point in the matrix where a 3x3 square can fit. This means iterating from row 0 to row 6 and column 0 to column 9, as starting from row 7 or column 10 would not allow a 3x3 square to fit.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each starting point, check if a 3x3 square (or larger) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all elements in the 3x3 sub-matrix are the same.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner. For a square starting at (i, j) with side length 3, the bottom-right corner will be at (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Identify the Unique Solution**: According to the problem, there is a unique solution. This means there is only one such square in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- At position (0, 1), we find a 3x3 square of 'P':\n  ```\n  P P P\n  P P P\n  P P P\n  ```\n  The bottom-right corner of this square is at (2, 3).\n\n- Check for larger squares or other 3x3 squares, but according to the problem, the answer is unique, so this is the only valid square.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 3]>>>"
