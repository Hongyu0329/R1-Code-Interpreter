    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8 rows by 10 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Criteria for a Square**: \n   - The square must be composed of the same character.\n   - Each side of the square must have a length of at least 3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**:\n   - Start from each position in the matrix and attempt to form a square.\n   - Check if a square of size 3x3 or larger can be formed starting from that position.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**:\n   - For each potential square, ensure all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**:\n   - If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Ensure Uniqueness**:\n   - The problem states the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one valid square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check each position to see if it can be the top-left corner of a square.\n- For each position, attempt to form squares of increasing size (3x3, 4x4, etc.) until the matrix boundaries are reached.\n- For each potential square, check if all characters within the square are the same.\n- If a valid square is found, note the bottom-right corner.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at position (2, 3) with character 'I', we can form a 3x3 square:\n  ```\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  ```\n  - The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (4, 5).\n\n- Attempting to form larger squares or starting from other positions does not yield any other valid squares of size 3x3 or larger.\n\nThus, the unique square with a side length of at least 3 is found, and its bottom-right corner is at position (4, 5).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 5]>>>"
