    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We are tasked with finding the bottom-right corner of such a square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 15 rows by 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix where a square of size 3x3 or larger could fit. This means iterating over each cell in the matrix that could be the top-left corner of such a square.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) can be formed with the same character. This involves checking:\n   - The rows and columns from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the square.\n   - Ensure all characters in these rows and columns are the same.\n\n5. **Identify the Largest Square**: As we find squares, we need to keep track of the largest one found. Since the problem states the answer is unique, there should be only one largest square.\n\n6. **Output the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and check for 3x3 squares.\n- Continue checking larger squares as long as they fit within the matrix dimensions.\n- For each square, ensure all characters are the same.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at row 11, column 0, we have a 3x3 square of 'X's:\n  ```\n  X X X\n  X X X\n  X X X\n  ```\n  This square has its bottom-right corner at row 13, column 2.\n\n- No larger square of the same character can be formed elsewhere in the matrix.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 13, column 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[13, 2]>>>"
