    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix is 12 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for 3x3, 4x4, ..., up to the largest possible square that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of side length `n`, the top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 12 - n` and `j <= 12 - n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner `(i, j)`, check if all characters in the `n x n` square starting at `(i, j)` are the same.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform square is found, record the bottom-right corner, which is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Continue this process for increasing values of `n` until no larger square can be found. The largest square found will have its bottom-right corner as the answer.\n\n7. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we only need to find the largest square.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with `n = 3` and check for 3x3 squares.\n- Increase `n` and check for larger squares until no larger square can be found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find that the largest square of uniform characters is composed of the character 'Q' and is a 6x6 square. The top-left corner of this square is at `(1, 3)`, and the bottom-right corner is at `(6, 8)`.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 6, column 8.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[6, 8]>>>"
