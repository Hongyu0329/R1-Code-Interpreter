    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 8 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger, composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i <= 5 and j <= 3, because a 3x3 square needs at least 3 rows and 3 columns.\n\n4. **Check for 3x3 Squares**: For each top-left corner, check if a 3x3 square can be formed with the same character. This involves checking the characters at positions:\n   - (i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)\n   - (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2)\n   - (i+2, j), (i+2, j+1), (i+2, j+2)\n\n5. **Identify the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a 3x3 square is found, the bottom-right corner of this square is at position (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Check for Larger Squares**: If needed, check for larger squares (4x4, 5x5, etc.) by extending the square and ensuring all characters are the same.\n\n7. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- At position (2, 1), we have:\n  - V V V\n  - V V V\n  - V V V\n\n  This forms a 3x3 square with the character 'V'.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (4, 3).\n\n- Check for larger squares: Extending this to a 4x4 square would require checking (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3), but (5, 3) is 'R', not 'V', so a larger square is not possible.\n\nThus, the only square with a side length of at least 3 is the 3x3 square starting at (2, 1) and ending at (4, 3).\n\nThe bottom-right corner of this square is at position (4, 3).\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[4, 3]>>>"
