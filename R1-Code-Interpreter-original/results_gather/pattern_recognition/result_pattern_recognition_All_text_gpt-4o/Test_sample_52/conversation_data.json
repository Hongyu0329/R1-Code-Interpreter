    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 13 rows by 12 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means:\n   - The top-left corner of the square should have the same character as the rest of the square.\n   - All characters in the square should be the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 10` and `j <= 9` because the square needs to fit within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Squares**: For each top-left corner `(i, j)`, check if a square of side length 3 or more can be formed:\n   - Check if the characters in the 3x3 sub-matrix starting at `(i, j)` are the same.\n   - If they are, check for larger squares (4x4, 5x5, etc.) until the characters differ or the square exceeds matrix bounds.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and move right and down.\n- At position `(4, 1)`, we find a 3x3 square of 'F's.\n- Check for larger squares:\n  - 4x4 square of 'F's at `(4, 1)`.\n  - 5x5 square of 'F's at `(4, 1)`.\n  - 6x6 square of 'F's at `(4, 1)`.\n  - 7x7 square of 'F's at `(4, 1)`.\n- The largest square of 'F's is 7x7, with the bottom-right corner at `(10, 7)`.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 10, column 7.\n\nThe answer is <<<[10, 7]>>>."
