    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning 3x3 or larger.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square in the matrix. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 7 and column 3, because the square needs to fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a 3x3 or larger square can be formed with the same character. This involves checking if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- At position (1, 1), we find a 3x3 square of 'I's:\n  ```\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  I I I\n  ```\n  This square is uniform and valid.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 square is at position (3, 3).\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, this is the only valid square of at least 3x3 size in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[3, 3]>>>"
