    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix where each side of the square is composed of the same character and has a length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is valid if all characters on its boundary are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start with the largest possible square size and work downwards. This ensures that the first valid square found is the largest.\n   - For each potential top-left corner of a square, check if a square of the current size can be formed.\n\n4. **Boundary Check**: For a square of size `n`, ensure that:\n   - The top row, bottom row, left column, and right column of the square are all composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The result should be in the format `<<<[row, column]>>>`.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the largest possible square size, which is 6x6 (since the matrix is 9x8, the largest square that can fit is 6x6).\n- Check each possible top-left corner for a 6x6 square.\n- If no 6x6 square is found, check for 5x5, then 4x4, and finally 3x3.\n\nUpon checking the matrix, we find:\n\n- A 6x6 square of 'V' characters starting at (3, 3) and ending at (8, 8).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at row 8, column 7.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[8, 7]>>>"
