    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 13 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3. This means we will check for squares starting from each position in the matrix and see if a 3x3 or larger square can be formed.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Iterate Over the Matrix**: Start from each position in the matrix and attempt to form squares of increasing size, checking for uniformity.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is found, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left of the matrix and move right and down, checking for squares.\n- For each starting point, attempt to form a 3x3 square and check if all characters are the same.\n- If a 3x3 square is found, attempt to expand it to 4x4, 5x5, etc., as long as the characters remain the same and the square fits within the matrix bounds.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- Starting at position (1, 2), we can form a 3x3 square with the character 'Q'.\n- This square can be expanded to a 4x4, 5x5, and finally a 6x6 square, all with the character 'Q'.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 6x6 square is at position (6, 7).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[6, 7]>>>"
