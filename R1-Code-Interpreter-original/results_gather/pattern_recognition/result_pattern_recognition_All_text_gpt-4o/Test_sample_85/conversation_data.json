    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, determine the dimensions of the matrix. The given matrix has 15 rows and 15 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square is defined by having the same character on all its sides.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the top-left corner of the matrix and iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of size `n`, the top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 15 - n` and `j <= 15 - n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, check if all characters in the square are the same. This involves checking all rows and columns within the square.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner, which is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, there is only one square of the largest size. We need to ensure we find the largest possible square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the coordinates of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start by checking for 3x3 squares, then 4x4, and so on, up to the maximum possible size.\n- Upon inspection, we find a 5x5 square composed of the character 'C' starting at position (5, 6) and ending at position (9, 10).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square is at position (9, 10).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 10]>>>"
