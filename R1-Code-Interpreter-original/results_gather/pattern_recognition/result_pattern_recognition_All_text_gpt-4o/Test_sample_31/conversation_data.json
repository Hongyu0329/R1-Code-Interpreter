    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. A square of size 3x3 will have its top-left corner at position (i, j) and its bottom-right corner at position (i+2, j+2).\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner (i, j), check if the 3x3 sub-matrix starting at (i, j) is composed of the same character.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: \n   - The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at any position (i, j) where i ≤ 6 and j ≤ 3, because the bottom-right corner must fit within the matrix dimensions.\n\n5. **Check Each 3x3 Sub-Matrix**:\n   - For each (i, j), check if the characters at positions (i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2), (i+2, j), (i+2, j+1), and (i+2, j+2) are the same.\n\n6. **Find the Unique Square**:\n   - According to the problem, there is a unique square that satisfies the condition. We need to find this square and note the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 sub-matrix.\n- At position (2, 0), we have:\n  ```\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  F F F\n  ```\n  All characters are 'F', forming a 3x3 square.\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (4, 2).\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, this is the only square that satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[4, 2]>>>"
