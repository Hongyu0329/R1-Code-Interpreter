    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 9 rows by 14 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with a side length of at least 3, meaning each side of the square must be at least 3 characters long and composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: We need to check each possible starting point in the matrix to see if it can be the top-left corner of a square with a side length of at least 3.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential square, we need to ensure that all characters in the square are the same.\n\n5. **Identify Bottom-Right Corner**: Once a valid square is found, calculate the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's go through the matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right and down, checking for squares.\n- For each position, check if a 3x3 square can be formed.\n- Ensure all characters in the 3x3 square are the same.\n- If a valid square is found, note the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Detailed Analysis**:\n\n- Starting from (0,0), check each position to see if it can be the top-left corner of a 3x3 square.\n- At position (3,2), we find the characters:\n  ```\n  R R R\n  R R R\n  R R R\n  ```\n  All characters are 'R', forming a valid 3x3 square.\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at position (5,4).\n\nSince the problem states that the answer is unique, this is the only valid square of at least 3x3 in the matrix.\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of the square is at position:\n\n<<<[5, 4]>>>"
