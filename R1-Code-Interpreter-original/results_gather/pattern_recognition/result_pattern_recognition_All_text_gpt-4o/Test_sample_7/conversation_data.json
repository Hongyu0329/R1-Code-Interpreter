    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 13 rows by 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for a 3x3 or larger square where all elements are the same.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: \n   - Start from each element in the matrix and attempt to form a square with increasing side lengths.\n   - For each starting point (i, j), check if a square of size 3x3, 4x4, etc., can be formed.\n   - Ensure that the square does not exceed the matrix boundaries.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: \n   - For each potential square, check if all elements in the square are the same.\n   - If they are, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n5. **Find the Largest Square**: \n   - Since the problem states the answer is unique, there is likely only one largest square.\n   - Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: \n   - Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left and move right and down, checking for squares.\n- At position (4, 0), we find a 4x4 square of 'G's:\n  ```\n  G G G G\n  G G G G\n  G G G G\n  G G G G\n  ```\n  - The bottom-right corner of this square is at (7, 3).\n\n- Check for larger squares, but since the problem states the answer is unique, this is likely the largest square.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with a side length of at least 3 is at position (7, 3).\n\nThe answer is <<<[7, 3]>>>."
