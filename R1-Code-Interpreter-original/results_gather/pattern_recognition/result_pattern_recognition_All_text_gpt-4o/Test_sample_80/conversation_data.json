    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 12 rows by 11 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of at least 3x3. This means we need to check for uniformity of characters in 3x3, 4x4, etc., up to the maximum possible square size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a 3x3 square, the top-left corner can be anywhere from row 0 to row 9 and column 0 to column 8.\n\n4. **Check Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if the 3x3 (or larger) area is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the square.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, we are looking for the largest square. If multiple squares of the same size are found, the problem implies there is only one correct answer, so we assume the largest square is unique.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with 3x3 squares and check each possible top-left corner.\n- For each valid 3x3 square, check if it can be extended to a 4x4 square, and so on.\n- Continue this process until the largest possible square is found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- A 4x4 square of 'M' characters starting at row 4, column 7 and ending at row 7, column 10.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 7, column 10.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 10]>>>"
