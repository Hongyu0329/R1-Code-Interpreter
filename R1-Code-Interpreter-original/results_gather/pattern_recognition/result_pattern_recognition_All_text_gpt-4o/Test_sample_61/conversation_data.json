    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of the largest such square.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 11 rows by 9 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to check for squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we need to check every possible 3x3, 4x4, ..., up to the maximum possible square size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: For each possible top-left corner of a square, check if a square of increasing size can be formed.\n\n4. **Check Square Validity**: For a square to be valid, all characters in the square must be the same. This includes checking all rows and columns within the square boundaries.\n\n5. **Track Largest Square**: Keep track of the largest square found and its bottom-right corner.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the row and column of its bottom-right corner.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and iterate through each possible starting point for a square.\n- For each starting point, attempt to form squares of increasing size.\n- Check if all characters in the current square are the same.\n- If a valid square is found, update the largest square if this one is larger.\n- Continue this process until all possible squares are checked.\n\nUpon analyzing the matrix, we find that the largest square of the same character is composed of the character 'F'. The largest such square is a 4x4 square starting at position (2, 2) and ending at position (5, 5).\n\nTherefore, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 5, column 5.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, 5]>>>"
