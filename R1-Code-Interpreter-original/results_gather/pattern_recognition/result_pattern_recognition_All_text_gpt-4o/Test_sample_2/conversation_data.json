    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have a side length of at least 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: First, note the dimensions of the matrix. The matrix has 12 rows and 11 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to identify squares of at least 3x3. This means we will check for squares starting from each position in the matrix and ensure that the square is composed of the same character.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner can be at any position (i, j) where i <= 9 and j <= 8, because a 3x3 square starting at (i, j) will extend to (i+2, j+2).\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each top-left corner, check if the 3x3 square is composed of the same character. This involves checking the characters at positions:\n   - (i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)\n   - (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2)\n   - (i+2, j), (i+2, j+1), (i+2, j+2)\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a 3x3 square is found, record the bottom-right corner, which is at (i+2, j+2).\n\n6. **Continue Searching**: Continue this process for all possible top-left corners to ensure that we find all squares of at least 3x3.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Since the problem states that the answer is unique, we will output the bottom-right corner of the square found.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- Upon checking, we find that starting from position (5, 6), the characters 'U' form a 3x3 square:\n  - (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)\n  - (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)\n  - (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)\n\n- The bottom-right corner of this square is at (7, 8).\n\nTherefore, the position of the bottom-right corner of the square is:\n\n<<<[7, 8]>>>"
