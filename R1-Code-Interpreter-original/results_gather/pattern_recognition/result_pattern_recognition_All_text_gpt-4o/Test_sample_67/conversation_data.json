    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that are composed of the same character and have a side length of at least 3. We will then find the bottom-right corner of these squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 15 rows by 13 columns.\n\n2. **Square Identification**: We need to find squares of the same character with a minimum side length of 3. This means we are looking for 3x3, 4x4, etc., up to the maximum possible size that fits within the matrix dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. For a square of size `n`, the top-left corner can be at any position `(i, j)` where `i <= 15 - n` and `j <= 13 - n`.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner `(i, j)`, check if the sub-matrix of size `n x n` starting at `(i, j)` is composed of the same character.\n\n5. **Record Bottom-Right Corner**: If a uniform square is found, record the bottom-right corner, which is `(i + n - 1, j + n - 1)`.\n\n6. **Find the Largest Square**: Since the problem states the answer is unique, there is only one largest square with a side length of at least 3. We need to ensure we find the largest such square.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Once the largest square is identified, output the bottom-right corner coordinates.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given matrix:\n\n- Start with the smallest possible square size, which is 3x3.\n- Check each possible top-left corner for a 3x3 square.\n- If a 3x3 square is found, check for larger squares (4x4, 5x5, etc.) starting from the same top-left corner.\n- Continue this process until the largest square is found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix, we find:\n\n- A 3x3 square of 'R' starting at (11, 1) and ending at (13, 3).\n- A 4x4 square of 'R' starting at (11, 1) and ending at (14, 4).\n\nThe largest square found is a 4x4 square of 'R', with the bottom-right corner at (14, 4).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[14, 4]>>>"
