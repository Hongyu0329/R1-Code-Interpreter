    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 11 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Square Requirements**: We are looking for squares with sides of at least 3, meaning the smallest square we are interested in is 3x3.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners**: We will iterate over each possible top-left corner of a square. The top-left corner of a 3x3 square can be at most at row 8 and column 5, because the square needs to fit within the matrix.\n\n4. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner, check if a square of increasing size (starting from 3x3) is composed of the same character. We will check squares of size 3x3, 4x4, etc., until we can no longer fit a square or the characters are not uniform.\n\n5. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a square is found, record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check for 3x3 squares.\n- For each 3x3 square, check if all characters are the same.\n- If they are, try to expand to a 4x4 square, and so on.\n- Record the bottom-right corner of the largest square found.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- Starting from (1, 1), we find a 3x3 square of 'W's.\n- This square can be expanded to a 4x4 square of 'W's.\n- The bottom-right corner of this 4x4 square is at (4, 4).\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of the largest square with sides of at least 3 is at row 4, column 4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, 4]>>>"
