    "To solve this problem, we need to identify squares in the given character matrix that have sides of at least length 3 and are composed of the same character. We will then find the bottom-right corner of such squares.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The matrix is 10 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Squares**: We need to look for squares of size 3x3 or larger. This means we will start checking from the top-left corner of the matrix and move towards the bottom-right, ensuring that we have enough space to form a square of at least 3x3.\n\n3. **Check for Uniformity**: For each potential top-left corner of a square, check if all characters in the 3x3 (or larger) area are the same.\n\n4. **Record the Bottom-Right Corner**: If a valid square is found, record the position of its bottom-right corner.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Since the matrix is 10x6, the largest possible square that can fit is 6x6. However, we are only interested in squares of size 3x3 or larger.\n\n6. **Unique Solution**: The problem states that the answer is unique, so we expect to find exactly one such square.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start from the top-left corner and check each possible 3x3 square.\n- For each 3x3 square, ensure all characters are the same.\n- Continue this process for larger squares if needed, but given the matrix size, we will likely find the solution with a 3x3 square.\n\nUpon examining the matrix:\n\n- The character 'L' forms a 3x3 square starting at row 4, column 2 and ending at row 6, column 4.\n\nThus, the bottom-right corner of this square is at row 6, column 4.\n\nThe answer is <<<[6, 4]>>>."
