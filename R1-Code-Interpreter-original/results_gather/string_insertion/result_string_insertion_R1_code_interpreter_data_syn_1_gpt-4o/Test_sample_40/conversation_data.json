    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CEABCCBCDEDCDEAAD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we go through the string.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they are defined.\n2. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the specified character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from left to right, taking into account the changes made by previous insertions.\n\nTo implement this, we can use a loop to iterate through the string and a list to keep track of the characters, allowing us to insert new characters as needed. We will then join the list back into a string after processing.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = list(s)\n    while i < len(result) - 3:\n        if result[i:i+4] == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']:\n            result.insert(i+4, 'A')\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif result[i:i+4] == ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E']:\n            result.insert(i+4, 'B')\n            i += 5\n        elif result[i:i+4] == ['C', 'D', 'E', 'A']:\n            result.insert(i+4, 'C')\n            i += 5\n        elif result[i:i+4] == ['D', 'E', 'A', 'B']:\n            result.insert(i+4, 'D')\n            i += 5\n        elif result[i:i+4] == ['E', 'A', 'B', 'C']:\n            result.insert(i+4, 'E')\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"CEABCCBCDEDCDEAAD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the resulting string. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"CEABCECBCDEBDCDEACAD\". \n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. Start with the string \"CEABCCBCDEDCDEAAD\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert 'A' after it. The first occurrence is at index 2, but there is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert 'B' after it. The first occurrence is at index 6, resulting in \"CEABCCBCDEBDCDEAAD\".\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert 'C' after it. The first occurrence is at index 11, resulting in \"CEABCCBCDEBDCDEACAD\".\n5. There are no occurrences of \"DEAB\" or \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nThe final string after applying the T operation is \"CEABCECBCDEBDCDEACAD\".\n\n<<<CEABCECBCDEBDCDEACAD>>>"
