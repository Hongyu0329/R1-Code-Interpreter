    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBBCDEBABCDDABCDD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we go through the string.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they are defined.\n2. For each substring found, insert the specified character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the point of the last insertion to ensure that all possible insertions are made in a single pass.\n4. Return the modified string after all insertions are complete.\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script that processes the string according to these rules.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(s) - 4:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"BBBCDEBABCDDABCDD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result after one T operation.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying one T operation is \"BBBCDEBBABCDADABCDAD\". \n\nThis result is obtained by scanning the string from left to right and applying the insertion rules as specified. Each time a specified substring is found, the corresponding character is inserted immediately after it, and the scan continues from the point of insertion.\n\n<<<BBBCDEBBABCDADABCDAD>>>"
