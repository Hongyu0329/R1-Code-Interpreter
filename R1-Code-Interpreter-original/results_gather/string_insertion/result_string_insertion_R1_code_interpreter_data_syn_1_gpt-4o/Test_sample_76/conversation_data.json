    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACEABCBEABCBBCDEE\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations to ensure that each insertion is based on the original string, not the modified one.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each identified substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since insertions are done from left to right, we should process the string in a single pass, keeping track of the positions where insertions are made.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We will write a Python script to automate this process. The script will iterate over the string, check for each of the specified substrings, and perform the necessary insertions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i <= len(s_list) - 4:\n        # Check each operation\n        for pattern, insert_char in operations:\n            # If the pattern matches, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(pattern):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no pattern matched\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"ACEABCBEABCBBCDEE\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(input_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the resulting string. Let's run the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"ACEABCEBEABCEBBCDEBE\". \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<ACEABCEBEABCEBBCDEBE>>>"
