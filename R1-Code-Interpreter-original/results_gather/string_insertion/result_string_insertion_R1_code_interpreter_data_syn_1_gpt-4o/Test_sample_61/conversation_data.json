    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDCDEADABCDA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations to ensure that each insertion is based on the original string, not the modified one.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify all occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the string.\n2. For each occurrence, insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n3. Ensure that the insertions are done from left to right, so the indices of the substrings are not affected by previous insertions.\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script that will:\n- Iterate over the string to find the specified substrings.\n- Keep track of the positions where insertions need to be made.\n- Perform the insertions in the correct order.\n\nLet's write the code to perform these operations:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    insertions = []\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(s) - 4:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'A'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'B'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'C'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'D'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'E'))\n        i += 1\n\n    # Insert characters from left to right\n    for index, char in sorted(insertions):\n        s = s[:index] + char + s[index:]\n    \n    return s\n\n# Given string\ns = \"DEABDCDEADABCDA\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find all the required substrings and perform the insertions in the correct order. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"DEABDDCDECADABACDA\". \n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. The original string is \"DEABDCDEADABCDA\".\n2. We look for the substrings:\n   - \"DEAB\" is found at index 0, so we insert 'D' after it, resulting in \"DEABDDCDEADABCDA\".\n   - \"CDEA\" is found at index 5, so we insert 'C' after it, resulting in \"DEABDDCDECADABCDA\".\n   - \"DABC\" is found at index 10, so we insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"DEABDDCDECADABACDA\".\n\nThe insertions are done from left to right, and the final string after one T operation is \"DEABDDCDECADABACDA\".\n\n<<<DEABDDCDECADABACDA>>>"
