    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each occurrence of these substrings, we insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since the operation is applied from left to right, we need to ensure that the insertions are done in the correct order to avoid affecting subsequent operations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for sub, insert in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(sub):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no operation was performed\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(input_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the result. Let's run the code to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \"BCDEBCCDEACECDEACAD\". This result is obtained by applying the T operation to the given string \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\" from left to right, following the specified rules for substring detection and character insertion.\n\nThe process involved:\n- Detecting the substring \"BCDE\" and inserting \"B\" after it.\n- Detecting the substring \"CDEA\" and inserting \"C\" after it.\n- Detecting the substring \"CDEA\" again and inserting \"C\" after it.\n\nThe final string after applying the T operation is \"BCDEBCCDEACECDEACAD\".\n\n<<<BCDEBCCDEACECDEACAD>>>"
