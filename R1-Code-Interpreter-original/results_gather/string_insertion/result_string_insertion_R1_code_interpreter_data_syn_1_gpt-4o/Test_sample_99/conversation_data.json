    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CADEABACDEADCDEAED\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we iterate through the string.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they are defined.\n2. For each substring found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Continue this process until the end of the string is reached.\n4. Ensure that the insertions are done in a way that respects the left-to-right order.\n\nTo implement this, we can use a loop to iterate through the string and a list to keep track of the characters, allowing us to insert new characters as needed. Let's write a Python script to perform this operation.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('A')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('B')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('C')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('D')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('E')\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"CADEABACDEADCDEAED\"\n# Apply the T operation\nnew_string = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the resulting string. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"CADEABDACDEACDCDEACED\". \n\nThe process involved iterating through the string, checking for the specified substrings, and inserting the corresponding characters as defined by the T operation. The insertions were done from left to right, ensuring that each operation was applied in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<CADEABDACDEACDCDEACED>>>"
