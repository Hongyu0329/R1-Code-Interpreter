    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\". If found, insert 'A' after it.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\". If found, insert 'B' after it.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\". If found, insert 'C' after it.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\". If found, insert 'D' after it.\n6. Look for the substring \"EABC\". If found, insert 'E' after it.\n\nWe need to perform these operations in the order given, and since insertions are done from left to right, the string will change as we perform each insertion. Let's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\"\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nThis code will apply the T operation to the string and print the resulting string. Let's execute it to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"EAABCDAADEABDECDEACAA\". \n\nLet's break down the process to ensure the correctness:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\".\n2. Find \"ABCD\" at index 2, insert 'A' to get \"EAABCDAADEABECDEAAA\".\n3. Find \"DEAB\" at index 7, insert 'D' to get \"EAABCDAADEABDECDEAAA\".\n4. Find \"CDEA\" at index 12, insert 'C' to get \"EAABCDAADEABDECDEACAA\".\n\nThe operations are performed from left to right, and the final string after one T operation is \"EAABCDAADEABDECDEACAA\".\n\n<<<EAABCDAADEABDECDEACAA>>>"
