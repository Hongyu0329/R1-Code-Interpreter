    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EDDEABDABCDBBCDEC\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"EDDEABDABCDBBCDEC\".\n2. Check for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n3. Check for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n4. Check for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n5. Check for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n6. Check for the substring \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n\nWe will implement this logic in a Python script to ensure accuracy and efficiency. The script will iterate over the string, apply the rules, and construct the new string.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the rules for the T operation\n    rules = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize the result string\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check each rule\n        for pattern, insert_char in rules:\n            if s[i:i+4] == pattern:\n                # If pattern matches, append the pattern and the insert character\n                result.append(s[i:i+4] + insert_char)\n                i += 4  # Move past the pattern\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no pattern matches, just append the current character\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Join the result list into a final string\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"EDDEABDABCDBBCDEC\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nnew_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and output the result. Let's run the code to see the final string after one operation T.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying one T operation is \"EDDEABDDABCDABBCDEBC\". \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<EDDEABDDABCDABBCDEBC>>>"
