    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AAABCDBBCDEECDEAD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations to ensure that each insertion is based on the original string, not the modified one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each occurrence of these substrings, we insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since the insertions are done from left to right, we should first identify all positions where insertions are needed and then perform the insertions in the correct order.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We can implement this using a loop to find each substring and a list to keep track of insertion positions and characters. After identifying all insertions, we can construct the new string.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these operations:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    insertions = []\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(s) - 4:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'A'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'B'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'C'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'D'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'E'))\n        i += 1\n\n    # Sort insertions by index to ensure left-to-right order\n    insertions.sort()\n\n    # Create a new string with insertions\n    result = []\n    last_index = 0\n    for index, char in insertions:\n        result.append(s[last_index:index])\n        result.append(char)\n        last_index = index\n    result.append(s[last_index:])\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"AAABCDBBCDEECDEAD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nnew_string = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nThis code will find all the required substrings, determine where to insert the new characters, and construct the new string accordingly. Let's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"AAABCDABBCDEBECDEACD\". This result is obtained by identifying the specified substrings in the original string and inserting the corresponding characters in the correct order.\n\n<<<AAABCDABBCDEBECDEACD>>>"
