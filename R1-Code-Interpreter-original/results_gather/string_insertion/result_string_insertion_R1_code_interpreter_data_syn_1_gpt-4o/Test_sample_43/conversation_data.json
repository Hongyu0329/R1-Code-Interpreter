    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we iterate through the string.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order of their appearance.\n2. When a substring is found, insert the specified character immediately after it.\n3. Continue the process until the end of the string is reached.\n4. Ensure that the insertions do not affect the detection of subsequent substrings.\n\nTo implement this, we can use a loop to iterate through the string and a list to keep track of the characters, allowing us to insert new characters without affecting the iteration process.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('A')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('B')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('C')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('D')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('E')\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nnew_string = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nThis code will apply the T operation to the given string and print the resulting string. Let's execute it to find the answer.",

The string \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\" was transformed into \"DEABDECDEACADEABDDD\" after one operation T.\n\nThe process involved checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character immediately after each occurrence, while iterating from left to right.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<DEABDECDEACADEABDDD>>>"
