    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEAAEABCCBCDE\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"CDEAAEABCCBCDE\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n6. Look for the substring \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n\nWe will implement this logic in a Python script to ensure accuracy and handle the insertions correctly.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the patterns and their corresponding insertions\n    patterns = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i <= len(s_list) - 4:\n        # Check each pattern\n        for pattern, insert_char in patterns:\n            # If the pattern matches, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(pattern):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no pattern matched\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"CDEAAEABCCBCDE\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result after applying the T operation.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"CDEACAEABCECBCDEB\". \n\nThe process involved checking for each specified substring in the given string and inserting the corresponding character immediately after each occurrence, while ensuring that the insertions are done from left to right.\n\n<<<CDEACAEABCECBCDEB>>>"
