    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEEBCDECABCDDD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we go through the string.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings: ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, or EABC.\n2. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character to find the next occurrence of any of the specified substrings.\n4. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nTo implement this, we can use a loop to iterate through the string and a list to keep track of the characters, allowing us to insert new characters as needed. Let's write a Python script to perform this operation.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('A')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('B')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('C')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('D')\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.extend(s[i:i+4])\n            result.append('E')\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"BCDEEBCDECABCDDD\"\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis script will apply the T operation to the given string and print the resulting string. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"BCDEBEBCDEBCABCDADD\". \n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. The first occurrence of \"BCDE\" is at the start of the string, so we insert 'B' after it, resulting in \"BCDEB\".\n2. We continue scanning and find another \"BCDE\" starting at index 5, so we insert another 'B', resulting in \"BCDEBEBCDEB\".\n3. Next, we find \"ABCD\" starting at index 10, so we insert 'A', resulting in \"BCDEBEBCDEBCABCDDA\".\n4. Finally, we find \"DEAB\" starting at index 13, so we insert 'D', resulting in \"BCDEBEBCDEBCABCDADD\".\n\nThe insertions are done from left to right, and the final string after one T operation is:\n\n<<<BCDEBEBCDEBCABCDADD>>>"
