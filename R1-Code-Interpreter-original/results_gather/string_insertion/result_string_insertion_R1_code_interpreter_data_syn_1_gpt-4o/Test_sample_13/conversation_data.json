    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each identified substring, we insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since the operation is applied from left to right, we need to ensure that the insertions are done in the correct order to avoid affecting subsequent substring searches.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the resulting string after one T operation.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresulting_string = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(resulting_string)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the resulting string. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the resulting string after applying one T operation to the given string \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\" is \"DEABDDDEABDADEABDBA\". \n\nThe process involved checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character immediately after each occurrence, while ensuring the operation was applied from left to right.\n\n<<<DEABDDDEABDADEABDBA>>>"
