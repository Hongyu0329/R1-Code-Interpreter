    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CCDEAACDEACEABCBD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"CCDEAACDEACEABCBD\".\n2. Check for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert 'A' after it.\n3. Check for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert 'B' after it.\n4. Check for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert 'C' after it.\n5. Check for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert 'D' after it.\n6. Check for the substring \"EABC\" and insert 'E' after it.\n\nWe will iterate over the string and apply these rules. Since the insertions are done from left to right, we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we go.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(s) - 4:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"CCDEAACDEACEABCBD\"\nresult = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will apply the T operation to the string and print the resulting string. Let's execute it to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"CCDEACACDEACCEABCEBD\". \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<CCDEACACDEACCEABCEBD>>>"
