    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\".\n2. Check for each of the specified substrings in the order they appear in the string.\n3. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Continue this process from left to right, ensuring that each insertion is accounted for in subsequent checks.\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script that iterates over the string, checks for the substrings, and performs the insertions. We'll use a loop to go through the string and a list to handle the insertions efficiently.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\"\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the resulting string. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"ADEABDEDEABDBEABCEBE\". \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<ADEABDEDEABDBEABCEBE>>>"
