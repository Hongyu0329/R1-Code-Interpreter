    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EABCBABCDCCDEAA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations and how they affect the string as we process it.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings: \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", \"EABC\".\n2. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character.\n4. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script that performs these operations. The script will iterate over the string, check for each substring, and modify the string accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"EABCBABCDCCDEAA\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the result after one T operation.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying one T operation to the given string \"EABCBABCDCCDEAA\" is \"EABCEBABCDACCDEACA\".\n\nThe process involved checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character immediately after each occurrence, moving from left to right through the string.\n\n<<<EABCEBABCDACCDEACA>>>"
