    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we go through the string.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they are defined.\n2. For each substring found, insert the specified character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position after the inserted character to ensure that insertions are done from left to right.\n4. Repeat this process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to find the resulting string after one operation T.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\"\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting string after one operation T.",
