    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDCABCDACDEA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"ABCDCABCDACDEA\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\". If found, insert 'A' after it.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\". If found, insert 'B' after it.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\". If found, insert 'C' after it.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\". If found, insert 'D' after it.\n6. Look for the substring \"EABC\". If found, insert 'E' after it.\n\nWe will perform these operations in the order given, and since the insertions are done from left to right, we need to keep track of the changes to the string as we go.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the newly inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"ABCDCABCDACDEA\"\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nThis script will apply the T operation to the string and print the resulting string. Let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"ABCDACABCDAACDEAC\". \n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. The first occurrence of \"ABCD\" is at the start of the string, so we insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"ABCDACABCDACDEA\".\n2. The next occurrence of \"ABCD\" is now at index 5, so we insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"ABCDACABCDAACDEA\".\n3. The substring \"CDEA\" is found at index 10, so we insert 'C' after it, resulting in \"ABCDACABCDAACDEAC\".\n\nThe operations are performed from left to right, and the final string after one T operation is \"ABCDACABCDAACDEAC\".\n\n<<<ABCDACABCDAACDEAC>>>"
