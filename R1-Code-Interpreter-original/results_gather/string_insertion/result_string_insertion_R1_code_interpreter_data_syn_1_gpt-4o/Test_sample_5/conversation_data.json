    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABBEABCCABCDA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations to ensure that each insertion is based on the original string, not the modified one.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each identified substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since insertions are done from left to right, we should process the string in a single pass, keeping track of the positions where insertions are made.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We will write a Python script to automate this process, ensuring that we correctly handle the order of insertions.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # List to store the positions and characters to insert\n    insertions = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the string to find all substrings\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(s) - 4:\n        for sub, char in operations:\n            if s[i:i+4] == sub:\n                insertions.append((i+4, char))\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Sort insertions by position (though they should already be in order)\n    insertions.sort()\n    \n    # Create a new string with the insertions\n    result = []\n    last_pos = 0\n    for pos, char in insertions:\n        result.append(s[last_pos:pos])\n        result.append(char)\n        last_pos = pos\n    result.append(s[last_pos:])\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"DEABBEABCCABCDA\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(s)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will find all the required substrings in the given string and insert the appropriate characters in the correct order. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"DEABDBEABCECABCDAA\". This result is obtained by following the defined rules for substring detection and character insertion.\n\nLet's break down the output:\n\n1. The substring \"DEAB\" is found at the start of the string, so we insert \"D\" after it, resulting in \"DEABD\".\n2. The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at position 5, so we insert \"E\" after it, resulting in \"DEABDBEABC\".\n3. The substring \"CABC\" is found starting at position 9, so we insert \"A\" after it, resulting in \"DEABDBEABCECABCDAA\".\n\nThe final string after one T operation is \"DEABDBEABCECABCDAA\".\n\n<<<DEABDBEABCECABCDAA>>>"
