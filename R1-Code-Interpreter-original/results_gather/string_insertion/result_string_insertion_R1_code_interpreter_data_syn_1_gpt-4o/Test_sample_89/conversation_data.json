    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AEABCADEABAEABCBD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations and how the string changes as we process it.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings: ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, or EABC.\n2. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character.\n4. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nTo implement this, we can use a loop to iterate over the string and check for each of the substrings. We will use a list to build the new string, as string concatenation in Python can be inefficient.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"AEABCADEABAEABCBD\"\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis code will apply the T operation to the given string and print the resulting string. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"AEABCEADEABDAEABCEBD\". \n\nLet's analyze the result:\n\n- The original string is \"AEABCADEABAEABCBD\".\n- The operation is applied from left to right:\n  - The substring \"DEAB\" is found at index 5, and \"D\" is inserted after it, resulting in \"AEABCADEABDAEABCBD\".\n  - The substring \"EABC\" is found at index 10, and \"E\" is inserted after it, resulting in \"AEABCEADEABDAEABCEBD\".\n\nThe final string after one T operation is \"AEABCEADEABDAEABCEBD\".\n\n<<<AEABCEADEABDAEABCEBD>>>"
