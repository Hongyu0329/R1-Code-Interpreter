    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABEDEABDCDEAEE\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"DEABEDEABDCDEAEE\".\n2. Scan the string from left to right for each of the specified substrings.\n3. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Continue scanning the string, taking into account the changes made by previous insertions.\n\nTo implement this, we can write a Python script that performs these operations. The script will iterate over the string, check for each substring, and insert the appropriate character. We'll use a loop to ensure that we process the string from left to right, updating the index as we go to account for the changes in string length due to insertions.\n\nLet's write the code to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"DEABEDEABDCDEAEE\"\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the result. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"DEABDEDEABDDCDEACEE\". \n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"DEABEDEABDCDEAEE\".\n2. Look for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it. The first occurrence is at index 0, resulting in \"DEABDEDEABDCDEAEE\".\n3. Continue scanning and find the next \"DEAB\" at index 6, insert \"D\" after it, resulting in \"DEABDEDEABDDCDEAEE\".\n4. Next, find \"CDEA\" at index 12, insert \"C\" after it, resulting in \"DEABDEDEABDDCDEACEE\".\n\nThe final string after one T operation is \"DEABDEDEABDDCDEACEE\".\n\n<<<DEABDEDEABDDCDEACEE>>>"
