    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we go through the string.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they are defined.\n2. When a substring is found, insert the specified character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character to ensure that all possible insertions are made in a single pass.\n4. Repeat this process until the end of the string is reached.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the resulting string after one T operation.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresulting_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(resulting_string)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the resulting string after one T operation.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the resulting string after applying one T operation to the given string \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\" is \"CBABCDAADEABDBABCDA\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<CBABCDAADEABDBABCDA>>>"
