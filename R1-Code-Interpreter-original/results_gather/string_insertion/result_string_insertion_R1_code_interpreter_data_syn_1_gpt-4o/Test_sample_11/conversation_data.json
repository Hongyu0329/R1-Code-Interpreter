    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\".\n2. Check for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert 'A' after it.\n3. Check for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert 'B' after it.\n4. Check for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert 'C' after it.\n5. Check for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert 'D' after it.\n6. Check for the substring \"EABC\" and insert 'E' after it.\n\nWe will implement this logic in a Python script to ensure accuracy and efficiency. The script will iterate over the string, apply the rules, and construct the new string.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\ninitial_string = \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\"\nnew_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result of applying the T operation to the given string.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output string after applying the T operation is \"ACDEACADEABDAABCDA\". \n\nNow, let's analyze the result:\n\n- The original string is \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\".\n- The operation was applied from left to right, checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character immediately after each occurrence.\n\nThe final string after one T operation is:\n\n<<<ACDEACADEABDAABCDA>>>"
