    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string \"EABCCCDEAAABCD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation should be performed from left to right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Check for the substring \"ABCD\". If found, insert \"A\" immediately after it.\n3. Check for the substring \"BCDE\". If found, insert \"B\" immediately after it.\n4. Check for the substring \"CDEA\". If found, insert \"C\" immediately after it.\n5. Check for the substring \"DEAB\". If found, insert \"D\" immediately after it.\n6. Check for the substring \"EABC\". If found, insert \"E\" immediately after it.\n7. Perform these checks and insertions from left to right, ensuring that each insertion is considered in subsequent checks.\n8. Return the final string enclosed in <<< >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return f\"<<<{s}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"EABCCCDEAAABCD\"\n# Perform the T operation\nresult = perform_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed string after performing one T operation on the input string."
