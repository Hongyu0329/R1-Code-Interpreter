    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDCCDEADCDEAEB\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the original string.\n2. Search for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" immediately after it.\n3. Search for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" immediately after it.\n4. Search for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" immediately after it.\n5. Search for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" immediately after it.\n6. Search for the substring \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" immediately after it.\n7. Perform these insertions from left to right, ensuring that each insertion does not affect the subsequent searches.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        for pattern, insert_char in operations:\n            # Check if the current slice matches the pattern\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(pattern):\n                # Insert the character after the pattern\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                # Move the index past the newly inserted character\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    result = ''.join(s_list)\n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"ABCDCCDEADCDEAEB\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed string after applying the T operation once, formatted as requested."
