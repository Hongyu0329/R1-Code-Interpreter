    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation should be performed from left to right, meaning that once a character is inserted, it should be considered in subsequent operations.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Search for each of the specified substrings in the order they appear in the rules.\n3. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Continue this process from left to right, ensuring that any changes made are considered in subsequent operations.\n5. Once all possible insertions are made, output the final string in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"ADEABBABCDAEABCBD\"\nresult_string = perform_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will perform the T operation on the given string and print the result in the required format."
