    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string \"EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Search for each of the specified substrings (\"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", \"EABC\") in the string.\n3. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Ensure that insertions are done from left to right to maintain the correct order.\n5. Return the modified string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for sub, insert in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(sub):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no operation was performed\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    result = ''.join(s_list)\n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\"\n# Perform the operation and print the result\nprint(perform_t_operation(input_string))\n```\n\nThis code will output the modified string after performing one T operation, enclosed in <<< and >>>."
