    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation should be applied from left to right, meaning we should process the string in a single pass and make insertions as we find each substring.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Initialize an empty result string to build the final output.\n3. Iterate over the string, checking for each of the specified substrings.\n4. If a substring is found, append it to the result string and insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n5. Continue this process until the end of the string is reached.\n6. Return the final result string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result += \"ABCD\" + \"A\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result += \"BCDE\" + \"B\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result += \"CDEA\" + \"C\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result += \"DEAB\" + \"D\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result += \"EABC\" + \"E\"\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result += s[i]\n            i += 1\n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"CAEABCCEABCCBCDEEE\"\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis code will process the string according to the rules defined and output the modified string in the required format."
