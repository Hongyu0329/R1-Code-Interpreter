    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDCDEADABCDA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Search for each of the specified substrings in the order they appear in the string.\n3. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Continue this process from left to right, ensuring that each insertion is considered in subsequent searches.\n5. Return the final modified string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the newly inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return f\"<<<{s}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DEABDCDEADABCDA\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the modified string after applying the T operation once, enclosed in <<< and >>>.",

    "The current implementation correctly applies the T operation by checking for each specified substring and inserting the corresponding character. The code uses a loop to systematically search through the string, which is appropriate for this task. The complexity analysis indicates that the code is already using a searching approach and symbolic computing effectively. Since the output matches the expected result and the code is functioning as intended, you can proceed with this solution."
