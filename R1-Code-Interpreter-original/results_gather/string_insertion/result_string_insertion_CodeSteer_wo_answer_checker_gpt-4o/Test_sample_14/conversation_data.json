    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEEBCDECABCDDD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings: \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", \"EABC\".\n2. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character to avoid overlapping insertions.\n4. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n5. Return the modified string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return \"<<<\" + \"\".join(result) + \">>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"BCDEEBCDECABCDDD\"\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis code will process the string according to the rules and print the result in the required format.",
    "To optimize the code, we can use Python's built-in string methods to efficiently search for substrings and perform insertions. While the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is excellent for substring searching, in this specific case, the built-in methods are sufficient and more straightforward for our needs.\n\nHere's an optimized approach:\n\n1. Use a loop to iterate over the string while checking for the specified substrings.\n2. Use Python's `str.find()` method to locate the first occurrence of each substring starting from the current position.\n3. Track the minimum index where any of the substrings is found.\n4. Insert the corresponding character immediately after the found substring.\n5. Continue the search from the position right after the inserted character.\n6. Repeat until the end of the string is reached.\n\nLet's implement this optimized approach:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation_optimized(s):\n    insertions = {\n        \"ABCD\": \"A\",\n        \"BCDE\": \"B\",\n        \"CDEA\": \"C\",\n        \"DEAB\": \"D\",\n        \"EABC\": \"E\"\n    }\n    \n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        min_index = len(s)\n        insert_char = ''\n        for sub, char in insertions.items():\n            index = s.find(sub, i)\n            if index != -1 and index < min_index:\n                min_index = index\n                insert_char = char\n        \n        if min_index < len(s):\n            result.append(s[i:min_index + 4])\n            result.append(insert_char)\n            i = min_index + 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i:])\n            break\n    \n    return \"<<<\" + \"\".join(result) + \">>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"BCDEEBCDECABCDDD\"\n# Apply the optimized T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation_optimized(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis code efficiently finds and processes the substrings using `str.find()`, which is optimized for performance in Python. The result is constructed by appending parts of the string and the inserted characters, ensuring that the operation is applied correctly and efficiently."

    "The current implementation correctly applies the T operation by checking for specific substrings and inserting the corresponding characters. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code could be improved by using more efficient searching techniques or symbolic computing. Consider optimizing the code by using advanced string manipulation techniques or data structures that can handle substring searching more efficiently. This could involve using algorithms like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring searching or leveraging Python's built-in functions for more efficient string operations. Try to enhance the code to reduce its complexity and improve performance."
