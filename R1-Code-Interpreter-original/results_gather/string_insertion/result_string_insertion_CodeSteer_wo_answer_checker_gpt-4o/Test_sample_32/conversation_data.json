    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DBCDEBABCDDDEABAB\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings: \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", \"EABC\".\n2. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character to avoid overlapping insertions.\n4. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n5. Return the modified string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return \"<<<\" + \"\".join(result) + \">>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DBCDEBABCDDDEABAB\"\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis code will output the modified string after applying the T operation once, enclosed in <<< and >>>.",
    "To ensure that the insertions are done strictly from left to right without skipping any potential matches, we need to adjust the logic so that after each insertion, the search continues from the next character after the inserted one. This means we should only move one character forward after an insertion, rather than skipping the length of the matched substring.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings: \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", \"EABC\".\n2. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Move the index forward by one character after the insertion to continue checking for other potential matches.\n4. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n5. Return the modified string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 1  # Move one character forward after insertion\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 1\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 1\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 1\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return \"<<<\" + \"\".join(result) + \">>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DBCDEBABCDDDEABAB\"\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that all possible insertions are considered by moving only one character forward after each insertion, thus preventing any potential matches from being skipped."
