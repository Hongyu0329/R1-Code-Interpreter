    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string. The T operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation should be applied from left to right, meaning we should process the string in a single pass and apply the insertions as we find the substrings.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty result string.\n2. Iterate over the input string, checking for each of the specified substrings.\n3. If a substring is found, append the substring and the corresponding character to the result string.\n4. If no substring is found, append the current character to the result string.\n5. Continue this process until the end of the string.\n6. Print the final result string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result += \"ABCD\" + \"A\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result += \"BCDE\" + \"B\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result += \"CDEA\" + \"C\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result += \"DEAB\" + \"D\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result += \"EABC\" + \"E\"\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result += s[i]\n            i += 1\n    return result\n\ninput_string = \"CDDEABBEABCCBCDEDC\"\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\nprint(f\"<<<{output_string}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will process the input string and apply the T operation as described, then print the resulting string enclosed in <<< and >>>.",

    "The current code correctly implements the T operation by checking for specific substrings and inserting the corresponding characters. The complexity analysis indicates that the code uses a systematic search approach and symbolic computing, which is appropriate for this task. The output matches the expected result, so the TaskLLM's solution is correct. You can proceed with this answer."
