    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string \"AADEABEDEABECDEA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we iterate through the string.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty result string.\n2. Iterate through the given string, checking for each of the specified substrings.\n3. If a substring is found, append the substring and the corresponding character to the result string.\n4. If no substring is found, append the current character to the result string.\n5. Continue this process until the end of the string.\n6. Print the final result string enclosed in <<< >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result += \"ABCD\" + \"A\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result += \"BCDE\" + \"B\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result += \"CDEA\" + \"C\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result += \"DEAB\" + \"D\"\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result += \"EABC\" + \"E\"\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result += s[i]\n            i += 1\n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"AADEABEDEABECDEA\"\n# Perform the T operation\noutput_string = perform_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed string after applying the T operation once, enclosed in <<< >>>."
