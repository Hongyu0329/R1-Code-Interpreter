    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The key point is to perform these insertions from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes as we iterate through the string.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Iterate through the string, checking for each of the specified substrings.\n3. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Continue the process from left to right, updating the string as you go.\n5. Return the final string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return f\"<<<{s}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DACDEAADEABEEABCEB\"\n# Perform the T operation\nresult = perform_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the string after performing one T operation, enclosed in <<< and >>>."
