    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Search for each of the specified substrings in the order they are listed.\n3. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Keep track of the changes in the string as you perform each insertion, ensuring that subsequent searches account for the modified string.\n5. Once all insertions are done, output the final string in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for pattern, insert_char in operations:\n            # If the pattern is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(pattern):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                # Move the index forward to avoid re-checking the same pattern\n                i += 4\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no pattern matched, move to the next character\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    result = ''.join(s_list)\n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\"\n# Perform the operation and print the result\nprint(perform_t_operation(input_string))\n```\n\nThis code will output the modified string after performing one T operation, formatted as requested."
