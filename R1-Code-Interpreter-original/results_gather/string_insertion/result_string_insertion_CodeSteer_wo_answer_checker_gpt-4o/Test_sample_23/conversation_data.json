    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The key is to perform these insertions from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we go through it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Initialize an index to traverse the string.\n3. As you traverse the string, check for each of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC).\n4. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n5. Move the index forward, taking into account the newly inserted character, to ensure that insertions are done from left to right.\n6. Continue this process until the end of the string is reached.\n7. Return the modified string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return f\"<<<{s}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the string after applying one T operation, formatted as requested."
