    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we process it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the given string.\n2. Initialize an index to traverse the string.\n3. As you traverse the string, check for each of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC).\n4. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring.\n5. Adjust the index to account for the newly inserted character to ensure that subsequent checks are done correctly.\n6. Continue this process until the end of the string is reached.\n7. Output the final string in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"EAEABCBDEABACDEADB\"\nresult_string = perform_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed string after applying the T operation once, formatted as requested."
