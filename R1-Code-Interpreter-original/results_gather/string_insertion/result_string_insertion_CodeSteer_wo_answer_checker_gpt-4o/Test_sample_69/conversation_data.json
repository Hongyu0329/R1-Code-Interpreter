    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEAECDEAAABCD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The key is to perform these insertions from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we go through it.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the original string.\n2. Iterate through the string, checking for each of the specified substrings.\n3. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n4. Adjust the current position in the string to account for the newly inserted character, ensuring that subsequent checks are made on the updated string.\n5. Continue this process until the end of the string is reached.\n6. Output the final string in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the newly inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\noriginal_string = \"CDEAECDEAAABCD\"\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(original_string)\nprint(f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed string after applying the T operation once, formatted as requested."
