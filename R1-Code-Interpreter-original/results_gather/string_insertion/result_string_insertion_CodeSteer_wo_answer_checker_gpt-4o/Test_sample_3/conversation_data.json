    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the T operation on the given string \"CDEADDEABEEABCE\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start with the original string.\n2. Search for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert 'A' after it.\n3. Search for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert 'B' after it.\n4. Search for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert 'C' after it.\n5. Search for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert 'D' after it.\n6. Search for the substring \"EABC\" and insert 'E' after it.\n7. Perform these insertions from left to right, ensuring that each insertion is based on the original string before any modifications.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for pattern, insert_char in operations:\n            # If the pattern is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(pattern):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no pattern matched\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    result = ''.join(s_list)\n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"CDEADDEABEEABCE\"\n# Perform the operation and print the result\nprint(perform_t_operation(input_string))\n```\n\nThis code will output the modified string after performing one T operation on the given input."
