    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CEABCCABCDCEABCA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings: \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", \"EABC\".\n2. When a substring is found, insert the corresponding character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character to ensure that insertions are done from left to right.\n4. Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached.\n5. Return the modified string enclosed in <<< and >>>.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return f\"<<<{s}>>>\"\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"CEABCCABCDCEABCA\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult = apply_t_operation(input_string)\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the string after applying one T operation, enclosed in <<< and >>>."
