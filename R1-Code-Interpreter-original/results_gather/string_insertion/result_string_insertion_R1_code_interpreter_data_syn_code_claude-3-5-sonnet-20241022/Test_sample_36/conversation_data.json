    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, I need to understand what happens when we apply operation T:\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right\n   - When we find any of the specified substrings, we insert the corresponding character after it\n   - The insertions might affect the positions for subsequent checks\n\n2) For the given string EAABCDCABCDADEAB:\n   - We need to check for all possible substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC)\n   - When we find one, we insert the corresponding character\n   - We need to keep track of the position shifts after each insertion\n\n3) Let me write a code to simulate this operation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_T(s):\n    # Define the patterns and their corresponding insertions\n    patterns = {\n        'ABCD': 'A',\n        'BCDE': 'B',\n        'CDEA': 'C',\n        'DEAB': 'D',\n        'EABC': 'E'\n    }\n    \n    # Convert to list for easier manipulation\n    result = list(s)\n    offset = 0  # Keep track of how many characters we've inserted\n    \n    # Check each position in the original string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Get the substring of length 4 starting at position i\n        if i + 4 <= len(s):\n            substr = s[i:i+4]\n            # Check if this substring matches any pattern\n            if substr in patterns:\n                # Insert the corresponding character at the correct position\n                result.insert(i + 4 + offset, patterns[substr])\n                offset += 1\n    \n    # Convert back to string and return\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Test with the given string\ns = \"EAABCDCABCDADEAB\"\nresult = apply_T(s)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n4) Let's analyze what happens:\n   - Starting from left, we scan the string EAABCDCABCDADEAB\n   - We find \"ABCD\" first at position 2 → insert 'A'\n   - Then we find \"ABCD\" again at position 7 → insert 'A'\n   - Finally, we find \"DEAB\" at position 11 → insert 'D'\n\n5) The code has given us the result after applying operation T once.\n\n<<<EAABCDACABCDAADEABD>>>",
    "The code execution matches my analysis. Let me verify the answer is correct:\n\n1) Let's check the transformations step by step:\n   - Original string: EAABCDCABCDADEAB\n   - First \"ABCD\" found at position 2 (EAABCDCABCDADEAB)\n     → Insert 'A' after it: EAABCDACABCDADEAB\n   - Second \"ABCD\" found at position 7 (EAABCDACABCDADEAB)\n     → Insert 'A' after it: EAABCDACABCDAADEAB\n   - \"DEAB\" found at position 11 (EAABCDACABCDAADEAB)\n     → Insert 'D' after it: EAABCDACABCDAADEABD\n\n2) The result is correct because:\n   - We processed from left to right\n   - Each insertion was made after finding a valid substring\n   - No other valid substrings (BCDE, CDEA, EABC) were found\n   - The insertions were made in the correct order and positions\n\nTherefore, I can confirm the answer:\n\n<<<EAABCDACABCDAADEABD>>>"
