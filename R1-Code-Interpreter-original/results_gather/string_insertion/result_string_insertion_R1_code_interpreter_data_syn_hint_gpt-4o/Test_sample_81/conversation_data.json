    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n6. Look for the substring \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n\nWe will perform these operations in the order they appear in the string, from left to right. Let's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\ninitial_string = \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\"\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting string after one T operation.",
    "The code execution result shows that the string after one T operation is \"CBCDEBCABCDAACDEAC\". This result is consistent with the rules of the T operation applied to the initial string \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\". \n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. The initial string is \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\".\n2. The first substring \"BCDE\" is found at index 1, so we insert \"B\" after it, resulting in \"CBCDEBCABCDACDEA\".\n3. The next substring \"ABCD\" is found at index 7, so we insert \"A\" after it, resulting in \"CBCDEBCABCDAACDEA\".\n4. The next substring \"CDEA\" is found at index 11, so we insert \"C\" after it, resulting in \"CBCDEBCABCDAACDEAC\".\n\nThe operations are performed from left to right, and the final string after one T operation is \"CBCDEBCABCDAACDEAC\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<CBCDEBCABCDAACDEAC>>>"
