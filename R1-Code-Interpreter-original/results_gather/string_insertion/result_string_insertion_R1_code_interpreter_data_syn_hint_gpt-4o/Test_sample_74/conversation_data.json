    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each identified substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since insertions are done from left to right, we need to ensure that the string is updated progressively as we find and insert characters.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the resulting string after one T operation.\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i <= len(s_list) - 4:\n        # Check each operation\n        for sub, insert in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(sub):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert)\n                # Move the index forward to avoid re-checking the same substring\n                i += 4\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no operation was performed, move to the next character\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresulting_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(resulting_string)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the resulting string after one T operation.",
    "The code execution result shows that the string after one T operation is \"CBABCDAADEABDBABCDA\". This result is obtained by applying the defined operations in sequence from left to right, ensuring that each substring match is processed before moving on to the next part of the string.\n\nLet's verify the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\"\n\n2. **Substrings and Insertions**:\n   - \"ABCD\" -> Insert \"A\" after \"ABCD\"\n   - \"BCDE\" -> Insert \"B\" after \"BCDE\"\n   - \"CDEA\" -> Insert \"C\" after \"CDEA\"\n   - \"DEAB\" -> Insert \"D\" after \"DEAB\"\n   - \"EABC\" -> Insert \"E\" after \"EABC\"\n\n3. **Process**:\n   - Find \"ABCD\" at index 4, insert \"A\" after it: \"CBABCDAADEABBABCD\"\n   - Find \"DEAB\" at index 8, insert \"D\" after it: \"CBABCDAADEABDBABCD\"\n\nThe resulting string after applying the T operation is \"CBABCDAADEABDBABCDA\".\n\nThis matches the code output, confirming that the operation was applied correctly.\n\n<<<\"CBABCDAADEABDBABCDA\">>>"
