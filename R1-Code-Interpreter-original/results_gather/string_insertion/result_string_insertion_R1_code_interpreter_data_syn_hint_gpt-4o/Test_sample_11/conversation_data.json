    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\".\n2. Check for the substring \"ABCD\". If found, insert 'A' after it.\n3. Check for the substring \"BCDE\". If found, insert 'B' after it.\n4. Check for the substring \"CDEA\". If found, insert 'C' after it.\n5. Check for the substring \"DEAB\". If found, insert 'D' after it.\n6. Check for the substring \"EABC\". If found, insert 'E' after it.\n\nWe will iterate through the string and apply these rules. Since the operation is applied from left to right, we need to be careful with the indices as the string changes.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the resulting string after one operation T.\n\n```python\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(s) - 4:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\nresult = apply_T_operation(\"ACDEAADEABAABCD\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting string.",
    "The code execution result shows that the string after one operation T is \"ACDEACADEABDAABCDA\". This result is consistent with the rules of the T operation applied from left to right. \n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\".\n2. Identify the substrings and apply the insertions:\n   - \"CDEA\" is found at index 1, insert 'C' after it: \"ACDEACADEABAABCD\".\n   - \"DEAB\" is found at index 7, insert 'D' after it: \"ACDEACADEABDAABCD\".\n   - \"ABCD\" is found at index 12, insert 'A' after it: \"ACDEACADEABDAABCDA\".\n\nThe final string after applying the T operation once is \"ACDEACADEABDAABCDA\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<ACDEACADEABDAABCDA>>>"
