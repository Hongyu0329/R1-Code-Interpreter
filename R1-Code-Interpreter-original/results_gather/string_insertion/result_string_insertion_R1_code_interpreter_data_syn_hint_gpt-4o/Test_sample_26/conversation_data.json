    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\". If found, insert \"A\" after it.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\". If found, insert \"B\" after it.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\". If found, insert \"C\" after it.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\". If found, insert \"D\" after it.\n6. Look for the substring \"EABC\". If found, insert \"E\" after it.\n\nWe will iterate through the string and apply these rules. Let's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\"\n# Apply the T operation\nnew_string = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nThis script will apply the T operation to the string and print the resulting string. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the T operation was applied correctly, and the resulting string is \"DDEABDEEABCEAABCDAAA\". \n\nLet's verify the process step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the operation:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\".\n2. Apply the T operation from left to right:\n   - The first occurrence of \"DEAB\" is at index 1, so we insert \"D\" after it, resulting in \"DDEABDEEABCAABCDAA\".\n   - The next occurrence of \"EABC\" is at index 6, so we insert \"E\" after it, resulting in \"DDEABDEEABCEAABCDAA\".\n   - The next occurrence of \"ABCD\" is at index 12, so we insert \"A\" after it, resulting in \"DDEABDEEABCEAABCDAAA\".\n\nThe final string after applying the T operation is \"DDEABDEEABCEAABCDAAA\".\n\nSince the code execution result matches our manual verification, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<<<\"DDEABDEEABCEAABCDAAA\">>>"
