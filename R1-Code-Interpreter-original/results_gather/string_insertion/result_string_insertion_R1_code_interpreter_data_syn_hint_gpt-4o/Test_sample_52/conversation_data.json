    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they are defined.\n2. For each occurrence of a substring, insert the specified character immediately after it.\n3. Continue scanning the string from left to right, taking into account any changes made by previous insertions.\n\nGiven the string \"BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\", let's apply the T operation:\n\n- The first substring to check is \"ABCD\", but it does not appear in the string.\n- The next substring is \"BCDE\", which appears starting at index 1. According to the rule, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\", resulting in \"BBCDEB\".\n- Continue scanning the string. The next substring to check is \"CDEA\", which does not appear.\n- The next substring is \"DEAB\", which appears starting at index 8. According to the rule, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"DEABD\".\n- Continue scanning the string. The next substring is \"EABC\", which does not appear.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\ns = \"BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\"\nresult = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the string after applying the T operation is \"BBCDEBBDEABDADEABDBA\". This result is consistent with the logic we applied, where we inserted characters after specific substrings according to the rules.\n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 1, and we insert 'B' after it, resulting in \"BBCDEB\".\n2. The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 8, and we insert 'D' after it, resulting in \"DEABD\".\n3. The rest of the string does not contain any of the specified substrings, so no further insertions are made.\n\nThe final string after one T operation is \"BBCDEBBDEABDADEABDBA\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<BBCDEBBDEABDADEABDBA>>>"
