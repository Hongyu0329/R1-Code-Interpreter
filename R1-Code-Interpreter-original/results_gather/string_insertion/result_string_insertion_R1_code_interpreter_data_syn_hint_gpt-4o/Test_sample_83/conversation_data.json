    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACDEAEBCDECCDEA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to look for the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Perform Insertions**: For each identified substring, insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done in the order they appear from left to right in the string.\n\n3. **Update the String**: After each insertion, the string changes, and we need to continue checking the rest of the string for more substrings.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to ensure we correctly apply the T operation:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s) - 3:\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"A\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"B\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"C\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"D\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            s = s[:i+4] + \"E\" + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return s\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"ACDEAEBCDECCDEA\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the T operation on the given string and print the resulting string. Let's see the output.",
    "The code execution result shows that the T operation was applied correctly, and the resulting string is \"ACDEACEBCDEBCCDEAC\". This result is obtained by following the rules of the T operation and performing the insertions from left to right.\n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"ACDEAEBCDECCDEA\"\n\n2. **Substrings and Insertions**:\n   - \"BCDE\" is found at index 6, insert \"B\" after it: \"ACDEAEBCDEBCCEDEA\"\n   - \"CDEA\" is found at index 10, insert \"C\" after it: \"ACDEAEBCDEBCCDEAC\"\n\n3. **Final String**: \"ACDEACEBCDEBCCDEAC\"\n\nThe code correctly identifies the substrings and performs the insertions in the correct order. Therefore, the final result of applying the T operation to the given string is:\n\n<<<\"ACDEACEBCDEBCCDEAC\">>>"
