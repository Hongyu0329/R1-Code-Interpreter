    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAABCDCABCDADEAB\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"EAABCDCABCDADEAB\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\". If found, insert 'A' after it.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\". If found, insert 'B' after it.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\". If found, insert 'C' after it.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\". If found, insert 'D' after it.\n6. Look for the substring \"EABC\". If found, insert 'E' after it.\n\nWe will perform these operations in the order they are listed, and since the insertions are done from left to right, we need to keep track of the changes to the string as we go.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the operations as a list of tuples (substring, character to insert)\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for sub, char in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(sub):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, char)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break  # Break to start checking from the new position\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no operation was performed\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"EAABCDCABCDADEAB\"\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result after one T operation.",
    "The code execution result shows that the string after one T operation is \"EAABCDACABCDAADEABD\". This result is consistent with the logic of the T operation as described. Let's verify the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial string: \"EAABCDCABCDADEAB\".\n2. Check for \"ABCD\" and insert 'A' after it:\n   - \"EAABCD\" becomes \"EAABCDAC\".\n3. Check for \"BCDE\" and insert 'B' after it:\n   - No \"BCDE\" is found in the string.\n4. Check for \"CDEA\" and insert 'C' after it:\n   - No \"CDEA\" is found in the string.\n5. Check for \"DEAB\" and insert 'D' after it:\n   - \"DEAB\" becomes \"DEABD\".\n6. Check for \"EABC\" and insert 'E' after it:\n   - No \"EABC\" is found in the string.\n\nThe final string after applying the T operation is \"EAABCDACABCDAADEABD\".\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<EAABCDACABCDAADEABD>>>"
