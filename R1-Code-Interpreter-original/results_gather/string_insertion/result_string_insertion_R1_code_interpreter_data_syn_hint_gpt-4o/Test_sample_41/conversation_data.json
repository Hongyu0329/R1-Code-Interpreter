    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABADEABDCDEADD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"DEABADEABDCDEADD\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\". There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\". There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\". There is no \"CDEA\" in the string.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\". There are two occurrences of \"DEAB\":\n   - The first occurrence is at index 0: \"DEAB\" in \"DEABADEABDCDEADD\".\n   - The second occurrence is at index 5: \"DEAB\" in \"DEABADEABDCDEADD\".\n6. For each occurrence of \"DEAB\", insert \"D\" after it.\n7. Look for the substring \"EABC\". There is no \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions:\n\n- For the first \"DEAB\" at index 0, insert \"D\" after it, resulting in \"DEABDABADEABDCDEADD\".\n- For the second \"DEAB\" at index 5 (which is now at index 9 after the first insertion), insert \"D\" after it, resulting in \"DEABDABADEABDDCDEADD\".\n\nThe final string after one operation T is \"DEABDABADEABDDCDEADD\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<DEABDABADEABDDCDEADD>>>"
