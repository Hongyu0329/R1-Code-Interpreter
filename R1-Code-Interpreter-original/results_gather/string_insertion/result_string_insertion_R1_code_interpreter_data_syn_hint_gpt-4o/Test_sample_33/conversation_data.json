    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABEEABCADEAB\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"DEABEEABCADEAB\".\n2. Check for the substring \"ABCD\". There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n3. Check for the substring \"BCDE\". There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n4. Check for the substring \"CDEA\". There is no \"CDEA\" in the string.\n5. Check for the substring \"DEAB\". There are two occurrences of \"DEAB\":\n   - The first occurrence is at the start of the string: \"DEABEEABCADEAB\".\n   - The second occurrence is at the end of the string: \"DEABEEABCADEAB\".\n6. For each occurrence of \"DEAB\", insert the character 'D' immediately after it.\n\nLet's apply these insertions:\n\n- After the first \"DEAB\", insert 'D': \"DEABDEEABCADEAB\".\n- After the second \"DEAB\", insert 'D': \"DEABDEEABCADEABD\".\n\nNow, let's check for the substring \"EABC\". There is one occurrence of \"EABC\":\n- The occurrence is in the middle of the string: \"DEABDEEABCADEABD\".\n\nFor this occurrence of \"EABC\", insert the character 'E' immediately after it:\n\n- After \"EABC\", insert 'E': \"DEABDEEABCADEABED\".\n\nNow, the string after one operation T is \"DEABDEEABCADEABED\".\n\nTherefore, the final string after applying one operation T is:\n\n<<<DEABDEEABCADEABED>>>"
