    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDCABCDACDEA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is performed from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"ABCDCABCDACDEA\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\". The first occurrence is at the start of the string (index 0). According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after this substring. The string becomes \"ABCDACDCABCDACDEA\".\n3. Continue from where we left off, which is right after the first \"ABCD\" (index 4). The next occurrence of \"ABCD\" is at index 6. Insert 'A' after this substring. The string becomes \"ABCDACDCAABCDACDEA\".\n4. Continue from index 10. The next substring to check is \"CDEA\" at index 10. According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after this substring. The string becomes \"ABCDACDCAABCDACDEAC\".\n5. There are no more substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", or \"EABC\" left in the string.\n\nThe final string after one operation T is \"ABCDACDCAABCDACDEAC\".\n\n<<<ABCDACDCAABCDACDEAC>>>"
