    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\".\n2. Look for the substring \"ABCD\". If found, insert 'A' after it.\n3. Look for the substring \"BCDE\". If found, insert 'B' after it.\n4. Look for the substring \"CDEA\". If found, insert 'C' after it.\n5. Look for the substring \"DEAB\". If found, insert 'D' after it.\n6. Look for the substring \"EABC\". If found, insert 'E' after it.\n\nWe will iterate through the string and apply these rules. Let's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    i = 0\n    result = []\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ns = \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\"\n# Apply the T operation\nnew_string = apply_t_operation(s)\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nThis code will apply the T operation to the string and print the resulting string. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution result seems to be correct, and it matches the expected behavior of the T operation as described. Let's verify the steps to ensure the correctness:\n\n1. Start with the string: \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\".\n2. Apply the T operation from left to right:\n   - \"ABCD\" is found at the start, so insert 'A' after it: \"ABCDADCDEAEDEABD\".\n   - \"BCDE\" is not found.\n   - \"CDEA\" is found, so insert 'C' after it: \"ABCDADCDEACEDEABD\".\n   - \"DEAB\" is found, so insert 'D' after it: \"ABCDADCDEACEDEABDD\".\n   - \"EABC\" is not found.\n\nThe final string after applying the T operation is \"ABCDADCDEACEDEABDD\".\n\nSince the code execution result matches the expected output, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<<<\"ABCDADCDEACEDEABDD\">>>"
