    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBCDEECDEAACDEA\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BBCDEECDEAACDEA\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - The first occurrence is at index 1 (BBCDE). Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n   - The string becomes: BBBCDEEECDEAACDEA\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - The first occurrence is at index 8 (CDEA). Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n   - The string becomes: BBBCDEEECDEACDAACDEA\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is no \"DEAB\" in the string, so no insertion of 'D'.\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is no \"EABC\" in the string, so no insertion of 'E'.\n\nNow, let's implement this in code to ensure accuracy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Initialize the result string\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check for each substring and apply the corresponding operation\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            result.append(\"ABCD\")\n            result.append(\"A\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            result.append(\"BCDE\")\n            result.append(\"B\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(\"CDEA\")\n            result.append(\"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(\"DEAB\")\n            result.append(\"D\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            result.append(\"EABC\")\n            result.append(\"E\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"BBCDEECDEAACDEA\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\nformatted_output = f\"<<<{output_string}>>>\"\nformatted_output\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"BBCDEECDEAACDEA\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<BBCDEBECDEACACDEAC>>>} \\]"
