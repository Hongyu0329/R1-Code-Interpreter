    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEEABCCCDEAEBCDE\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: There is one occurrence of \"BCDE\" starting at index 12. We insert 'B' after this substring.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: There is one occurrence of \"CDEA\" starting at index 7. We insert 'C' after this substring.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 1. We insert 'D' after this substring.\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 9. We insert 'E' after this substring.\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions in order from left to right.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"DEEABCCCDEAEBCDE\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\n# We will keep track of the positions where insertions are made to adjust subsequent insertions\ninsertions = []\n\n# Check for \"DEAB\" and insert 'D'\nindex = initial_string.find(\"DEAB\")\nif index != -1:\n    insertions.append((index + 4, 'D'))\n\n# Check for \"CDEA\" and insert 'C'\nindex = initial_string.find(\"CDEA\")\nif index != -1:\n    insertions.append((index + 4, 'C'))\n\n# Check for \"EABC\" and insert 'E'\nindex = initial_string.find(\"EABC\")\nif index != -1:\n    insertions.append((index + 4, 'E'))\n\n# Check for \"BCDE\" and insert 'B'\nindex = initial_string.find(\"BCDE\")\nif index != -1:\n    insertions.append((index + 4, 'B'))\n\n# Sort insertions by position\ninsertions.sort()\n\n# Apply insertions from left to right\nresult = list(initial_string)\noffset = 0\nfor pos, char in insertions:\n    result.insert(pos + offset, char)\n    offset += 1\n\n# Convert list back to string\nresult_string = ''.join(result)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DEEABCCCDEAEBCDE\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<DEEABCECCDEACEBCDEB>>>} \\]"
