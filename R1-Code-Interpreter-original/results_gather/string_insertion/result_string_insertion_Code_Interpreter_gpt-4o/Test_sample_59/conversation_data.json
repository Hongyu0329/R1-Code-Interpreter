    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: There is no \"CDEA\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 2. We insert \"D\" after this substring.\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 12. We insert \"E\" after this substring.\n\nLet's perform these insertions and see the resulting string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\"\n\n# Perform the T operation\n# Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\"\nindex_deab = initial_string.find(\"DEAB\")\nif index_deab != -1:\n    initial_string = initial_string[:index_deab + 4] + \"D\" + initial_string[index_deab + 4:]\n\n# Insert 'E' after \"EABC\"\nindex_eabc = initial_string.find(\"EABC\")\nif index_eabc != -1:\n    initial_string = initial_string[:index_eabc + 4] + \"E\" + initial_string[index_eabc + 4:]\n\n# Format the result\nresult = f\"<<<{initial_string}>>>\"\nresult\nassistant > After applying one T operation to the string \"ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<ADEABDEDEABBEABCEBE>>>} \\]"
