    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABAEABCADEABED\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each occurrence of a substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since the operation is applied from left to right, we need to ensure that the insertions are done in the correct order, which may affect subsequent matches.\n\nLet's apply this operation to the given string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize the result string and index\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    \n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, char_to_insert in operations:\n            if s[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:\n                # Append the substring and the character to insert\n                result.append(substring + char_to_insert)\n                # Move the index past the substring\n                i += len(substring)\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no operation was applied, just append the current character\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"ADEABAEABCADEABED\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\nformatted_output = f\"<<<{output_string}>>>\"\nformatted_output\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"ADEABAEABCADEABED\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<ADEABDAEABCEADEABDED>>>}\n\\]"
