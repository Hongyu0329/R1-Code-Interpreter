    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**:\n   - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 10. Insert 'A' after it.\n   - Resulting String: DDEABEEABCAABCD**A**AA\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is not present in the string.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is not present in the string.\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 1. Insert 'D' after it.\n   - Resulting String: DDEAB**D**EEABCAABCD**A**AA\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 6. Insert 'E' after it.\n   - Resulting String: DDEAB**D**EEABC**E**AABCD**A**AA\n\nNow, let's format the final string with the required format <<<a string>>>.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\r\ninitial_string = \"DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\"\r\n\r\n# Apply the T operation\r\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\r\n    # Resulting string after applying the T operation\r\n    result = list(s)\r\n    \r\n    # Indices where insertions will be made\r\n    insertions = []\r\n    \r\n    # Check for each substring and determine where to insert\r\n    for i in range(len(s) - 3):\r\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\r\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'A'))\r\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\r\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'B'))\r\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\r\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'C'))\r\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\r\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'D'))\r\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\r\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'E'))\r\n    \r\n    # Insert characters from left to right\r\n    offset = 0\r\n    for index, char in sorted(insertions):\r\n        result.insert(index + offset, char)\r\n        offset += 1\r\n    \r\n    return ''.join(result)\r\n\r\n# Apply the operation and format the result\r\nresulting_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\r\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{resulting_string}>>>\"\r\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DDEABEEABCAABCDAA\", the resulting string is formatted as:\n\n\\[\n\\texttt{<<<DDEABDEEABCEAABCDAAA>>>}\n\\]"
