    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each occurrence of a substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since insertions are done from left to right, we need to keep track of the positions where insertions are made and adjust subsequent insertions accordingly.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and corresponding characters to insert\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, char_to_insert in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, char_to_insert)\n                # Move the index past the inserted character\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\", the resulting string is formatted as:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<DEABDECDEACADEABDDD>>>} \\]"
