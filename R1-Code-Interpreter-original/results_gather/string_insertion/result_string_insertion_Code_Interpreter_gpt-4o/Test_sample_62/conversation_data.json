    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEACBCDECEABCAA\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: CDEACBCDECEABCAA\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"BCDE\" starting at index 5. After \"BCDE\", insert \"B\".\n   - New String: CDEACBCDEBCEABCAA\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"CDEA\" starting at index 0. After \"CDEA\", insert \"C\".\n   - New String: CDEACBCDEBCEABCAA\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 9. After \"DEAB\", insert \"D\".\n   - New String: CDEACBCDEBCEABDAA\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 10. After \"EABC\", insert \"E\".\n   - New String: CDEACBCDEBCEABDEAA\n\nNow, let's implement this in code to ensure accuracy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, insert_char in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                # Move the index forward to avoid overlapping insertions\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"CDEACBCDECEABCAA\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(initial_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"CDEACBCDECEABCAA\", the resulting string is formatted as:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<CDEACCBCDEBCEABCEAA>>>} \\]"
