    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDECCDEAACDEA\" according to the rules specified. We will check for each of the specified substrings in the order they appear in the string and perform the corresponding insertion. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n1. **BCDE**: The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after this substring. The string becomes \"BCDEBCCEDEAACDEA\".\n\n2. **CDEA**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 7 (after the first insertion). According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after this substring. The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDEACCEAACDEA\".\n\n3. **CDEA**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found again starting at index 11 (after the second insertion). According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after this substring. The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDEACCEACDEA\".\n\nNow, let's implement this in code to ensure the correct result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the rules for the T operation\n    rules = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string and apply the rules\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        for pattern, insert_char in rules:\n            # Check if the pattern matches the current position\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(pattern):\n                # Insert the character after the pattern\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                # Move the index past the inserted character\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"BCDECCDEAACDEA\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"BCDECCDEAACDEA\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<BCDEBCCDEACACDEAC>>>} \\]"
