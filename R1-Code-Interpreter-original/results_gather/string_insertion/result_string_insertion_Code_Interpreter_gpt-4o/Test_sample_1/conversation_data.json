    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DBCDEBBCDECABCDC\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: The substring \"BCDE\" appears starting at index 2. We insert 'B' after this substring, resulting in \"DBCDEB\".\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: The substring \"CDEA\" appears starting at index 3. We insert 'C' after this substring, resulting in \"DBCDEBC\".\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: There is no \"DEAB\" in the string, so no insertion of 'D'.\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: There is no \"EABC\" in the string, so no insertion of 'E'.\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions to the string and see the result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, insert_char in operations:\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                # Insert the character after the substring\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                # Move the index forward to avoid overlapping insertions\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DBCDEBBCDECABCDC\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\nresult_string = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nresult_string\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DBCDEBBCDECABCDC\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<DBCDEBBBCDEBCABCDAC>>>} \\]"
