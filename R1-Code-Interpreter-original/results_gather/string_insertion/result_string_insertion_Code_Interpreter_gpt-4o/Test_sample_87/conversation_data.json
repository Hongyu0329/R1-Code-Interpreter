    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADABCDCCDEADABCD\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n1. **Initial String**: ADABCDCCDEADABCD\n\n2. **Check for Substrings**:\n   - **ABCD**: Found at index 3. Insert 'A' after it.\n   - **BCDE**: Not found.\n   - **CDEA**: Not found.\n   - **DEAB**: Not found.\n   - **EABC**: Not found.\n\n3. **Perform Insertion**:\n   - After finding \"ABCD\" at index 3, insert 'A' after it. The string becomes: ADABCDACCCDEADABCD\n\nNow, let's format the final string with the required format <<<a string>>>.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"ADABCDCCDEADABCD\"\n\n# Perform the T operation\n# Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\"\nindex = initial_string.find(\"ABCD\")\nif index != -1:\n    result_string = initial_string[:index + 4] + 'A' + initial_string[index + 4:]\nelse:\n    result_string = initial_string\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying one T operation to the string \"ADABCDCCDEADABCD\", the resulting string is formatted as: <<<ADABCDACCDEADABCD>>>."
