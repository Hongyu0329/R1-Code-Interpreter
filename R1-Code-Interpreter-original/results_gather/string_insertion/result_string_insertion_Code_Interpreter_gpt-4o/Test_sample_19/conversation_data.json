    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEEEABCCEABCC\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BCDEEEABCCEABCC\n\n2. **Check for Substrings and Insert Characters**:\n   - Look for \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n   - Look for \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n   - Look for \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n   - Look for \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n   - Look for \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n\n3. **Apply the Operation**:\n   - Start from the left and find the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings.\n   - Insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring.\n   - Continue to the right and repeat the process until the end of the string.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step to the given string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, char_to_insert in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, char_to_insert)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no operation was performed\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"BCDEEEABCCEABCC\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(initial_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"BCDEEEABCCEABCC\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<BCDEBEEABCECEABCEC>>>}\n\\]"
