    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDDEABBEABCCBCDEDC\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: CDDEABBEABCCBCDEDC\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"BCDE\" starting at index 12. We insert 'B' after this substring.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"CDEA\" in the string.\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 2. We insert 'D' after this substring.\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 6. We insert 'E' after this substring.\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions to the string in the order they appear from left to right.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"CDDEABBEABCCBCDEDC\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\n# Insertions to be made: (index, character)\ninsertions = []\n\n# Check for \"DEAB\" and insert 'D'\nindex = initial_string.find(\"DEAB\")\nif index != -1:\n    insertions.append((index + 4, 'D'))\n\n# Check for \"EABC\" and insert 'E'\nindex = initial_string.find(\"EABC\")\nif index != -1:\n    insertions.append((index + 4, 'E'))\n\n# Check for \"BCDE\" and insert 'B'\nindex = initial_string.find(\"BCDE\")\nif index != -1:\n    insertions.append((index + 4, 'B'))\n\n# Sort insertions by index to ensure left-to-right insertion\ninsertions.sort()\n\n# Apply insertions\nresult_string = list(initial_string)\noffset = 0\nfor index, char in insertions:\n    result_string.insert(index + offset, char)\n    offset += 1\n\n# Convert list back to string\nresult_string = ''.join(result_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying one operation T to the string \"CDDEABBEABCCBCDEDC\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<CDDEABDBEABCECBCDEBDC>>>}\n\\]"
