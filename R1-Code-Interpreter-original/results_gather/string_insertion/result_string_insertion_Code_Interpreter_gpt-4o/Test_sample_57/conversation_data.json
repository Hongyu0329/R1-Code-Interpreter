    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AEABCBEABCBEABCE\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: AEABCBEABCBEABCE\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion of 'B'.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is no \"CDEA\" in the string, so no insertion of 'C'.\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is no \"DEAB\" in the string, so no insertion of 'D'.\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There are two occurrences of \"EABC\" in the string:\n     - The first occurrence is at index 1: \"EABC\" (insert 'E' after this).\n     - The second occurrence is at index 7: \"EABC\" (insert 'E' after this).\n\nLet's perform these insertions from left to right:\n\n- After the first insertion (after the first \"EABC\"), the string becomes: AEABCEBEABCBEABCE\n- After the second insertion (after the second \"EABC\"), the string becomes: AEABCEBEABCEBEABCE\n\nThus, after one operation T, the string becomes \"AEABCEBEABCEBEABCE\".\n\nThe final answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<AEABCEBEABCEBEABCE>>>"
