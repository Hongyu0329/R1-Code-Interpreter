    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCCDEAAEABCCCDEAD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be performed from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BCCDEAAEABCCCDEAD\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"BCDE\" starting at index 1. Insert 'B' after this substring.\n   - New String: BCCDEBAAEABCCCDEAD\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"CDEA\" starting at index 11. Insert 'C' after this substring.\n   - New String: BCCDEBAAEABCCCDEACD\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 7. Insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - New String: BCCDEBAAEABCDCCDEACD\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 8. Insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - New String: BCCDEBAAEABCECDCCDEACD\n\nNow, let's implement this step-by-step process in code to ensure accuracy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and corresponding characters to insert\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, char_to_insert in operations:\n            # Check if the substring is found at the current position\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                # Insert the character after the substring\n                s_list.insert(i+4, char_to_insert)\n                # Move the index forward to avoid overlapping insertions\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"BCCDEAAEABCCCDEAD\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(initial_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"BCCDEAAEABCCCDEAD\", the resulting string is formatted as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<BCCDEACAEABCECCDEACD>>>}\n\\]"
