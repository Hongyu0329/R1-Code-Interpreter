    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AEABCADEABAEABCBD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation is applied from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n1. **Initial String**: AEABCADEABAEABCBD\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion of 'B'.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is no \"CDEA\" in the string, so no insertion of 'C'.\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 6. Insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - New string: AEABCADEABDAEABCBD\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 10. Insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - New string: AEABCADEABDAEABECBD\n\nAfter applying the T operation from left to right, the resulting string is \"AEABCADEABDAEABECBD\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<AEABCADEABDAEABECBD>>>"
