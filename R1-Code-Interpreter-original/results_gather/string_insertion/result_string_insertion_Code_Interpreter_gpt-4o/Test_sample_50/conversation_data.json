    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EBCDEEEABCCBCDE\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be performed from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: EBCDEEEABCCBCDE\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 1. Insert 'B' after it.\n   - New string: EBCDEBEEABCCBCDE\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is no \"CDEA\" in the string, so no insertion of 'C'.\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is no \"DEAB\" in the string, so no insertion of 'D'.\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 6. Insert 'E' after it.\n   - New string: EBCDEBEEABCECCBCDE\n\nNow, let's format the final string with the required format <<<a string>>>.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\r\ninitial_string = \"EBCDEEEABCCBCDE\"\r\n\r\n# Apply the T operation\r\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\r\n    # Convert string to list for easier manipulation\r\n    s_list = list(s)\r\n    i = 0\r\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\r\n        # Check for each substring and insert the corresponding character\r\n        if s_list[i:i+4] == list(\"ABCD\"):\r\n            s_list.insert(i+4, 'A')\r\n            i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\r\n        elif s_list[i:i+4] == list(\"BCDE\"):\r\n            s_list.insert(i+4, 'B')\r\n            i += 5\r\n        elif s_list[i:i+4] == list(\"CDEA\"):\r\n            s_list.insert(i+4, 'C')\r\n            i += 5\r\n        elif s_list[i:i+4] == list(\"DEAB\"):\r\n            s_list.insert(i+4, 'D')\r\n            i += 5\r\n        elif s_list[i:i+4] == list(\"EABC\"):\r\n            s_list.insert(i+4, 'E')\r\n            i += 5\r\n        else:\r\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character\r\n    return ''.join(s_list)\r\n\r\n# Apply the operation\r\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\r\n\r\n# Format the result\r\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\r\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying one T operation to the string \"EBCDEEEABCCBCDE\", the resulting string is formatted as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<EBCDEBEEABCECBCDEB>>>}\n\\]"
