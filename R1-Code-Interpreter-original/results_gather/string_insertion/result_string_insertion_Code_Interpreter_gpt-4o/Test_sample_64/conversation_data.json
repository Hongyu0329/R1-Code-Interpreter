    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDCCDEADCDEAEB\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n1. **ABCD**: Insert 'A' after this substring.\n2. **BCDE**: Insert 'B' after this substring.\n3. **CDEA**: Insert 'C' after this substring.\n4. **DEAB**: Insert 'D' after this substring.\n5. **EABC**: Insert 'E' after this substring.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the string \"ABCDCCDEADCDEAEB\".
