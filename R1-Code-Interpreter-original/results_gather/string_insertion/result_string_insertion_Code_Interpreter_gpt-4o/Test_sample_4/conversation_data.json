    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDABCDADEAB\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: \n   - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 5. We insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"DEABDAABCDADEAB\".\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"CDEA\" in the string.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: \n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 0. We insert 'D' after it, resulting in \"DEABDABCDADEAB\".\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nNow, let's apply these operations to the string and see the result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Apply the operations from left to right\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        for substring, char_to_insert in operations:\n            if s[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:\n                s = s[:i+len(substring)] + char_to_insert + s[i+len(substring):]\n                i += len(substring)  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    return s\n\n# Given string\ninitial_string = \"DEABDABCDADEAB\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(initial_string)\nresult_string_formatted = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nresult_string_formatted\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DEABDABCDADEAB\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<DEABDDABCDAADEABD>>>}\n\\]"
