    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACEABCBEABCBBCDEE\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of \"A\".\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion of \"B\".\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: There is no \"CDEA\" in the string, so no insertion of \"C\".\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: There is no \"DEAB\" in the string, so no insertion of \"D\".\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 2. We insert \"E\" after this substring.\n\nLet's perform the operation and see the resulting string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"ACEABCBEABCBBCDEE\"\n\n# Function to perform one T operation\ndef perform_t_operation(s):\n    # Initialize the result as a list of characters for easy insertion\n    result = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(result) - 3:\n        # Check for each substring and perform the corresponding insertion\n        if result[i:i+4] == list(\"EABC\"):\n            result.insert(i+4, 'E')\n            i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Perform the T operation\nresult_string = perform_t_operation(initial_string)\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After performing one T operation on the string \"ACEABCBEABCBBCDEE\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<ACEABCEBEABCEBBCDEE>>>}\n\\]"
