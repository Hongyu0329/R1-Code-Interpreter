    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABABCDDDEABBBCDECC\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be performed from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n1. **ABCD**: The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 2. According to the rule, we insert 'A' after this substring. The string becomes \"ABABCADDD...\".\n2. **BCDE**: The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 12. According to the rule, we insert 'B' after this substring. The string becomes \"ABABCADDD...BCDEB...\".\n3. **CDEA**: The substring \"CDEA\" is not present in the string.\n4. **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 7. According to the rule, we insert 'D' after this substring. The string becomes \"ABABCADDDDEABDB...\".\n5. **EABC**: The substring \"EABC\" is not present in the string.\n\nNow, let's apply these operations in sequence to the string and see the final result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, insert_char in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"ABABCDDDEABBBCDECC\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying one T operation to the string \"ABABCDDDEABBBCDECC\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<ABABCDADDEABDBBCDEBCC>>>}\n\\]"
