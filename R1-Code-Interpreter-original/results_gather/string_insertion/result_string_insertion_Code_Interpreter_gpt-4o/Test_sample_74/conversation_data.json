    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: \n   - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 4. We insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"CBABCDAADEABBABCD\".\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is not present in the string.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is not present in the string.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 7. We insert 'D' after it, resulting in \"CBABCDAADEABDBABCD\".\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 10. We insert 'E' after it, resulting in \"CBABCDAADEABDBABEBCD\".\n\nNow, let's format the final string with the required format <<<a string>>>. \n\nThe final string after one operation T is: <<<CBABCDAADEABDBABEBCD>>>."
