    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAABCDCABCDADEAB\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: \n   - The substring \"ABCD\" appears at index 4. After this substring, we insert \"A\".\n   - The string becomes: \"EAABCD**A**CABCDADEAB\".\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" does not appear in the string.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" does not appear in the string.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" appears at index 12. After this substring, we insert \"D\".\n   - The string becomes: \"EAABCDACABCDADEAB**D**\".\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" appears at index 1. After this substring, we insert \"E\".\n   - The string becomes: \"EAB**E**CDACABCDADEABD\".\n\nNow, let's format the final string with the required format <<<a string>>>. \n\nThe final string after one operation T is: <<<EABECDACABCDADEABD>>>."
