    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EBCDEEBCDEEDEABA\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n2. **Insert Characters**: For each occurrence of a substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n3. **Order of Operations**: Since the operation is applied from left to right, we need to ensure that the insertions do not affect the detection of subsequent substrings.\n\nLet's apply this operation to the given string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize the result as a list of characters for easier manipulation\n    result = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i < len(result) - 3:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, char_to_insert in operations:\n            # If the substring is found, insert the character\n            if result[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                result.insert(i+4, char_to_insert)\n                i += 4  # Move past the inserted character\n                break\n        else:\n            i += 1  # Move to the next character if no operation was performed\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"EBCDEEBCDEEDEABA\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_output = f\"<<<{output_string}>>>\"\nformatted_output\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"EBCDEEBCDEEDEABA\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<EBCDEBEBCDEBEDEABDA>>>}\n\\]"
