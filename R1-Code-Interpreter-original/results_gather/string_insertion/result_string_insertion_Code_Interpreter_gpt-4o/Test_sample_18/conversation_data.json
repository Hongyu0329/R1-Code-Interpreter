    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: \n   - The substring \"ABCD\" appears at index 3. We insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"EAABCD**A**CABCDACDEAC\".\n   - The substring \"ABCD\" appears again at index 9 (after the first insertion). We insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"EAABCDACABCD**A**ACDEAC\".\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: \n   - The substring \"BCDE\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: \n   - The substring \"CDEA\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: \n   - The substring \"DEAB\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made.\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: \n   - The substring \"EABC\" appears at index 0. We insert 'E' after it, resulting in \"EABC**E**DACABCDACDEAC\".\n\nNow, let's apply these operations to the string and see the final result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # List to store the positions and characters to insert\n    insertions = []\n    \n    # Check for each substring and record the insertion\n    for i in range(len(s) - 3):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'A'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'B'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'C'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'D'))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, 'E'))\n    \n    # Apply insertions from left to right\n    result = list(s)\n    offset = 0\n    for pos, char in insertions:\n        result.insert(pos + offset, char)\n        offset += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Apply the operation and format the result\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(initial_string)\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<EAABCDACABCDAACDEACC>>>}\n\\]"
