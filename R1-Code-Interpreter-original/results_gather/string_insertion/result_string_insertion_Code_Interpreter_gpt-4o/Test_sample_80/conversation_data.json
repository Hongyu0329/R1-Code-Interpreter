    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DACDEAACDEADDEAB\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: There is one occurrence of \"CDEA\" starting at index 2. We insert \"C\" after this substring.\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 11. We insert \"D\" after this substring.\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: There is no \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nLet's apply these insertions to the string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"DACDEAACDEADDEAB\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Find and insert based on the rules\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            result.append(s[i:i+4] + \"C\")\n            i += 4\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            result.append(s[i:i+4] + \"D\")\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Apply the operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(initial_string)\nresult_string = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nresult_string\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DACDEAACDEADDEAB\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<DACDEACACDEACDDEABD>>>}\n\\]"
