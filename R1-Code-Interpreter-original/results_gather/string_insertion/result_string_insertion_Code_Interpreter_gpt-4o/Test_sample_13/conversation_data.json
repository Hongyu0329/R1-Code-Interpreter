    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings and Insertions:**\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n\n2. **Apply the Operation:**\n   - Start from the left of the string and move to the right, applying the insertions as you find the substrings.\n\nLet's apply this operation to the given string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string\n    while i <= len(s_list) - 4:\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, insert_char in operations:\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                # Insert the character after the substring\n                s_list.insert(i+4, insert_char)\n                # Move the index past the inserted character\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<DEABDDDEABDADEABDBA>>>}\n\\]"
