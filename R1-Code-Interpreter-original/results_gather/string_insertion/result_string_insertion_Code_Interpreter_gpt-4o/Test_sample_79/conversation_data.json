    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DABCDBABCDBABCDB\". The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings and Insertions:**\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n\n2. **Apply the Operation:**\n   - Start from the left of the string and move to the right, applying the insertions as you find the substrings.\n\nLet's apply this operation to the given string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and their corresponding insertions\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize the result string and index\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Process the string from left to right\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check each operation\n        for substring, insertion in operations:\n            if s[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:\n                # If the substring is found, append it and the insertion\n                result.append(substring + insertion)\n                i += len(substring)  # Move the index past the substring\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no substring is found, just append the current character\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DABCDBABCDBABCDB\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_t_operation(input_string)\noutput_string = f\"<<<{output_string}>>>\"\noutput_string\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DABCDBABCDBABCDB\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<DABCDABABCDABABCDAB>>>}\n\\]"
