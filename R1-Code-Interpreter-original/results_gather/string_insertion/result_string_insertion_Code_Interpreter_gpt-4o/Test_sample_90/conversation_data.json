    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DCABCDBDEABBABCD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: \n   - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 2. We insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"DCABCD**A**BDEABBABCD\".\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is not present in the string.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is not present in the string.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 8. We insert 'D' after it, resulting in \"DCABCDA**B**DEAB**D**BABCD\".\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 11. We insert 'E' after it, resulting in \"DCABCDA**B**DEABD**B**ABCD**E**\".\n\nNow, let's implement this in code to ensure accuracy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the substrings and corresponding characters to insert\n    operations = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n    s_list = list(s)\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string and apply the operations\n    while i < len(s_list) - 3:\n        for substring, char_to_insert in operations:\n            if s_list[i:i+4] == list(substring):\n                # Insert the character after the substring\n                s_list.insert(i + 4, char_to_insert)\n                # Move the index past the inserted character\n                i += 4\n                break\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"DCABCDBDEABBABCD\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\nresult_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"DCABCDBDEABBABCD\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<DCABCDABDEABDBABCDA>>>} \\]"
