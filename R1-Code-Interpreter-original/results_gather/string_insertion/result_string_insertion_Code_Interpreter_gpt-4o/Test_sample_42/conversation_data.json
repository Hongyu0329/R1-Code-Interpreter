    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EABCCEABCACDEA\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: EABCCEABCACDEA\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion of 'B'.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"CDEA\" starting at index 9. Insert 'C' after this substring.\n   - String becomes: EABCCEABCACDEAC\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is no \"DEAB\" in the string, so no insertion of 'D'.\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 4. Insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - String becomes: EABCCEABCECACDEAC\n\nNow, let's format the final string with the required format.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\r\ninitial_string = \"EABCCEABCACDEA\"\r\n\r\n# Apply the T operation\r\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\r\n    # Check for each substring and insert the corresponding character\r\n    result = s\r\n    insertions = []\r\n\r\n    # Check for \"CDEA\" and insert 'C'\r\n    index = result.find(\"CDEA\")\r\n    if index != -1:\r\n        insertions.append((index + 4, 'C'))\r\n\r\n    # Check for \"EABC\" and insert 'E'\r\n    index = result.find(\"EABC\")\r\n    if index != -1:\r\n        insertions.append((index + 4, 'E'))\r\n\r\n    # Sort insertions by index to insert from left to right\r\n    insertions.sort()\r\n\r\n    # Perform insertions\r\n    offset = 0\r\n    for index, char in insertions:\r\n        result = result[:index + offset] + char + result[index + offset:]\r\n        offset += 1\r\n\r\n    return result\r\n\r\n# Apply the operation and format the result\r\nfinal_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\r\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{final_string}>>>\"\r\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"EABCCEABCACDEA\", the resulting string is formatted as:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<EABCECEABCACDEAC>>>} \\]"
