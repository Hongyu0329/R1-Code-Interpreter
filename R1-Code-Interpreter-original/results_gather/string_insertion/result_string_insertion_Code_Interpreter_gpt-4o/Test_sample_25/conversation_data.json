    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABBABCDAEABCBD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: \n   - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 6. We insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"ADEABBABCD**A**AEABCBD\".\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"CDEA\" in the string.\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: \n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 1. We insert 'D' after it, resulting in \"A**DEAB**D**BABCDAAEABCBD\".\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: \n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 11. We insert 'E' after it, resulting in \"ADEABBABCDA**EABC**E**BD\".\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions in order and construct the final string.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"ADEABBABCDAEABCBD\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\n# Insertions are done from left to right\n# 1.

Insert 'E' after \"EABC\"\nfinal_string = step2[:15] + \"E\" + step2[15:]\n\n# Format the final string\nformatted_final_string = f\"<<<{final_string}>>>\"\nformatted_final_string\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"ADEABBABCDAEABCBD\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<ADEABDBABCDAAEAEBCBD>>>}\n\\]"
