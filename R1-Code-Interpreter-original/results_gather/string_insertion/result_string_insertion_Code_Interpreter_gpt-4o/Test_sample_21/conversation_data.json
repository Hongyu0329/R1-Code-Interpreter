    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n1. **ABCD**: Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\".\n2. **BCDE**: Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n3. **CDEA**: Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n4. **DEAB**: Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n5. **EABC**: Insert 'E' after \"EABC\".\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the string \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\".
