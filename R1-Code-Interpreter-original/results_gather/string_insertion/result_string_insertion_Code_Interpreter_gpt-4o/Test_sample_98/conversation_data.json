    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be performed from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**:\n   - Found at index 2: \"ABCD\" -> Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\" -> Result: EAABCD**A**ADEABECDEAAA\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**:\n   - Found at index 11: \"BCDE\" -> Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\" -> Result: EAABCDADEABECDE**B**AAA\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**:\n   - Found at index 12: \"CDEA\" -> Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\" -> Result: EAABCDADEABECDEB**C**AAA\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**:\n   - Found at index 7: \"DEAB\" -> Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\" -> Result: EAABCDADEAB**D**ECDEBCAAA\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**:\n   - Found at index 1: \"EABC\" -> Insert 'E' after \"EABC\" -> Result: EA**E**ABCDADEABD**E**CDEBCAAA\n\nAfter applying all the operations from left to right, the final string is \"EAEABCDADEABDECDEBCAAA\".\n\nTherefore, the result after one operation T is:\n\n<<<EAEABCDADEABDECDEBCAAA>>>"
