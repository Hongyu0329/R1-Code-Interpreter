    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDBDEABEEABC\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **ABCD**: The substring \"ABCD\" is found at the beginning of the string. According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"ABCDA\" followed by the rest of the string.\n\n2. **BCDE**: After the first insertion, the string is \"ABCDA\" followed by \"BDEABEEABC\". The substring \"BCDE\" is not present, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n3. **CDEA**: The substring \"CDEA\" is not present in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n4. **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at position 6 (considering the string after the first insertion). According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"ABCDA\" followed by \"BDEABD\" and the rest of the string.\n\n5. **EABC**: The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at position 11 (considering the string after the previous insertions). According to rule 5, we insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"ABCDA\" followed by \"BDEABD\" and \"EEABC\" followed by 'E'.\n\nNow, let's perform these operations programmatically to ensure accuracy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef apply_T_operation(s):\n    # Define the rules for the T operation\n    rules = [\n        (\"ABCD\", \"A\"),\n        (\"BCDE\", \"B\"),\n        (\"CDEA\", \"C\"),\n        (\"DEAB\", \"D\"),\n        (\"EABC\", \"E\")\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize the result string and index\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    \n    # Process the string from left to right\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check each rule\n        for pattern, insert_char in rules:\n            if s[i:i+len(pattern)] == pattern:\n                # Append the pattern and the insertion character\n                result.append(s[i:i+len(pattern)] + insert_char)\n                # Move the index past the pattern\n                i += len(pattern)\n                break\n        else:\n            # If no pattern matched, just append the current character\n            result.append(s[i])\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Join the result list into a final string\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Given string\ninput_string = \"ABCDBDEABEEABC\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\noutput_string = apply_T_operation(input_string)\noutput_string = f\"<<<{output_string}>>>\"\noutput_string\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"ABCDBDEABEEABC\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<ABCDABDEABDEEABCE>>>} \\]"
