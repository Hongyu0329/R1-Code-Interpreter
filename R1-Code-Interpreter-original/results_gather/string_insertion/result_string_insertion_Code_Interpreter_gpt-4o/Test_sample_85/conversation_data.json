    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EABCBDEABADEAB\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation should be applied from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: EABCBDEABADEAB\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**: \n   - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A'.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**: \n   - There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion of 'B'.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**: \n   - There is no \"CDEA\" in the string, so no insertion of 'C'.\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 8. Insert 'D' after this substring.\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**: \n   - There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 0. Insert 'E' after this substring.\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions to the string from left to right.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"EABCBDEABADEAB\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\n# Insertions to be made\ninsertions = []\n\n# Check for each substring and record the insertion\nfor i in range(len(initial_string) - 3):\n    substring = initial_string[i:i+4]\n    if substring == \"ABCD\":\n        insertions.append((i+4, 'A'))\n    elif substring == \"BCDE\":\n        insertions.append((i+4, 'B'))\n    elif substring == \"CDEA\":\n        insertions.append((i+4, 'C'))\n    elif substring == \"DEAB\":\n        insertions.append((i+4, 'D'))\n    elif substring == \"EABC\":\n        insertions.append((i+4, 'E'))\n\n# Apply insertions from left to right\nresult_string = list(initial_string)\noffset = 0\nfor index, char in sorted(insertions):\n    result_string.insert(index + offset, char)\n    offset += 1\n\n# Convert list back to string\nresult_string = ''.join(result_string)\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying one T operation to the string \"EABCBDEABADEAB\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<EABCEBDEABDADEABD>>>}\n\\]"
