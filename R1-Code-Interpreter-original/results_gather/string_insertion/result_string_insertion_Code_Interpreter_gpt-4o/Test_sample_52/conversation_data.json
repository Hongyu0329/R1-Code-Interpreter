    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation step by step:\n\n1. **Check for \"ABCD\"**: There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n2. **Check for \"BCDE\"**: The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 1. According to the rule, we insert \"B\" after \"BCDE\", resulting in \"BBCDEB\".\n\n3. **Check for \"CDEA\"**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 2. According to the rule, we insert \"C\" after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"CDEAC\".\n\n4. **Check for \"DEAB\"**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 8. According to the rule, we insert \"D\" after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"DEABD\".\n\n5. **Check for \"EABC\"**: There is no \"EABC\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions to the string and see the result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\"\n\n# Apply the T operation\n# Insertions are done from left to right, so we need to keep track of the index shifts\nresult = list(initial_string)\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(result) - 3:\n    # Check for \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\"\n    if result[i:i+4] == list(\"BCDE\"):\n        result.insert(i+4, 'B')\n        i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n    \n    # Check for \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\"\n    elif result[i:i+4] == list(\"CDEA\"):\n        result.insert(i+4, 'C')\n        i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n    \n    # Check for \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\"\n    elif result[i:i+4] == list(\"DEAB\"):\n        result.insert(i+4, 'D')\n        i += 5  # Move past the inserted character\n    \n    else:\n        i += 1  # Move to the next character\n\n# Convert the list back to a string\nresult_string = ''.join(result)\nformatted_result = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nformatted_result\nassistant > After applying one T operation to the string \"BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<BBCDEBBDEABDADEABDBA>>>}\n\\]"
