    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\" by checking for each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation is performed from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\n\n2. **Check for Substrings and Insert Characters**:\n   - Look for \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n   - Look for \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n   - Look for \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n   - Look for \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n   - Look for \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n\n3. **Apply the T Operation**:\n   - Find \"BCDE\" at index 0, insert \"B\" after it.\n   - Find \"CDEA\" at index 5, insert \"C\" after it.\n   - Find \"CDEA\" at index 10, insert \"C\" after it.\n\nLet's perform these operations step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial string\ninitial_string = \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\"\n\n# Function to apply the T operation\ndef apply_t_operation(s):\n    # List to store the positions and characters to insert\n    insertions = []\n    \n    # Check for each substring and record the insertion\n    for i in range(len(s) - 3):\n        if s[i:i+4] == \"ABCD\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, \"A\"))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"BCDE\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, \"B\"))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"CDEA\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, \"C\"))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"DEAB\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, \"D\"))\n        elif s[i:i+4] == \"EABC\":\n            insertions.append((i+4, \"E\"))\n    \n    # Apply insertions from left to right\n    result = list(s)\n    offset = 0\n    for pos, char in insertions:\n        result.insert(pos + offset, char)\n        offset += 1\n    \n    return \"\".join(result)\n\n# Apply the T operation to the initial string\nresult_string = apply_t_operation(initial_string)\nresult_string = f\"<<<{result_string}>>>\"\nresult_string\nassistant > After applying the T operation to the string \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\", the resulting string is:\n\n\\[ \\text{<<<BCDEBCCDEACECDEACAD>>>} \\]"
