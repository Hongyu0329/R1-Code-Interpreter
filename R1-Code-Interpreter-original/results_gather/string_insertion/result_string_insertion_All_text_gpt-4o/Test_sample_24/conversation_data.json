    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBCDEECDEAACDEA\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"BBCDEECDEAACDEA\":\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the substrings:\n  - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 1.\n  - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 6.\n  - The substring \"CDEA\" is found again starting at index 10.\n\n- **Step 2**: Apply the insertions from left to right:\n  - For the first \"BCDE\" at index 1, insert 'B' after it. The string becomes \"BBCDEBECDEAACDEA\".\n  - For the first \"CDEA\" at index 6 (originally), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"BBCDEBECDECAACDEA\".\n  - For the second \"CDEA\" at index 10 (originally), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"BBCDEBECDECAACDECA\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Ensure all insertions are accounted for and the final string is constructed correctly.\n\nAfter performing these operations, the final string after one T operation is:\n\n<<<BBCDEBECDECAACDECA>>>"
