    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DACDEAACDEADDEAB\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the positions of subsequent substrings may shift. Therefore, we need to carefully track these changes to ensure that all insertions are made correctly.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string \"DACDEAACDEADDEAB\":\n\n- **Initial String**: DACDEAACDEADDEAB\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"CDEA\" starting from the left. It is found at position 2 (0-based index). According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"DACDEACACDEADDEAB\".\n\n- **Step 2**: Continue scanning the string from the last insertion point. The next occurrence of \"CDEA\" is found at position 8. Insert 'C' after this substring. The string becomes \"DACDEACACDEACADDEAB\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Continue scanning. The next occurrence of \"DEAB\" is found at position 12. Insert 'D' after this substring. The string becomes \"DACDEACACDEACADDEADAB\".\n\n- **Step 4**: Continue scanning. No more specified substrings are found in the string.\n\nAfter applying the T operation once, the final string is \"DACDEACACDEACADDEADAB\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<DACDEACACDEACADDEADAB>>>"
