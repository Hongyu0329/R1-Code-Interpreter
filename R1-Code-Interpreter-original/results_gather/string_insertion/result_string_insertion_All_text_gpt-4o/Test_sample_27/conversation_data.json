    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBEABCCABCDADEABB\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start with the initial string: \"BBEABCCABCDADEABB\".\n   - Scan the string from left to right to find the substrings and apply the insertions.\n\n4. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - **Initial String**: \"BBEABCCABCDADEABB\"\n   - **Find Substrings**:\n     - \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 7. According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\".\n     - \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 11. According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n   - **Apply Insertions**:\n     - After inserting 'A' after \"ABCD\" (at index 11), the string becomes \"BBEABCCABCD**A**ADEABB\".\n     - After inserting 'D' after \"DEAB\" (at index 15, considering the previous insertion), the string becomes \"BBEABCCABCDA**A**DEAB**D**B\".\n\n5. **Final String**: After applying all insertions, the final string is \"BBEABCCABCDAADEABDB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BBEABCCABCDAADEABDB>>>"
