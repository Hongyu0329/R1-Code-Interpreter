    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DACDEAADEABEEABCEB\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we make insertions, the string will change, and we need to ensure that subsequent insertions are based on the updated string.\n\nLet's go through the string:\n\n- **Initial String**: DACDEAADEABEEABCEB\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for \"ABCD\". There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for \"BCDE\". There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"CDEA\". There is one occurrence starting at index 2: \"CDEA\". According to the rule, insert \"C\" after \"CDEA\". The string becomes: DACDEACAADEABEEABCEB.\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"DEAB\". There is one occurrence starting at index 8: \"DEAB\". According to the rule, insert \"D\" after \"DEAB\". The string becomes: DACDEACAADEABDABEEABCEB.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"EABC\". There is one occurrence starting at index 15: \"EABC\". According to the rule, insert \"E\" after \"EABC\". The string becomes: DACDEACAADEABDABEEABCEEB.\n\nAfter applying all the rules from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<DACDEACAADEABDABEEABCEEB>>>"
