    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EADEABDABCDCBCDE\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. Therefore, we need to adjust our search for substrings accordingly.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **Initial String**: EADEABDABCDCBCDE\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for \"ABCD\". The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 8. According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes: EADEABDABCDA(C)BCDE.\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for \"BCDE\". The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 13. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes: EADEABDABCDA(C)BCDEB.\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"CDEA\". The substring \"CDEA\" is not present in the string.\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"DEAB\". The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 2. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes: EADEABD(D)ABCDA(C)BCDEB.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"EABC\". The substring \"EABC\" is not present in the string.\n\nAfter applying all applicable rules, the final string after one operation T is: EADEABDDABCDA(C)BCDEB.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<EADEABDDABCDCBCDEB>>>"
