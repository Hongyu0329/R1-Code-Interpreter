    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACDEAEBCDECCDEA\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: \"ACDEAEBCDECCDEA\"\n\n2. **Identify Substrings and Insertions**:\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right and look for the specified substrings: ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC.\n   - For each occurrence of a substring, we insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Performing the T Operation**:\n   - Start from the beginning of the string and look for the first occurrence of any of the specified substrings.\n   - **First Occurrence**: \"BCDE\" at index 6 (0-based index). According to rule 2, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n     - String becomes: \"ACDEAEBCDEBCCEDEA\"\n   - **Next Occurrence**: \"CDEA\" at index 10 (after the previous insertion). According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n     - String becomes: \"ACDEAEBCDEBCCCEDEA\"\n   - **Next Occurrence**: \"CDEA\" at index 13 (after the previous insertion). According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n     - String becomes: \"ACDEAEBCDEBCCCDEAC\"\n\n4. **Final String**:\n   - After processing all possible substrings from left to right, the final string is \"ACDEAEBCDEBCCCDEAC\".\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the result as requested.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<ACDEAEBCDEBCCCDEAC>>>"
