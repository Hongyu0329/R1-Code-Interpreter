    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EBCDEEBCDEEDEABA\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: EBCDEEBCDEEDEABA\n\n2. **Identify Substrings**:\n   - We need to look for the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the string.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE)**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" appears twice in the string:\n     - First occurrence: EBCDE\n     - Second occurrence: EBCDE\n   - According to Rule 2, we insert 'B' after each occurrence of \"BCDE\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB)**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" appears once in the string:\n     - Occurrence: DEAB\n   - According to Rule 4, we insert 'D' after the occurrence of \"DEAB\".\n\n5. **Perform Insertions**:\n   - Insertions are performed from left to right.\n   - After the first \"BCDE\", insert 'B': EBCDEBEEBCDEEDEABA\n   - After the second \"BCDE\", insert 'B': EBCDEBEEBCDEBEDEABA\n   - After \"DEAB\", insert 'D': EBCDEBEEBCDEBEDEABDA\n\n6. **Final String**:\n   - After performing all insertions, the final string is: EBCDEBEEBCDEBEDEABDA\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is: <<<EBCDEBEEBCDEBEDEABDA>>>"
