    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB\":\n\n- **Initial String**: EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the substrings and their positions:\n  - BCDE at index 3 (EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB)\n  - BCDE at index 8 (EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB)\n  - CDEA at index 9 (EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB)\n  - ABCD at index 12 (EDBCDEEBCDECABCDCB)\n\n- **Step 2**: Apply the insertions from left to right:\n  - Insert B after the first BCDE (index 3): EDBCDEBEEBCDECABCDCB\n  - Insert B after the second BCDE (index 8): EDBCDEBEEBCDEBCABCDCB\n  - Insert C after CDEA (index 9): EDBCDEBEEBCDEBCACDCDCB\n  - Insert A after ABCD (index 12): EDBCDEBEEBCDEBCACDACDCB\n\n- **Final String**: After applying all insertions, the final string is \"EDBCDEBEEBCDEBCACDACDCB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<EDBCDEBEEBCDEBCACDACDCB>>>"
