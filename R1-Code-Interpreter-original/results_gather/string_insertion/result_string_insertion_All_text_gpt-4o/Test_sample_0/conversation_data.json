    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DBCDEDCDEAECDEA\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, meaning that once a character is inserted, it affects the position of subsequent substrings.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start with the string: \"DBCDEDCDEAECDEA\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - Found at index 1 (\"BCDE\" starts at position 1).\n     - Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\", resulting in \"DBCBEDCDEAECDEA\".\n   - Continue scanning the updated string from left to right:\n     - Next, look for \"CDEA\":\n       - Found at index 7 (\"CDEA\" starts at position 7).\n       - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"DBCBEDCDEACECDEA\".\n   - Continue scanning:\n     - Look for \"CDEA\" again:\n       - Found at index 12 (\"CDEA\" starts at position 12).\n       - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"DBCBEDCDEACECDEAC\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After processing all possible substrings from left to right, the final string is \"DBCBEDCDEACECDEAC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DBCBEDCDEACECDEAC>>>"
