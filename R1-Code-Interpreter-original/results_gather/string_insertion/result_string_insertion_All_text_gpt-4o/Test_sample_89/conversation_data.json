    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AEABCADEABAEABCBD\" by checking each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation is performed from left to right, meaning we need to be careful about the order of operations and how the string changes as we insert characters.\n\nLet's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: AEABCADEABAEABCBD\n\n2. **Check for Substring ABCD**:\n   - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 3 (AEAB**C**ADEABAEABCBD).\n   - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\": AEABCA**A**DEABAEABCBD\n\n3. **Check for Substring BCDE**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 5 (AEABCA**D**EABAEABCBD).\n   - Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\": AEABCADEB**B**AEABCBD\n\n4. **Check for Substring CDEA**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 6 (AEABCADEB**A**EABCBD).\n   - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\": AEABCADEABCA**C**EABCBD\n\n5. **Check for Substring DEAB**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 7 (AEABCADEAB**A**EABCBD).\n   - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\": AEABCADEABDA**D**EABCBD\n\n6. **Check for Substring EABC**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 10 (AEABCADEABDA**B**EABCBD).\n   - Insert 'E' after \"EABC\": AEABCADEABDAEABCE**E**CBD\n\nAfter performing all the insertions from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<AEABCADEABDAEABCEECBD>>>"
