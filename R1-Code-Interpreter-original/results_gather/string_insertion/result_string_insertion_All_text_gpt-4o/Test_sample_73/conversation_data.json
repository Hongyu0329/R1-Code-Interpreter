    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEAADEABEEABC\" and determine the resulting string. Let's analyze the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all the substrings in the given string that match the patterns specified in the T operation rules. The substrings to look for are:\n   - ABCD\n   - BCDE\n   - CDEA\n   - DEAB\n   - EABC\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the positions where insertions are made to ensure the correct order.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"CDEAADEABEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - Found at position 1 (0-based index), insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n     - Resulting string: \"CDEACAADEABEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n     - Found at position 6 (0-based index), insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n     - Resulting string: \"CDEACAADEABDEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\":\n     - Found at position 11 (0-based index), insert 'E' after \"EABC\".\n     - Resulting string: \"CDEACAADEABDEEABEC\".\n\n4. **Final Result**: After applying the T operation once, the resulting string is \"CDEACAADEABDEEABEC\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<CDEACAADEABDEEABEC>>>"
