    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CAEABCCEABCCBCDEEE\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to adjust our search and insertion positions accordingly.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **Initial String**: CAEABCCEABCCBCDEEE\n\n- **Search for Substrings**:\n  - Look for \"ABCD\": There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n  - Look for \"BCDE\": Found at position 12 (BCDE).\n  - Look for \"CDEA\": There is no \"CDEA\" in the string.\n  - Look for \"DEAB\": There is no \"DEAB\" in the string.\n  - Look for \"EABC\": Found at position 3 (EABC).\n\n- **Apply Insertions**:\n  - For \"BCDE\" at position 12, insert 'B' after it. The string becomes: CAEABCCEABCCBCDEBEE\n  - For \"EABC\" at position 3, insert 'E' after it. The string becomes: CAEABCCEABCEBCCBCDEBEE\n\n- **Final String**: After applying all insertions from left to right, the final string is \"CAEABCCEABCEBCCBCDEBEE\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<CAEABCCEABCEBCCBCDEBEE>>>"
