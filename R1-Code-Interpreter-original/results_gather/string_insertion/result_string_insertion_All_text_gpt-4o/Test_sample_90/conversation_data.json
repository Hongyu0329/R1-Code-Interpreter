    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DCABCDBDEABBABCD\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation:**\n   - For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Process the String:**\n   - Start from the leftmost part of the string and move to the right, applying the T operation as we find each substring.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - The given string is \"DCABCDBDEABBABCD\".\n   - Start from the left:\n     - **\"ABCD\"** is found starting at index 2 (substring \"ABCD\" from index 2 to 5). According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"DCABCDAABCD\".\n     - Continue from the next character after the inserted 'A' (index 6):\n     - **\"BCDE\"** is not found.\n     - **\"CDEA\"** is not found.\n     - **\"DEAB\"** is found starting at index 7 (substring \"DEAB\" from index 7 to 10). According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"DCABCDAABCDDEABDBABCD\".\n     - Continue from the next character after the inserted 'D' (index 11):\n     - **\"EABC\"** is not found.\n     - **\"ABCD\"** is found again starting at index 13 (substring \"ABCD\" from index 13 to 16). According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"DCABCDAABCDDEABDBABCDABCD\".\n\n5. **Final String:**\n   - After processing the entire string from left to right, the final string after one T operation is \"DCABCDAABCDDEABDBABCDABCD\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<DCABCDAABCDDEABDBABCDABCD>>>"
