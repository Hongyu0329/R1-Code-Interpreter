    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABABCDDDEABBBCDECC\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we apply each insertion.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"ABABCDDDEABBBCDECC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\":\n     - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 2 (0-based index). After \"ABCD\", insert 'A'. The string becomes \"ABABCDADDEABBBCDECC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 13 (after the previous insertion). After \"BCDE\", insert 'B'. The string becomes \"ABABCDADDEABBBCDEBCC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 14 (after the previous insertion). After \"CDEA\", insert 'C'. The string becomes \"ABABCDADDEABBBCDEBCACC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n     - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 9 (after the first insertion). After \"DEAB\", insert 'D'. The string becomes \"ABABCDADDEADABBBCDEBCACC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\":\n     - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 10 (after the previous insertion). After \"EABC\", insert 'E'. The string becomes \"ABABCDADDEADEABBBCDEBCACC\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all the insertions, the final string is \"ABABCDADDEADEABBBCDEBCACC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ABABCDADDEADEABBBCDEBCACC>>>"
