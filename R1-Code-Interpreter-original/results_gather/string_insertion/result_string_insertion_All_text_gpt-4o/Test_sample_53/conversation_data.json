    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDACDEAACDEACB\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"ABCDACDEAACDEACB\".\n   - **Find \"ABCD\"**: The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"ABCDAACDEAACDEACB\".\n   - **Find \"CDEA\"**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 7 (in the updated string). According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"ABCDAACDEACCAACDEACB\".\n   - **Find \"CDEA\" again**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 12 (in the updated string). According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"ABCDAACDEACCAACDEACCB\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all applicable operations from left to right, the final string is \"ABCDAACDEACCAACDEACCB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ABCDAACDEACCAACDEACCB>>>"
