    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AEABCBEABCBEABCE\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"AEABCBEABCBEABCE\":\n\n- **Initial String**: AEABCBEABCBEABCE\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for the substring \"ABCD\". There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for the substring \"BCDE\". There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for the substring \"CDEA\". There is no \"CDEA\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for the substring \"DEAB\". There is no \"DEAB\" in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for the substring \"EABC\". There are two occurrences of \"EABC\" in the string:\n  - The first occurrence is at positions 2-5 (EABC). According to the rule, we insert 'E' after this substring.\n  - The second occurrence is at positions 8-11 (EABC). After the first insertion, this occurrence shifts to positions 9-12. We insert 'E' after this substring.\n\n- **Perform Insertions**: \n  - After the first insertion, the string becomes \"AEABECBEABCBEABCE\".\n  - After the second insertion, the string becomes \"AEABECBEABECBEABCE\".\n\n- **Final String**: After applying all applicable insertions, the final string is \"AEABECBEABECBEABCE\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<AEABECBEABECBEABCE>>>"
