    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDCDEADABCDA\" and analyze each step carefully. The T operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is performed from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: DEABDCDEADABCDA\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**:\n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A' is needed.\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**:\n   - There is no occurrence of \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion of 'B' is needed.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**:\n   - There is one occurrence of \"CDEA\" starting at index 4 (0-based index).\n   - Insert 'C' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: DEABDCDEACDABCDA\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**:\n   - There is one occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 0.\n   - Insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: DEABDCDCEACDABCDA\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**:\n   - There is one occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 10.\n   - Insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: DEABDCDCEACDABECDA\n\nAfter performing all the insertions from left to right, the final string is \"DEABDCDCEACDABECDA\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<DEABDCDCEACDABECDA>>>"
