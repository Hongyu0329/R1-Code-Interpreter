    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABADEABDCDEADD\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to scan the string from left to right to identify any of the specified substrings: ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the positions where insertions are made to ensure they do not interfere with each other.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start with the string: \"DEABADEABDCDEADD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\". It is found starting at index 0. According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"DEABDABDEABDCDEADD\".\n   - Continue scanning the string from the next position after the inserted character. The next \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 6 (considering the previous insertion). Insert 'D' after this \"DEAB\", resulting in \"DEABDABDEABDCDDEADD\".\n   - Continue scanning. The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 11. According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"DEABDABDEABDCDCEADD\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After processing all possible substrings and applying the insertions, the final string is \"DEABDABDEABDCDCEADD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DEABDABDEABDCDCEADD>>>"
