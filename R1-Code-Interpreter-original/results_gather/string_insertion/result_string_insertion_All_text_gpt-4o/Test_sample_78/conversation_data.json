    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDBABCDCCDEA\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"ABCDBABCDCCDEA\":\n\n- **First Occurrence of Substring ABCD**: \n  - The first occurrence of \"ABCD\" is at the start of the string (positions 0 to 3).\n  - According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after this substring.\n  - The string becomes: \"ABCDA**B**ABCDCCDEA\".\n\n- **Second Occurrence of Substring ABCD**:\n  - After the first insertion, the next \"ABCD\" starts at position 6 (originally at position 5 before the first insertion).\n  - Insert 'A' after this substring.\n  - The string becomes: \"ABCDA**B**ABCDA**C**CCDEA\".\n\n- **Occurrence of Substring CDEA**:\n  - After the second insertion, \"CDEA\" starts at position 11 (originally at position 10 before the second insertion).\n  - According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after this substring.\n  - The string becomes: \"ABCDA**B**ABCDA**C**CCDEAC**D**A\".\n\n- **No Other Substrings**:\n  - After these insertions, there are no more occurrences of the specified substrings in the string.\n\nThus, after applying one T operation, the final string is \"ABCDAABCDAACCDEACDA\".\n\nThe answer is: <<<ABCDAABCDAACCDEACDA>>>."
