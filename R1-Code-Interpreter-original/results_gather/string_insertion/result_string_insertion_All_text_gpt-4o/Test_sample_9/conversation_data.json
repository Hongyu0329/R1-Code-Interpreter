    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAEABCBDEABACDEADB\" by checking each of the defined substrings and inserting the specified character after each occurrence. We will process the string from left to right, ensuring that any insertions do not affect the detection of subsequent substrings.\n\nLet's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: EAEABCBDEABACDEADB\n\n2. **Check for Substring ABCD**:\n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for Substring BCDE**:\n   - There is no occurrence of \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n4. **Check for Substring CDEA**:\n   - There is no occurrence of \"CDEA\" in the string.\n\n5. **Check for Substring DEAB**:\n   - There is an occurrence of \"DEAB\" starting at index 7 (DEABACDEADB).\n   - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\": EAEABCBDEADBACDEADB\n\n6. **Check for Substring EABC**:\n   - There is an occurrence of \"EABC\" starting at index 2 (EABCBDEADBACDEADB).\n   - Insert 'E' after \"EABC\": EAEABCECBDEADBACDEADB\n\nAfter processing the string from left to right and applying the T operation, the final string is:\n\n<<<EAEABCECBDEADBACDEADB>>>"
