    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DABCDBABCDBABCDB\" and analyze each step carefully. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"DABCDBABCDBABCDB\".\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\":\n     - The first occurrence is at index 1 (0-based index), \"ABCD\" is found at positions 1-4. Insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"DABCADBCDBABCDB\".\n     - The next occurrence is at index 7, \"ABCD\" is found at positions 7-10. Insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"DABCADBCDABACDB\".\n     - The next occurrence is at index 13, \"ABCD\" is found at positions 13-16. Insert 'A' after it, resulting in \"DABCADBCDABACDAB\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - There are no occurrences of \"BCDE\" in the string.\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - There are no occurrences of \"CDEA\" in the string.\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n     - There are no occurrences of \"DEAB\" in the string.\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\":\n     - There are no occurrences of \"EABC\" in the string.\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying the T operation, the final string is \"DABCADBCDABACDAB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is: <<<DABCADBCDABACDAB>>>."
