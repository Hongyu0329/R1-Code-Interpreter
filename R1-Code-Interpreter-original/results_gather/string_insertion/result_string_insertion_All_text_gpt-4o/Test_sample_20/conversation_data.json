    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CECDEACABCDDABCDC\" by checking each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character. We will process the string from left to right, applying the rules in the order they are given.\n\n1. **Initial String**: CECDEACABCDDABCDC\n\n2. **Check for Substring ABCD**:\n   - The substring \"ABCD\" appears at index 7 (starting from 0). According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after this substring.\n   - New string: CECDEACABCD**A**DABCDC\n\n3. **Check for Substring BCDE**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n4. **Check for Substring CDEA**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" appears at index 2. According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after this substring.\n   - New string: CECDEAC**C**ABCDADABCDC\n\n5. **Check for Substring DEAB**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n6. **Check for Substring EABC**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\nAfter applying the T operation, the final string is \"CECDEAC**C**ABCD**A**DABCDC\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<CECDEACCABCDADABCDC>>>"
