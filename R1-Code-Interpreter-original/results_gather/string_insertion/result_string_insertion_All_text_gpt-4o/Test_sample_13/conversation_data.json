    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\":\n\n- **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"DEABD\".\n\n- **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found again starting at index 7. We insert 'D' after this occurrence, resulting in \"DEABDDEABDA\".\n\n- **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found again starting at index 11. We insert 'D' after this occurrence, resulting in \"DEABDDEABDADEABD\".\n\nNow, let's construct the final string after all insertions:\n\n- Start with the original string: \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\".\n- After the first insertion at index 4: \"DEABDDEABADEABBA\".\n- After the second insertion at index 11: \"DEABDDEABDADEABBA\".\n- After the third insertion at index 15: \"DEABDDEABDADEABDDBA\".\n\nThe final string after applying one T operation is \"DEABDDEABDADEABDDBA\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<DEABDDEABDADEABDDBA>>>"
