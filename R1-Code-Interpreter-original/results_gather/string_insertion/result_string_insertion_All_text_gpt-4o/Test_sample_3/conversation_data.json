    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEADDEABEEABCE\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. We will analyze the string step by step, checking for each of the specified substrings and performing the corresponding insertions.\n\n1. **Initial String**: CDEADDEABEEABCE\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start from the left and look for the substrings in the order they are defined.\n   \n   - **Check for \"ABCD\"**: \n     - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A' is needed.\n\n   - **Check for \"BCDE\"**: \n     - There is no \"BCDE\" in the string, so no insertion of 'B' is needed.\n\n   - **Check for \"CDEA\"**: \n     - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 0. According to the rule, insert 'C' after this substring.\n     - The string becomes: CDEACADDEABEEABCE\n\n   - **Check for \"DEAB\"**: \n     - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 5 (after the first insertion). According to the rule, insert 'D' after this substring.\n     - The string becomes: CDEACADDEABDDEEABCE\n\n   - **Check for \"EABC\"**: \n     - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 12 (after the second insertion). According to the rule, insert 'E' after this substring.\n     - The string becomes: CDEACADDEABDDEEABCEEC\n\n3. **Final String**:\n   - After performing all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is: CDEACADDEABDDEEABCEEC\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is: <<<CDEACADDEABDDEEABCEEC>>>"
