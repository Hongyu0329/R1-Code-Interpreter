    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DCABCDCEABCAABCDCE\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n- **Initial String**: DCABCDCEABCAABCDCE\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of \"ABCD\" starting from the left.\n  - Found \"ABCD\" at index 3. Insert 'A' after it.\n  - New string: DCABCD**A**CEABCAABCDCE\n\n- **Step 2**: Continue from the last insertion point and look for the next occurrence of \"ABCD\".\n  - Found \"ABCD\" at index 12 (considering the previous insertion). Insert 'A' after it.\n  - New string: DCABCDACEABCAABCD**A**CE\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"BCDE\" in the string.\n  - No occurrence of \"BCDE\" is found.\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"CDEA\" in the string.\n  - No occurrence of \"CDEA\" is found.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"DEAB\" in the string.\n  - No occurrence of \"DEAB\" is found.\n\n- **Step 6**: Look for \"EABC\" in the string.\n  - Found \"EABC\" at index 7. Insert 'E' after it.\n  - New string: DCABCDACEAB**E**CAABCDACE\n\nAfter applying all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<DCABCDACEABECAABCDACE>>>"
