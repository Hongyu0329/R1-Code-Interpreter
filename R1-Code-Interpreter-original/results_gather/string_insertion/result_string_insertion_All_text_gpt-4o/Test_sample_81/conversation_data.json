    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"CBCDECABCDACDEA\".\n   - Check for the substring \"ABCD\":\n     - Found at index 6 (\"ABCD\" starts at index 6).\n     - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\", resulting in \"CBCDECABCD**A**ACDEA\".\n   - Check for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - Found at index 2 (\"BCDE\" starts at index 2).\n     - Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\", resulting in \"CBCDE**B**CABCDACDEA\".\n   - Check for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - Found at index 9 (\"CDEA\" starts at index 9).\n     - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"CBCDEBCABCDACDEA**C**\".\n   - Check for the substring \"DEAB\":\n     - Found at index 3 (\"DEAB\" starts at index 3).\n     - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"CBCDEBCABCDACDEA**CD**\".\n   - Check for the substring \"EABC\":\n     - Found at index 4 (\"EABC\" starts at index 4).\n     - Insert 'E' after \"EABC\", resulting in \"CBCDEBCABCDACDEA**CDE**\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all the insertions, the final string is \"CBCDEBCABCDACDEACDE\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<CBCDEBCABCDACDEACDE>>>"
