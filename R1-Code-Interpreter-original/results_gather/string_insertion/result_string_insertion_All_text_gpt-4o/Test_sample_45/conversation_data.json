    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DDBCDECABCDCCDEA\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is performed from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to scan the string from left to right and identify the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions are done in the order the substrings are found, from left to right.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the string will change, and we need to keep track of these changes to ensure subsequent substrings are identified correctly.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- Start with the string: \"DDBCDECABCDCCDEA\"\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of a target substring from left to right.\n  - The first target substring is \"ABCD\" starting at index 7. According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\".\n  - The string becomes: \"DDBCDECABCDACCCDEA\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Continue scanning from the last insertion point.\n  - The next target substring is \"CDEA\" starting at index 12. According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n  - The string becomes: \"DDBCDECABCDACCCDEAC\"\n\n- **Step 3**: Continue scanning from the last insertion point.\n  - There are no more target substrings in the remaining part of the string.\n\nAfter applying the T operation once, the final string is \"DDBCDECABCDACCCDEAC\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<DDBCDECABCDACCCDEAC>>>"
