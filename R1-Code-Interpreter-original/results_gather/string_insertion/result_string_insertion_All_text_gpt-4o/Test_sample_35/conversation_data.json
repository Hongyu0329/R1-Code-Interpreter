    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEEABCCCDEAEBCDE\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. The operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is performed from left to right.\n\nLet's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: DEEABCCCDEAEBCDE\n\n2. **Check for Substring ABCD**:\n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for Substring BCDE**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 11 (0-based index). According to the rule, we insert 'B' after this substring.\n   - After insertion: DEEABCCCDEAEBCDBE\n\n4. **Check for Substring CDEA**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 7. According to the rule, we insert 'C' after this substring.\n   - After insertion: DEEABCCCDEACAEBCDBE\n\n5. **Check for Substring DEAB**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 1. According to the rule, we insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - After insertion: DEEABDCCCDEACAEBCDBE\n\n6. **Check for Substring EABC**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 3. According to the rule, we insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - After insertion: DEEABEDCCCDEACAEBCDBE\n\nAfter processing all the substrings from left to right, the final string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DEEABEDCCCDEACAEBCDBE>>>"
