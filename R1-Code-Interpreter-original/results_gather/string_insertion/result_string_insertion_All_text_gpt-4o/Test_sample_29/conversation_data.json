    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEAAEABCCBCDE\" and follow the rules for insertion carefully. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"CDEAAEABCCBCDE\".\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\": There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\": The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 10 (0-based index). According to rule 2, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes \"CDEAAEABCCBCDEB\".\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\": The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"CDEACAAEABCCBCDEB\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\": The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 3. According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"CDEACAAEABDCCBCDEB\".\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\": The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 6. According to rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"CDEACAAEABEDCCBCDEB\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all applicable insertions from left to right, the final string is \"CDEACAAEABEDCCBCDEB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<CDEACAAEABEDCCBCDEB>>>"
