    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDBCDEEDEAB\" and analyze each step carefully. The T operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is performed from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: DEABDBCDEEDEAB\n\n2. **Identify Substrings**:\n   - We need to look for the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the string.\n\n3. **Apply T Operation**:\n   - **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes: DEABDDBCDEEDEAB.\n   - **DBCDE**: The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 5. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes: DEABDDBCDEEBEDEAB.\n   - **EDEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 11. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes: DEABDDBCDEEBEDEABD.\n\n4. **Final String**:\n   - After applying the T operation from left to right, the final string is DEABDDBCDEEBEDEABD.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The final string should be returned in the format <<<a string>>>.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<DEABDDBCDEEBEDEABD>>>"
