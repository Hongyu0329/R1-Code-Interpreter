    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDBDEABEEABC\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all the substrings in the given string that match the patterns specified in the T operation rules. The substrings we are looking for are:\n   - ABCD\n   - BCDE\n   - CDEA\n   - DEAB\n   - EABC\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"ABCDBDEABEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\":\n     - Found at index 0-3 (\"ABCD\"), insert 'A' after it. The string becomes \"ABCDABDEABEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - Found at index 1-4 (\"BCDE\"), insert 'B' after it. The string becomes \"ABCDABCBDEABEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - Found at index 2-5 (\"CDEA\"), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"ABCDABCBDEACDEABEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n     - Found at index 5-8 (\"DEAB\"), insert 'D' after it. The string becomes \"ABCDABCBDEACDEADABEEABC\".\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\":\n     - Found at index 10-13 (\"EABC\"), insert 'E' after it. The string becomes \"ABCDABCBDEACDEADABEEABCE\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all the insertions from left to right, the final string is \"ABCDABCBDEACDEADABEEABCE\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ABCDABCBDEACDEADABEEABCE>>>"
