    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EABCCCDEAAABCD\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations to ensure that earlier insertions do not affect the positions of later substrings.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start with the string: \"EABCCCDEAAABCD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\":\n     - It appears at position 10 (0-based index), so we insert 'A' after it. The string becomes \"EABCCCDEAAABCAD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - It appears at position 5 (0-based index), so we insert 'B' after it. The string becomes \"EABCCCBDEAAABCAD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - It appears at position 6 (0-based index), so we insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"EABCCCBDEACAAABCAD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n     - It appears at position 7 (0-based index), so we insert 'D' after it. The string becomes \"EABCCCBDEACADAAABCAD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\":\n     - It appears at position 0 (0-based index), so we insert 'E' after it. The string becomes \"EAEABCCCBDEACADAAABCAD\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After processing all the substrings and applying the insertions, the final string is \"EAEABCCCBDEACADAAABCAD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<EAEABCCCBDEACADAAABCAD>>>"
