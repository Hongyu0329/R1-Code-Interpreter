    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABBEABCCABCDA\" and analyze it step by step. The T operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: DEABBEABCCABCDA\n\n2. **Check for Substring \"ABCD\"**:\n   - The substring \"ABCD\" appears at index 9 (0-based index). According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after \"ABCD\".\n   - After insertion: DEABBEABCCABCD**A**A\n\n3. **Check for Substring \"BCDE\"**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n4. **Check for Substring \"CDEA\"**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" does not appear in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n5. **Check for Substring \"DEAB\"**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" appears at index 0. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n   - After insertion: DEAB**D**BEABCCABCD**A**A\n\n6. **Check for Substring \"EABC\"**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" appears at index 5. According to rule 5, we insert 'E' after \"EABC\".\n   - After insertion: DEAB**D**BEABC**E**CABCD**A**A\n\nAfter performing all the insertions from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<DEABDBEABCECABCDDA>>>"
