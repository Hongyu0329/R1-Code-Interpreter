    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DBABCDDABCDACDEAA\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"DBABCDDABCDACDEAA\":\n\n- **Initial String**: DBABCDDABCDACDEAA\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of \"ABCD\":\n  - The first \"ABCD\" starts at index 3 (0-based index).\n  - Insert 'A' after this \"ABCD\", resulting in: DBABCD**A**DABCDACDEAA\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify the next occurrence of \"ABCD\":\n  - The next \"ABCD\" starts at index 9 (considering the previous insertion).\n  - Insert 'A' after this \"ABCD\", resulting in: DBABCDADABCD**A**ACDEAA\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify the occurrence of \"CDEA\":\n  - The \"CDEA\" starts at index 13 (considering previous insertions).\n  - Insert 'C' after this \"CDEA\", resulting in: DBABCDADABCDACDE**C**AA\n\n- **Step 4**: Check for other substrings:\n  - There are no occurrences of \"BCDE\", \"DEAB\", or \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nAfter applying the T operation, the final string is:\n\n<<<DBABCDADABCDACDECAA>>>"
