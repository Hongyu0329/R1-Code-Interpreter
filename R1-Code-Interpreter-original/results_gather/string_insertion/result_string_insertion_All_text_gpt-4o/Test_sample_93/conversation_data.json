    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEECDEAEEABCAE\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start with the initial string: \"BCDEECDEAEEABCAE\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - Found at index 0 (\"BCDE\"), insert 'B' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBECDEAEEABCAE\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the first \"BCDE\":\n     - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n       - Found at index 5 (\"CDEA\"), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBECDEACEEABCAE\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the first \"CDEA\":\n     - Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n       - Found at index 11 (\"DEAB\"), insert 'D' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBECDEACEEABDCAE\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the first \"DEAB\":\n     - Look for the substring \"EABC\":\n       - Found at index 13 (\"EABC\"), insert 'E' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBECDEACEEABEDCAE\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After processing all applicable substrings from left to right, the final string is \"BCDEBECDEACEEABEDCAE\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BCDEBECDEACEEABEDCAE>>>"
