    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABAEABCADEABED\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation:**\n   - For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Process the String:**\n   - Start from the leftmost part of the string and move to the right, applying the T operation as we find each substring.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - The string is \"ADEABAEABCADEABED\".\n   - Look for \"ABCD\": There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n   - Look for \"BCDE\": There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n   - Look for \"CDEA\": There is no \"CDEA\" in the string.\n   - Look for \"DEAB\": The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 2. According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"ADEABDAEABCADEABED\".\n   - Continue from the position after the inserted character.\n   - Look for \"DEAB\" again: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 11. Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"ADEABDAEABCADEABDED\".\n   - Look for \"EABC\": The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 7. According to rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"ADEABDAEABCAEDEABDED\".\n\n5. **Final String:**\n   - After processing the entire string from left to right, the final string after one T operation is \"ADEABDAEABCAEDEABDED\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<ADEABDAEABCAEDEABDED>>>"
