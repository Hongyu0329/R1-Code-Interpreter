    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEAECDEAAABCD\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all the substrings in the given string that match the patterns specified in the T operation rules. The substrings we are looking for are:\n   - ABCD\n   - BCDE\n   - CDEA\n   - DEAB\n   - EABC\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about the order of operations to ensure that earlier insertions do not affect the positions of later substrings.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"CDEAECDEAAABCD\"\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - Found at index 0-3 (\"CDEA\"), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"CDEACECDEAAABCD\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the inserted character:\n     - Look for the substring \"CDEA\" again:\n       - Found at index 5-8 (\"CDEA\"), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"CDEACECDEACAAABCD\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the inserted character:\n     - Look for the substring \"ABCD\":\n       - Found at index 12-15 (\"ABCD\"), insert 'A' after it. The string becomes \"CDEACECDEACAAABCAD\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all applicable T operations from left to right, the final string is \"CDEACECDEACAAABCAD\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<CDEACECDEACAAABCAD>>>"
