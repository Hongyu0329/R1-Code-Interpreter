    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDECCDEAACDEA\" and analyze each step carefully. The T operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The operation is performed from left to right.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BCDECCDEAACDEA\n\n2. **Identify Substrings**:\n   - We need to look for the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the string.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE)**:\n   - The first occurrence of the substring BCDE is at the very beginning of the string: \"BCDE\".\n   - According to Rule 2, after finding \"BCDE\", we insert the character 'B' immediately after it.\n   - The string becomes: BCDEBCCDEAACDEA\n\n4. **Continue from Left to Right**:\n   - After inserting 'B', continue scanning the string from where the insertion was made.\n   - The next part of the string is \"CCDEAACDEA\".\n\n5. **Apply Rule 3 (CDEA)**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at position 8 in the updated string: \"CCDEAACDEA\".\n   - According to Rule 3, after finding \"CDEA\", we insert the character 'C' immediately after it.\n   - The string becomes: BCDEBCCDEAACDEAC\n\n6. **Final String**:\n   - After applying the T operation once, the final string is: BCDEBCCDEAACDEAC\n\n7. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be formatted as <<<a string>>>.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<BCDEBCCDEAACDEAC>>>"
