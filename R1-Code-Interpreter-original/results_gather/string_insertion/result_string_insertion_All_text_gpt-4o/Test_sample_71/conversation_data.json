    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"BCDECCDEAECDEAAD\":\n\n- **BCDE**: The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDEAECDEAAD\".\n\n- **CDEA**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 6 (after the first insertion). According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDEACECDEAAD\".\n\n- **CDEA**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found again starting at index 11 (after the second insertion). According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDEACECDEACAD\".\n\nNow, let's format the final string as requested:\n\nThe final string after one operation T is <<<BCDEBCCDEACECDEACAD>>>."
