    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EABCBABCDCCDEAA\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n- **Initial String**: EABCBABCDCCDEAA\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for \"ABCD\". The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 5 (0-based index). According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes: EABCBABCADCCDEAA.\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for \"BCDE\". The substring \"BCDE\" is not present in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"CDEA\". The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 9. According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes: EABCBABCADCCDECAA.\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"DEAB\". The substring \"DEAB\" is not present in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"EABC\". The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 5, we insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes: EABCEBABCADCCDECAA.\n\nAfter applying all the rules from left to right, the final string is \"EABCEBABCADCCDECAA\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<EABCEBABCADCCDECAA>>>."
