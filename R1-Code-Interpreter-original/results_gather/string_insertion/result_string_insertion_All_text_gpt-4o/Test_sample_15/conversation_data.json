    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ECDEAACDEAEDEAB\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to adjust our search and insertion process accordingly.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"ECDEAACDEAEDEAB\":\n\n- **Initial String**: ECDEAACDEAEDEAB\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n  - Found at position 2 (0-based index), which is \"CDEA\" in \"ECDEAACDEAEDEAB\".\n  - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"ECDEACACDEAEDEAB\".\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for the substring \"CDEA\" again:\n  - Found at position 7 in the updated string \"ECDEACACDEAEDEAB\".\n  - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"ECDEACACDEACAEDEAB\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n  - Found at position 12 in the updated string \"ECDEACACDEACAEDEAB\".\n  - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"ECDEACACDEACAEDEADAB\".\n\n- **Step 4**: Check for other substrings:\n  - No \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", or \"EABC\" are found in the updated string.\n\nAfter applying the T operation, the final string is \"ECDEACACDEACAEDEADAB\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<ECDEACACDEACAEDEADAB>>>"
