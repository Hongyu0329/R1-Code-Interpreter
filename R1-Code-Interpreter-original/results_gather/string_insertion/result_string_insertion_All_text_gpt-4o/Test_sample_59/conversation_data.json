    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\" by checking each of the specified substrings and inserting the corresponding character after each occurrence. The operation is performed from left to right, meaning we should process the string in a linear fashion and apply the insertions as we find the substrings.\n\nLet's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: ADEABEDEABBEABCBE\n\n2. **Check for Substring ABCD**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n3. **Check for Substring BCDE**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n4. **Check for Substring CDEA**: \n   - There is no occurrence of \"CDEA\" in the string.\n\n5. **Check for Substring DEAB**: \n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 3 (ADEAB). According to the rule, we insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - After insertion: ADEABDEDEABBEABCBE\n\n6. **Check for Substring EABC**: \n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 11 (EABC). According to the rule, we insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - After insertion: ADEABDEDEABBEABCEBE\n\nNow, we have processed the string from left to right and applied the T operation as specified. The final string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ADEABDEDEABBEABCEBE>>>"
