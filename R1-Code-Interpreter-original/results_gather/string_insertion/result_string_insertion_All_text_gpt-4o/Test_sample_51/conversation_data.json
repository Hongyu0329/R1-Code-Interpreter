    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EDDEABDABCDBBCDEC\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find all occurrences of the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1**: Look for the substring ABCD.\n   - The string \"EDDEABDABCDBBCDEC\" contains \"ABCD\" starting at index 6 (0-based index).\n   - According to Rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEC\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2**: Look for the substring BCDE.\n   - The string \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEC\" contains \"BCDE\" starting at index 11.\n   - According to Rule 2, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEBC\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3**: Look for the substring CDEA.\n   - The string \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEBC\" contains \"CDEA\" starting at index 13.\n   - According to Rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEABCC\".\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4**: Look for the substring DEAB.\n   - The string \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEABCC\" contains \"DEAB\" starting at index 3.\n   - According to Rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEABCC\".\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5**: Look for the substring EABC.\n   - The string \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEABCC\" contains \"EABC\" starting at index 4.\n   - According to Rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEABCC\".\n\n7. **Final String**: After applying all the rules from left to right, the final string is \"EDDEABDABCDABBCDEABCC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<EDDEABDABCDABBCDEABCC>>>"
