    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ECDEAAEABCBDEAB\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, meaning we should process the string from the beginning to the end and apply each insertion as we encounter the substring.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the string will change, and we need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are applied to the updated string.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- **Initial String**: ECDEAAEABCBDEAB\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify and apply the T operation from left to right.\n\n  - **Substring CDEA**: Found at index 1 (0-based index). According to rule 3, insert 'C' after CDEA.\n    - New string: ECDECAAEABCBDEAB\n\n  - **Substring DEAB**: Found at index 8 (after the first insertion). According to rule 4, insert 'D' after DEAB.\n    - New string: ECDECAAEABCDCBDEAB\n\n- **Final String**: After processing all possible substrings from left to right, the resulting string is ECDECAAEABCDCBDEAB.\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ECDECAAEABCDCBDEAB>>>"
