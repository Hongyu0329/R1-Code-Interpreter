    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DAEABCBEABCCEABC\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"DAEABCBEABCCEABC\":\n\n- **Initial String**: DAEABCBEABCCEABC\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify substrings and apply insertions from left to right.\n\n  - **EABC**: Found at index 2 (DAEABC). According to rule 5, insert 'E' after EABC.\n    - New string: DAEABECBEABCCEABC\n\n  - **EABC**: Found again at index 10 (EABCCEABC). According to rule 5, insert 'E' after EABC.\n    - New string: DAEABECBEABCCEABEC\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is \"DAEABECBEABCCEABEC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DAEABECBEABCCEABEC>>>"
