    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\":\n\n- **Initial String**: EAABCDCABCDACDEAC\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for \"ABCD\":\n  - Found at index 3 (\"ABCD\" starts at index 3). Insert 'A' after it.\n  - Found at index 7 (\"ABCD\" starts at index 7). Insert 'A' after it.\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for \"BCDE\":\n  - Found at index 11 (\"BCDE\" starts at index 11). Insert 'B' after it.\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"CDEA\":\n  - Found at index 12 (\"CDEA\" starts at index 12). Insert 'C' after it.\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"DEAB\":\n  - Not found in the string.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"EABC\":\n  - Found at index 0 (\"EABC\" starts at index 0). Insert 'E' after it.\n\nNow, let's apply these insertions in order:\n\n1. Insert 'E' after \"EABC\" at index 0: \n   - Result: \"EABECABCDCABCDACDEAC\"\n\n2. Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\" at index 3:\n   - Result: \"EABECABCDACABCDACDEAC\"\n\n3. Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\" at index 7:\n   - Result: \"EABECABCDACABCDACDEAC\"\n\n4. Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\" at index 11:\n   - Result: \"EABECABCDACABCDABDEAC\"\n\n5. Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\" at index 12:\n   - Result: \"EABECABCDACABCDABDEAC\"\n\nAfter applying all the insertions, the final string is \"EABECABCDACABCDABDEAC\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<EABECABCDACABCDABDEAC>>>"
