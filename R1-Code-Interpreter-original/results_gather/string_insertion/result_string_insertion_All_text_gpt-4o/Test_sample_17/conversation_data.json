    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABADEABEDEABB\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find all occurrences of the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB)**: \n   - The substring \"DEAB\" appears in the string starting at index 3 (ADEABADEABEDEABB). According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after this substring. The string becomes \"ADEABDADEABEDEABB\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 4 Again (DEAB)**:\n   - After the first insertion, the substring \"DEAB\" appears again starting at index 9 (ADEABDADEABEDEABB). We insert 'D' after this substring. The string becomes \"ADEABDADEABDEDEABB\".\n\n4. **Check for Other Substrings**:\n   - There are no occurrences of the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, or EABC in the string, so no other insertions are made.\n\n5. **Final String**: After applying the T operation, the final string is \"ADEABDADEABDEDEABB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ADEABDADEABDEDEABB>>>"
