    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AAABCDBBCDEECDEAD\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we make insertions, the string will change, and we need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n- **Initial String**: AAABCDBBCDEECDEAD\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for \"ABCD\"\n  - Found at position 2: \"AA[ABCD]BBCDEECDEAD\"\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\": Resulting string becomes \"AAABCDABBCDEECDEAD\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for \"BCDE\"\n  - Found at position 9: \"AAABCDABB[BCDE]ECDEAD\"\n  - Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\": Resulting string becomes \"AAABCDABBCDEBECDEAD\"\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"CDEA\"\n  - Found at position 13: \"AAABCDABBCDEB[CDEA]D\"\n  - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\": Resulting string becomes \"AAABCDABBCDEBECDEACD\"\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"DEAB\"\n  - No occurrence of \"DEAB\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"EABC\"\n  - No occurrence of \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nAfter applying all applicable insertions, the final string is \"AAABCDABBCDEBECDEACD\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<AAABCDABBCDEBECDEACD>>>"
