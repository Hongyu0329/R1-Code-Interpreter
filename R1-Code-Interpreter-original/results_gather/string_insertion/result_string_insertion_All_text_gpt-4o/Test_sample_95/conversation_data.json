    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AADEABEDEABECDEA\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to scan the string from left to right to identify any of the specified substrings: ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions are done from left to right, meaning that once a character is inserted, it affects the position of subsequent characters and substrings.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start with the string: \"AADEABEDEABECDEA\".\n   - Scan for the substrings in the order they appear in the string.\n\n4. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - **Initial String**: AADEABEDEABECDEA\n   - **Scan for Substrings**:\n     - No \"ABCD\" is found.\n     - No \"BCDE\" is found.\n     - **CDEA** is found starting at index 11 (CDEA).\n       - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in: \"AADEABEDEABECDEAC\".\n     - **DEAB** is found starting at index 7 (DEAB).\n       - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in: \"AADEABEDEABDECDEAC\".\n     - **EABC** is found starting at index 9 (EABC).\n       - Insert 'E' after \"EABC\", resulting in: \"AADEABEDEABDECEDEAC\".\n\n5. **Final String**: After processing all applicable substrings from left to right, the final string is \"AADEABEDEABDECEDEAC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<AADEABEDEABDECEDEAC>>>"
