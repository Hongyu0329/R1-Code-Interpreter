    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"AAABCDBDEABADEAB\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:**\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\". In the string \"AAABCDBDEABADEAB\", the substring \"ABCD\" starts at index 2 (0-based index). According to Rule 1, we insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"AAABCDABDEABADEAB\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2:**\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\". In the updated string \"AAABCDABDEABADEAB\", the substring \"BCDE\" starts at index 4. According to Rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes \"AAABCDABDEBABADEAB\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3:**\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\". In the updated string \"AAABCDABDEBABADEAB\", the substring \"CDEA\" starts at index 5. According to Rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"AAABCDABDEBACABADEAB\".\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4:**\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\". In the updated string \"AAABCDABDEBACABADEAB\", the substring \"DEAB\" starts at index 8. According to Rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"AAABCDABDEBACABADEABDEAB\".\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5:**\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\". In the updated string \"AAABCDABDEBACABADEABDEAB\", the substring \"EABC\" starts at index 10. According to Rule 5, we insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"AAABCDABDEBACABADEABDEABCEAB\".\n\n7. **Final String:**\n   - After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is \"AAABCDABDEBACABADEABDEABCEAB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<AAABCDABDEBACABADEABDEABCEAB>>>"
