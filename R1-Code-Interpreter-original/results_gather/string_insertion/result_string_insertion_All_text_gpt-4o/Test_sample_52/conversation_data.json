    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BBCDEBDEABADEABBA\n\n2. **Identify Substrings**:\n   - We need to look for the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the string.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE)**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 1 (BBCDE...).\n   - According to Rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n   - The string becomes: BB**BCDEB**DEABADEABBA\n\n4. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB)**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 8 (BBBCDEB**DEAB**...).\n   - According to Rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n   - The string becomes: BBBCDEBBDEAB**D**ADEABBA\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB) Again**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found again starting at index 12 (BBBCDEBBDEABDA**DEAB**...).\n   - According to Rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n   - The string becomes: BBBCDEBBDEABDADEAB**D**BA\n\n6. **Final String**:\n   - After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is: BBBCDEBBDEABDADEABDDBA\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is: <<<BBBCDEBBDEABDADEABDDBA>>>"
