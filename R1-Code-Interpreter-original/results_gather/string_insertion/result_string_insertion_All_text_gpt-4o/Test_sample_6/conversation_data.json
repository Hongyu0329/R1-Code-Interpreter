    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DAEABCAEABCCEABC\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: Start with the string \"DAEABCAEABCCEABC\".\n\n2. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the string.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 1 (ABCD)**: \n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\". In the given string, there is no occurrence of \"ABCD\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE)**:\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\". In the given string, there is no occurrence of \"BCDE\".\n\n5. **Apply Rule 3 (CDEA)**:\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\". In the given string, there is no occurrence of \"CDEA\".\n\n6. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB)**:\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\". In the given string, there is no occurrence of \"DEAB\".\n\n7. **Apply Rule 5 (EABC)**:\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\". In the given string, \"EABC\" occurs at index 11 (0-based index).\n   - According to the rule, insert the character 'E' after this substring.\n   - After inserting 'E', the string becomes \"DAEABCAEABCCEABEC\".\n\n8. **Final String**: After applying the T operation, the resulting string is \"DAEABCAEABCCEABEC\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<DAEABCAEABCCEABEC>>>"
