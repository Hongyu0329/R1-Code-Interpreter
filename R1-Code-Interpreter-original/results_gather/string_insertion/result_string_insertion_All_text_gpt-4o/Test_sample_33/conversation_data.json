    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABEEABCADEAB\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. Therefore, we need to carefully track the positions and ensure that each insertion is done correctly.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"DEABEEABCADEAB\":\n\n- **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found at index 0. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"DEABDEEABCADEAB\".\n\n- **EABC**: After the first insertion, the substring \"EABC\" is found at index 5. According to rule 5, we insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"DEABDEEABCEADEAB\".\n\n- **DEAB**: After the second insertion, the substring \"DEAB\" is found at index 10. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"DEABDEEABCEADEABD\".\n\nNow, let's format the final string as requested:\n\nThe final string after one operation T is <<<DEABDEEABCEADEABD>>>."
