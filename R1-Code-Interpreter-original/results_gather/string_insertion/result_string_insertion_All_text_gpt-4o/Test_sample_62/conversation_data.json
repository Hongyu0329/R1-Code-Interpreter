    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDEACBCDECEABCAA\" and insert characters according to the rules specified. We will analyze the string step by step, checking for each of the specified substrings and performing the insertions as required.\n\n1. **Initial String**: CDEACBCDECEABCAA\n\n2. **Check for Substring ABCD**:\n   - There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string, so no insertion of 'A' is needed.\n\n3. **Check for Substring BCDE**:\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 5 (CDEAC**BCDE**CEABCAA).\n   - According to the rule, insert 'B' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: CDEACBCDEBCEABCAA\n\n4. **Check for Substring CDEA**:\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 0 (**CDEA**CBCDECEABCAA).\n   - According to the rule, insert 'C' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: CDEACBCDEBCEABCAA\n\n5. **Check for Substring DEAB**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 9 (CDEACBCDEBCE**DEAB**CAA).\n   - According to the rule, insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: CDEACBCDEBCEDEABDCAA\n\n6. **Check for Substring EABC**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 11 (CDEACBCDEBCEDEAB**EABC**AA).\n   - According to the rule, insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: CDEACBCDEBCEDEABEABCEAA\n\n7. **Final String**: After applying all the rules from left to right, the final string is \"CDEACBCDEBCEDEABEABCEAA\".\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<CDEACBCDEBCEDEABEABCEAA>>>"
