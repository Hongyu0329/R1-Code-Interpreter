    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\":\n\n- **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"DEABD\".\n\n- **ECDE**: The substring \"ECDE\" is found starting at index 4. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"ECDE\", resulting in \"ECDEB\".\n\n- **CDEA**: The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 5 (after the first insertion). According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"CDEAC\".\n\n- **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 10 (after the previous insertions). According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"DEABD\".\n\nNow, let's construct the final string after all insertions:\n\n- Start with the original string: \"DEABECDEAADEABDD\"\n- After inserting 'D' after the first \"DEAB\": \"DEABD ECDEAADEABDD\"\n- After inserting 'B' after \"ECDE\": \"DEABD ECDEB AADEABDD\"\n- After inserting 'C' after \"CDEA\": \"DEABD ECDEB A C ADEABDD\"\n- After inserting 'D' after the second \"DEAB\": \"DEABD ECDEB A C ADEABD D\"\n\nCombining all parts, the final string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DEABDECDEBACADEABDD>>>"
