    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDBDEABAABCD\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. Therefore, we need to carefully track the positions and ensure that each insertion is done correctly.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"ABCDBDEABAABCD\":\n\n- **Initial String**: ABCDBDEABAABCD\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of \"ABCD\":\n  - Found at index 0 (substring \"ABCD\" from index 0 to 3).\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\", resulting in: \"ABCDA\" + \"BDEABAABCD\".\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify the next occurrence of \"ABCD\":\n  - Found at index 10 (substring \"ABCD\" from index 10 to 13).\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\", resulting in: \"ABCDA\" + \"BDEABA\" + \"ABCD\" + \"A\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify the occurrence of \"BCDE\":\n  - No occurrence of \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 4**: Identify the occurrence of \"CDEA\":\n  - No occurrence of \"CDEA\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 5**: Identify the occurrence of \"DEAB\":\n  - Found at index 5 (substring \"DEAB\" from index 5 to 8).\n  - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in: \"ABCDA\" + \"BDEABD\" + \"A\" + \"BAABCD\" + \"A\".\n\n- **Step 6**: Identify the occurrence of \"EABC\":\n  - No occurrence of \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nAfter applying all applicable insertions, the final string is:\n\n- **Final String**: \"ABCDA\" + \"BDEABD\" + \"A\" + \"BAABCD\" + \"A\"\n\nCombining these parts, the final string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ABCDABDEABDABAABCDA>>>"
