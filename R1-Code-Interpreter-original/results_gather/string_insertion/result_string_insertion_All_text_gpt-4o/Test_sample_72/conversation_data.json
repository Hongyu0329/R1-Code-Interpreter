    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADBCDEBEABCCBCDEBB\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: ADBCDEBEABCCBCDEBB\n\n2. **Rule 1**: Look for the substring \"ABCD\" and insert \"A\" after it.\n   - The substring \"ABCD\" is not present in the string.\n\n3. **Rule 2**: Look for the substring \"BCDE\" and insert \"B\" after it.\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is present starting at index 3 (0-based index). After inserting \"B\", the string becomes: ADBCDEBEBABCCBCDEBB\n\n4. **Rule 3**: Look for the substring \"CDEA\" and insert \"C\" after it.\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" is not present in the string.\n\n5. **Rule 4**: Look for the substring \"DEAB\" and insert \"D\" after it.\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is present starting at index 6 (0-based index). After inserting \"D\", the string becomes: ADBCDEBEBABCCBCDEDBB\n\n6. **Rule 5**: Look for the substring \"EABC\" and insert \"E\" after it.\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is present starting at index 8 (0-based index). After inserting \"E\", the string becomes: ADBCDEBEBABCCBCDEDBB\n\n7. **Final String**: After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is: ADBCDEBEBABCCBCDEDBB\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is: <<<ADBCDEBEBABCCBCDEDBB>>>"
