    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DCABCDDABCDCABCDBB\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:**\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\". In the given string, \"ABCD\" appears at index 3 (0-based index) and again at index 10.\n   - According to Rule 1, insert 'A' after each occurrence of \"ABCD\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2:**\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\". There is no occurrence of \"BCDE\" in the given string.\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3:**\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\". There is no occurrence of \"CDEA\" in the given string.\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4:**\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\". There is no occurrence of \"DEAB\" in the given string.\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5:**\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\". There is no occurrence of \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n7. **Perform Insertions:**\n   - Insert 'A' after the first occurrence of \"ABCD\" at index 3, resulting in \"DCABCDACDDABCDCABCDBB\".\n   - Insert 'A' after the second occurrence of \"ABCD\" at index 10 (considering the previous insertion), resulting in \"DCABCDACDDABCDACBCDBB\".\n\n8. **Final String:**\n   - After applying the T operation, the final string is \"DCABCDACDDABCDACBCDBB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DCABCDACDDABCDACBCDBB>>>"
