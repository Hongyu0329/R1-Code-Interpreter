    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EDCDEADBCDEEEABCBC\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to look for the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation:**\n   - For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Process the String from Left to Right:**\n   - We must process the string from left to right, ensuring that any changes made do not affect the identification of subsequent substrings.\n\nLet's go through the string:\n\n- **Initial String:** EDCDEADBCDEEEABCBC\n\n- **Step 1:** Look for \"ABCD\":\n  - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 2:** Look for \"BCDE\":\n  - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 7 (i.e., \"ADBCDE\").\n  - Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\", resulting in \"EDCDEADB**BCDE**BEEABCBC\".\n\n- **Step 3:** Look for \"CDEA\":\n  - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 2 (i.e., \"EDCDEA\").\n  - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\", resulting in \"EDCDE**AC**DEADBBCDEBEEABCBC\".\n\n- **Step 4:** Look for \"DEAB\":\n  - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 4 (i.e., \"CDEAD**DEAB**\").\n  - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in \"EDCDEACDE**AD**BBCDEBEEABCBC\".\n\n- **Step 5:** Look for \"EABC\":\n  - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 14 (i.e., \"EEAB**EABC**\").\n  - Insert 'E' after \"EABC\", resulting in \"EDCDEACDEADBBCDEBEE**EABC**EBC\".\n\nAfter processing all the substrings from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<EDCDEACDEADBBCDEBEEABCEBC>>>"
