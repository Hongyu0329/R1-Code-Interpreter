    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABDABCDADEAB\" and determine the resulting string. Let's analyze the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all the substrings in the given string that match the patterns specified in the T operation rules. The substrings we are looking for are \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\".\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1**: Look for the substring \"ABCD\". In the given string \"DEABDABCDADEAB\", the substring \"ABCD\" appears starting at index 4 (0-based index). According to Rule 1, we insert the character 'A' after this substring. The string becomes \"DEABDABCD**A**ADEAB\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2**: Look for the substring \"BCDE\". In the current string \"DEABDABCD**A**ADEAB\", there is no occurrence of \"BCDE\". So, no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3**: Look for the substring \"CDEA\". In the current string \"DEABDABCD**A**ADEAB\", there is no occurrence of \"CDEA\". So, no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4**: Look for the substring \"DEAB\". In the current string \"DEABDABCD**A**ADEAB\", the substring \"DEAB\" appears starting at index 0 and again starting at index 10. According to Rule 4, we insert the character 'D' after each occurrence of this substring. The string becomes \"DEAB**D**DABCD**A**ADEAB**D**\".\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5**: Look for the substring \"EABC\". In the current string \"DEAB**D**DABCD**A**ADEAB**D**\", there is no occurrence of \"EABC\". So, no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n7. **Final String**: After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is \"DEAB**D**DABCD**A**ADEAB**D**\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DEABDDABCDAADEABD>>>"
