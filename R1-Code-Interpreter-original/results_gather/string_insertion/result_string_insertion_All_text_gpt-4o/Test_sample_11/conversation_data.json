    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"ACDEAADEABAABCD\".\n   - Check for the substring \"ABCD\":\n     - The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 11 (0-based index).\n     - According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\".\n     - The string becomes: \"ACDEAADEABAABCD**A**\".\n   - Check for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n   - Check for the substring \"CDEA\":\n     - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 1.\n     - According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n     - The string becomes: \"A**CDEAC**AADEABAABCD**A**\".\n   - Check for the substring \"DEAB\":\n     - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 6.\n     - According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n     - The string becomes: \"A**CDEAC**AA**DEABD**EABAABCD**A**\".\n   - Check for the substring \"EABC\":\n     - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 9.\n     - According to rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\".\n     - The string becomes: \"A**CDEAC**AA**DEABD**EAB**E**AABCD**A**\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all the insertions, the final string is \"ACDEACADEABDEABEABCD**A**\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ACDEACADEABDEABEABCDA>>>"
