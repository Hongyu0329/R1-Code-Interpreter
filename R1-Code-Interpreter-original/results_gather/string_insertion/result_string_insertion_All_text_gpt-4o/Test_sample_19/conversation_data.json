    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEEEABCCEABCC\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings for Insertion:**\n   - We need to scan the string from left to right to identify the substrings that match the patterns specified in the T operation rules.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE):**\n   - The string \"BCDEEEABCCEABCC\" contains the substring \"BCDE\" starting at index 0.\n   - According to Rule 2, we insert the character 'B' after this substring.\n   - After insertion, the string becomes \"BCDEBEEABCCEABCC\".\n\n3. **Continue Scanning for Other Substrings:**\n   - After inserting 'B', continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character.\n   - The next potential substring to check is \"EEAB\" starting at index 5, which does not match any rule.\n   - Continue scanning further.\n\n4. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB):**\n   - The string \"BCDEBEEABCCEABCC\" contains the substring \"DEAB\" starting at index 6.\n   - According to Rule 4, we insert the character 'D' after this substring.\n   - After insertion, the string becomes \"BCDEBEEABDCCEABCC\".\n\n5. **Continue Scanning for Other Substrings:**\n   - After inserting 'D', continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character.\n   - The next potential substring to check is \"CCEAB\" starting at index 11, which does not match any rule.\n   - Continue scanning further.\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5 (EABC):**\n   - The string \"BCDEBEEABDCCEABCC\" contains the substring \"EABC\" starting at index 12.\n   - According to Rule 5, we insert the character 'E' after this substring.\n   - After insertion, the string becomes \"BCDEBEEABDCCEABECC\".\n\n7. **Final Result:**\n   - After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is \"BCDEBEEABDCCEABECC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BCDEBEEABDCCEABECC>>>"
