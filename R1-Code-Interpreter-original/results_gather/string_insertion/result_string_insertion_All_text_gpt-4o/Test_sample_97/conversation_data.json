    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CDDEABBEABCCBCDEDC\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to look for the specific substrings: ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1 (ABCD):**\n   - Search for the substring \"ABCD\" in the string. In this case, \"ABCD\" is not present in the string, so no insertion is made for this rule.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE):**\n   - Search for the substring \"BCDE\" in the string. The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 12 (0-based index). According to the rule, we insert 'B' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: \"CDDEABBEABCCBCDEBDC\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3 (CDEA):**\n   - Search for the substring \"CDEA\" in the string. The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 2. According to the rule, we insert 'C' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: \"CDDEACBBEABCCBCDEBDC\".\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB):**\n   - Search for the substring \"DEAB\" in the string. The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 3. According to the rule, we insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: \"CDDEACDBBEABCCBCDEBDC\".\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5 (EABC):**\n   - Search for the substring \"EABC\" in the string. The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 7. According to the rule, we insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes: \"CDDEACDBBEABCECCBCDEBDC\".\n\n7. **Final String:**\n   - After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is \"CDDEACDBBEABCECCBCDEBDC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<CDDEACDBBEABCECCBCDEBDC>>>"
