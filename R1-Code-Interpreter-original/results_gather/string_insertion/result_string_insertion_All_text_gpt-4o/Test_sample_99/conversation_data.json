    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CADEABACDEADCDEAED\" and determine the resulting string. Let's analyze the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change, so we need to carefully track the changes in the string.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the T operation:\n\n- **Initial String**: CADEABACDEADCDEAED\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for \"ABCD\". There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for \"BCDE\". There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"CDEA\". The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 9 (0-based index). According to the rule, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes: CADEABACDEACDCDEAED.\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"DEAB\". The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 3. According to the rule, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes: CADEDABACDEACDCDEAED.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"EABC\". There is no \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nAfter applying all the rules, the final string after one T operation is \"CADEDABACDEACDCDEAED\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<CADEDABACDEACDCDEAED>>>."
