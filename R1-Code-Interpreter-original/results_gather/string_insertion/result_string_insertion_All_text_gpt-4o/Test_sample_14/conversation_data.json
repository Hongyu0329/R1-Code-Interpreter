    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEEBCDECABCDDD\" and analyze it step by step. The T operation involves checking for specific substrings and inserting a character immediately after each occurrence of these substrings. The insertions are done from left to right, which means we need to be careful about how the string changes as we perform each insertion.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BCDEEBCDECABCDDD\n\n2. **Identify Substrings and Insertions**:\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\". In the given string, \"ABCD\" appears at position 10 (0-based index). According to rule 1, we insert 'A' after \"ABCD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\". In the given string, \"BCDE\" appears at position 1. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\". In the given string, \"CDEA\" appears at position 6. According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\". In the given string, \"DEAB\" does not appear.\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\". In the given string, \"EABC\" does not appear.\n\n3. **Perform Insertions from Left to Right**:\n   - First, insert 'B' after the first occurrence of \"BCDE\" at position 1. The string becomes: BCDEBEEBCDECABCDDD\n   - Next, insert 'C' after the first occurrence of \"CDEA\" at position 6. The string becomes: BCDEBEEBCDECAABCDDD\n   - Finally, insert 'A' after the first occurrence of \"ABCD\" at position 10. The string becomes: BCDEBEEBCDECAABCDADD\n\n4. **Final String**: After performing all the insertions, the final string is \"BCDEBEEBCDECAABCDADD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BCDEBEEBCDECAABCDADD>>>"
