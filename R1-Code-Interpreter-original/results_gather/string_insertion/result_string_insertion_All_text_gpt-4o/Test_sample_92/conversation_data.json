    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCCDEAAEABCCCDEAD\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find all occurrences of the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1**: Look for the substring ABCD. In the given string, there is no occurrence of ABCD.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2**: Look for the substring BCDE. The substring BCDE is found starting at index 1 (BCCDE). According to the rule, we insert the character B after this substring. The string becomes \"BCCDEB...\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3**: Look for the substring CDEA. The substring CDEA is found starting at index 11 (CCCDEAD). According to the rule, we insert the character C after this substring. The string becomes \"BCCDEB...C...\".\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4**: Look for the substring DEAB. The substring DEAB is found starting at index 7 (DEAAEAB). According to the rule, we insert the character D after this substring. The string becomes \"BCCDEB...C...D...\".\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5**: Look for the substring EABC. The substring EABC is found starting at index 8 (EAAEABCCCDEAD). According to the rule, we insert the character E after this substring. The string becomes \"BCCDEB...C...D...E...\".\n\n7. **String Insertion**: Insert the characters in the order they are found from left to right. The final string after applying all insertions is \"BCCDEBAAEABCCCDEACD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BCCDEBAAEABCCCDEACD>>>"
