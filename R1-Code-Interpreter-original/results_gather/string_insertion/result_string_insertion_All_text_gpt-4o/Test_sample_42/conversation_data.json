    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EABCCEABCACDEA\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"EABCCEABCACDEA\":\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the substrings:\n  - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 4.\n  - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 9.\n\n- **Step 2**: Apply the insertions:\n  - For the substring \"EABC\" at index 4, insert 'E' after it. The string becomes \"EABCCEABCEACDEA\".\n  - For the substring \"CDEA\" at index 9 (original index before any insertions), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"EABCCEABCEACDEAC\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Ensure correct order of operations:\n  - The insertions are done from left to right, and since \"EABC\" is found before \"CDEA\", the order of operations is correct.\n\nAfter applying the T operation, the final string is \"EABCCEABCEACDEAC\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<EABCCEABCEACDEAC>>>"
