    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBCDECBCDEECDEA\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we proceed.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"BBCDECBCDEECDEA\".\n   - Look for the substring \"ABCD\": There is no occurrence of \"ABCD\" in the string.\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\": The substring \"BCDE\" appears twice:\n     - First occurrence: \"BCDE\" starts at index 1 (0-based index). According to the rule, insert 'B' after this substring. The string becomes \"BBCDEBCDECBCDEECDEA\".\n     - Second occurrence: After the first insertion, the next \"BCDE\" starts at index 8. Insert 'B' after this substring. The string becomes \"BBCDEBCDEBCDECBCDEECDEA\".\n   - Look for the substring \"CDEA\": The substring \"CDEA\" appears once:\n     - Occurrence: \"CDEA\" starts at index 14. Insert 'C' after this substring. The string becomes \"BBCDEBCDEBCDECBCDEECDEACDEA\".\n   - Look for the substring \"DEAB\": There is no occurrence of \"DEAB\" in the string.\n   - Look for the substring \"EABC\": There is no occurrence of \"EABC\" in the string.\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all applicable insertions, the final string is \"BBCDEBCDEBCDECBCDEECDEACDEA\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BBCDEBCDEBCDECBCDEECDEACDEA>>>"
