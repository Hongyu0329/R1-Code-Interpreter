    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADEABBABCDAEABCBD\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to look for the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation:**\n   - For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Process the String:**\n   - Start from the leftmost part of the string and move to the right, applying the T operation as soon as a matching substring is found.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - The given string is \"ADEABBABCDAEABCBD\".\n   - Check for \"ABCD\": The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 6 (\"ABBABCDAEABCBD\"). According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"ADEABBABCD**A**AEABCBD\".\n   - Check for \"BCDE\": No \"BCDE\" is found in the string.\n   - Check for \"CDEA\": No \"CDEA\" is found in the string.\n   - Check for \"DEAB\": The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 1 (\"DEABBABCDAEABCBD\"). According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"A**DEABD**BABCDAEABCBD\".\n   - Check for \"EABC\": The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 10 (\"EABCBD\"). According to rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"ADEABDBABCDA**E**EABCBD\".\n\n5. **Final String:**\n   - After applying all applicable T operations from left to right, the final string is \"ADEABDBABCDAE**E**ABCBD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ADEABDBABCDAEEABCBD>>>"
