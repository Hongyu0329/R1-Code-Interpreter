    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ACEABCBEABCBBCDEE\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to look for the specific substrings: ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation:**\n   - For each identified substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n   - The insertions should be done from left to right, meaning that once a character is inserted, it affects the positions of subsequent characters.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they appear.\n   - As we find a substring, perform the insertion and continue scanning the string from the point of insertion.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The string is \"ACEABCBEABCBBCDEE\".\n   - Scan for the substrings:\n     - **EABC** is found starting at index 2 (ACEABC). According to rule 5, insert 'E' after EABC. The string becomes \"ACEEABCBEABCBBCDEE\".\n     - Continue scanning from the position after the inserted 'E'.\n     - **DEAB** is found starting at index 13 (ACEEABCBEABCBBCDEE). According to rule 4, insert 'D' after DEAB. The string becomes \"ACEEABCBEABCBBCDEDE\".\n   - No other substrings match the criteria after these insertions.\n\n5. **Final String:**\n   - After applying the T operation once, the final string is \"ACEEABCBEABCBBCDEDE\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<ACEEABCBEABCBBCDEDE>>>"
