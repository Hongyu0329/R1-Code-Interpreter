    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CCDEAACDEAEDEAB\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start with the initial string: \"CCDEAACDEAEDEAB\".\n   - Scan the string from left to right to find the substrings and apply the insertions.\n\n4. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - **Initial String**: \"CCDEAACDEAEDEAB\"\n   - **Scan for Substrings**:\n     - The first substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 4. According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"CCDEAACDEACAEDEAB\".\n     - Next, \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 10. According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"CCDEAACDEACAEDEADAB\".\n   - No other specified substrings are found in the string after these insertions.\n\n5. **Final String**: After processing all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is \"CCDEAACDEACAEDEADAB\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<CCDEAACDEACAEDEADAB>>>"
