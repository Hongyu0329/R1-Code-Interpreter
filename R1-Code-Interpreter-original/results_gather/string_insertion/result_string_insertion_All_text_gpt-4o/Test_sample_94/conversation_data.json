    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CCDEAACDEACEABCBD\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the indices of the string will change. We need to adjust our search for substrings accordingly.\n\nLet's go through the string step by step:\n\n- **Initial String**: \"CCDEAACDEACEABCBD\"\n\n- **Step 1**: Look for \"ABCD\". There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 2**: Look for \"BCDE\". There is no \"BCDE\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 3**: Look for \"CDEA\". The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 5 (0-based index). According to the rule, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"CCDEAACDEACCEABCBD\".\n\n- **Step 4**: Look for \"DEAB\". There is no \"DEAB\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 5**: Look for \"EABC\". The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 11 (0-based index, considering the previous insertion). According to the rule, we insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"CCDEAACDEACCEABECBD\".\n\nAfter applying the T operation from left to right, the final string is \"CCDEAACDEACCEABECBD\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<CCDEAACDEACCEABECBD>>>"
