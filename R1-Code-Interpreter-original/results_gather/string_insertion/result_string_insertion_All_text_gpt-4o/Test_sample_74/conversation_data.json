    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CBABCDADEABBABCD\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply these steps:\n\n- **Initial String**: CBABCDADEABBABCD\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"ABCD\".\n  - Found at index 4 (0-based index).\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\", resulting in: CBABCDAADEABBABCD\n\n- **Step 2**: Continue from the last insertion point and identify the next occurrence of \"ABCD\".\n  - Found at index 13 (0-based index, considering the previous insertion).\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\", resulting in: CBABCDAADEABBABCAD\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"DEAB\".\n  - Found at index 8 (0-based index, considering previous insertions).\n  - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\", resulting in: CBABCDAADEABDBABCAD\n\n- **Step 4**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"EABC\".\n  - Found at index 10 (0-based index, considering previous insertions).\n  - Insert 'E' after \"EABC\", resulting in: CBABCDAADEABDEBABCAD\n\n- **Step 5**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"BCDE\".\n  - No occurrence found in the string.\n\n- **Step 6**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"CDEA\".\n  - No occurrence found in the string.\n\nAfter applying all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<CBABCDAADEABDEBABCAD>>>"
