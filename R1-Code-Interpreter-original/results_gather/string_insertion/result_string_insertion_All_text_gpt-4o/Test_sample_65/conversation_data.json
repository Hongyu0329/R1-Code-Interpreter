    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BBBCDEBABCDDABCDD\" and determine the resulting string after one complete pass of the operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, meaning we should process the string in a single pass and apply each insertion as we encounter the substring.\n\n3. **Process the String**:\n   - Start from the beginning of the string and look for the substrings in the order they appear.\n   - For each match, perform the insertion and continue scanning the string from the position right after the inserted character.\n\n4. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - The string is \"BBBCDEBABCDDABCDD\".\n   - Scan the string from left to right:\n     - At index 2, we find \"BCDE\". According to rule 2, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes \"BBBCDEBBABCDDABCDD\".\n     - Continue scanning from index 7 (right after the inserted 'B').\n     - At index 9, we find \"ABCD\". According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"BBBCDEBBABCDAABCDD\".\n     - Continue scanning from index 14 (right after the inserted 'A').\n     - At index 14, we find \"ABCD\" again. According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"BBBCDEBBABCDAABCDAD\".\n     - Continue scanning from index 19 (right after the inserted 'A').\n     - No more substrings are found.\n\n5. **Final Result**: After processing the entire string, the final result is \"BBBCDEBBABCDAABCDAD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BBBCDEBBABCDAABCDAD>>>"
