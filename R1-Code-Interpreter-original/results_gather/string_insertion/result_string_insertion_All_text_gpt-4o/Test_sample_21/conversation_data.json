    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDDCDEAEDEABD\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to look for the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 1:**\n   - Look for \"ABCD\" in the string. The substring \"ABCD\" is found starting at index 0.\n   - According to Rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes \"ABCADDCDEAEDEABD\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2:**\n   - Look for \"BCDE\" in the string. The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 3.\n   - According to Rule 2, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\". The string becomes \"ABCADDCBDEAEDEABD\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 3:**\n   - Look for \"CDEA\" in the string. The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 6.\n   - According to Rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes \"ABCADDCBDEACAEDEABD\".\n\n5. **Apply Rule 4:**\n   - Look for \"DEAB\" in the string. The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 10.\n   - According to Rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\". The string becomes \"ABCADDCBDEACAEDEABDD\".\n\n6. **Apply Rule 5:**\n   - Look for \"EABC\" in the string. The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 12.\n   - According to Rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes \"ABCADDCBDEACAEDEABDD\".\n\n7. **Final String:**\n   - After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is \"ABCADDCBDEACAEDEABDD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<ABCADDCBDEACAEDEABDD>>>"
