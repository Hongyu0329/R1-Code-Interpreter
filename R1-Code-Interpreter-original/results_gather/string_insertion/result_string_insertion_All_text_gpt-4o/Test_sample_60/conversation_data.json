    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEDDEABBEABCAE\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to find occurrences of the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE)**: \n   - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 0 (BCDE**DDEABBEABCAE**).\n   - According to the rule, we insert 'B' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes \"BCDEB**DDEABBEABCAE**\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB)**:\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 5 (BCDEB**DDEAB**BEABCAE).\n   - According to the rule, we insert 'D' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes \"BCDEBDDEABD**BEABCAE**\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 5 (EABC)**:\n   - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 11 (BCDEBDDEABDB**EABC**AE).\n   - According to the rule, we insert 'E' after this substring.\n   - The string becomes \"BCDEBDDEABDBEABCE**AE**\".\n\n5. **Final String**: After applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is \"BCDEBDDEABDBEABCEAE\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<BCDEBDDEABDBEABCEAE>>>"
