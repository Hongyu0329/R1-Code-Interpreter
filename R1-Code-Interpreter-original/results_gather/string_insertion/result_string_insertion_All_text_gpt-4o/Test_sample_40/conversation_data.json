    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"CEABCCBCDEDCDEAAD\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation:**\n   - For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:**\n   - The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to process the string in a single pass and apply the insertions in the order they are found.\n\nLet's go through the string and apply the rules:\n\n- **Initial String:** CEABCCBCDEDCDEAAD\n\n- **Step 1:** Look for \"ABCD\":\n  - There is no \"ABCD\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 2:** Look for \"BCDE\":\n  - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 6 (0-based index).\n  - According to the rule, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n  - The string becomes: CEABCCBCDEBDCDEAAD\n\n- **Step 3:** Look for \"CDEA\":\n  - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 10 (0-based index) in the updated string.\n  - According to the rule, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n  - The string becomes: CEABCCBCDEBDCDEACAD\n\n- **Step 4:** Look for \"DEAB\":\n  - There is no \"DEAB\" in the string.\n\n- **Step 5:** Look for \"EABC\":\n  - There is no \"EABC\" in the string.\n\nAfter applying the T operation, the final string is \"CEABCCBCDEBDCDEACAD\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<CEABCCBCDEBDCDEACAD>>>"
