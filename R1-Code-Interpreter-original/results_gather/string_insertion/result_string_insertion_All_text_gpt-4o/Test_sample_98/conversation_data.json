    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply the T Operation:**\n   - For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring.\n\n3. **Process the String:**\n   - Start from the leftmost part of the string and move to the right, applying the T operation as we find each substring.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Initial String:** EAABCDADEABECDEAAA\n   - **Find \"ABCD\":** The substring \"ABCD\" starts at index 2 (0-based index). According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\".\n     - Resulting string: EAABCD**A**ADEABECDEAAA\n   - **Find \"DEAB\":** The substring \"DEAB\" starts at index 8. According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n     - Resulting string: EAABCDADEAB**D**ECDEAAA\n   - **Find \"CDEA\":** The substring \"CDEA\" starts at index 11. According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n     - Resulting string: EAABCDADEABDECDEA**C**AAA\n\n5. **Final String:**\n   - After processing all applicable substrings from left to right, the final string is \"EAABCDADEABDECDEACAAA\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<EAABCDADEABDECDEACAAA>>>"
