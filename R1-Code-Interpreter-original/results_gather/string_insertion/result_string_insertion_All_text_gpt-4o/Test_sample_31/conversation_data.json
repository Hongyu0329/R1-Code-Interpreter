    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DEABEDEABDCDEAEE\" by following the defined rules. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings:**\n   - We need to find occurrences of the substrings \"ABCD\", \"BCDE\", \"CDEA\", \"DEAB\", and \"EABC\" in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Rule 4 (DEAB):**\n   - The substring \"DEAB\" appears at index 0-3 and index 6-9.\n   - According to Rule 4, we insert 'D' after each occurrence of \"DEAB\".\n\n3. **Apply Rule 3 (CDEA):**\n   - The substring \"CDEA\" appears at index 10-13.\n   - According to Rule 3, we insert 'C' after the occurrence of \"CDEA\".\n\n4. **Apply Rule 5 (EABC):**\n   - The substring \"EABC\" does not appear in the string.\n\n5. **Apply Rule 1 (ABCD):**\n   - The substring \"ABCD\" does not appear in the string.\n\n6. **Apply Rule 2 (BCDE):**\n   - The substring \"BCDE\" does not appear in the string.\n\n7. **Perform Insertions:**\n   - Insert 'D' after the first \"DEAB\" (index 3), resulting in \"DEABD\".\n   - Insert 'D' after the second \"DEAB\" (index 9), resulting in \"DEABEDEABD\".\n   - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\" (index 13), resulting in \"DEABEDEABDCDEAC\".\n\n8. **Construct the Final String:**\n   - After performing all insertions from left to right, the final string is \"DEABDEDEABDCDEACEE\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DEABDEDEABDCDEACEE>>>"
