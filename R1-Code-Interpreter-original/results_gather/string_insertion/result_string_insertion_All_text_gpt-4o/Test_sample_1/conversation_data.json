    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"DBCDEBBCDECABCDC\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the indices of the string will change. We need to keep track of these changes to ensure that subsequent insertions are made at the correct positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"DBCDEBBCDECABCDC\":\n\n- **Initial String**: DBCDEBBCDECABCDC\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the substrings and their positions:\n  - BCDE at index 1 (substring \"BCDE\" starts at index 1)\n  - BCDE at index 7 (substring \"BCDE\" starts at index 7)\n  - CDEA at index 8 (substring \"CDEA\" starts at index 8)\n  - ABCD at index 10 (substring \"ABCD\" starts at index 10)\n\n- **Step 2**: Apply the insertions from left to right:\n  - Insert 'B' after the first \"BCDE\" (at index 1): DBCDEB**B**BBCDECABCDC\n  - Insert 'B' after the second \"BCDE\" (at index 7, adjusted to index 8 after the first insertion): DBCDEBBBCDEB**B**CDECABCDC\n  - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\" (at index 8, adjusted to index 10 after the previous insertions): DBCDEBBBCDEBCDE**C**ABCDC\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\" (at index 10, adjusted to index 14 after the previous insertions): DBCDEBBBCDEBCDEABCD**A**C\n\n- **Final String**: After all insertions, the final string is \"DBCDEBBBCDEBCDEABCDAC\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<DBCDEBBBCDEBCDEABCDAC>>>"
