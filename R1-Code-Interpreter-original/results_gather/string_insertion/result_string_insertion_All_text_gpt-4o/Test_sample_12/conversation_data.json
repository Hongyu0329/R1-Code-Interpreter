    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDECABCDCABCD\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions are to be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the string: \"BCDECABCDCABCD\".\n   - Look for the substring \"BCDE\":\n     - Found at index 0-3 (\"BCDE\"), insert 'B' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBCABCDCABCD\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the inserted character:\n     - Look for the substring \"CDEA\":\n       - Found at index 2-5 (\"CDEA\"), insert 'C' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBCCABCDCABCD\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the inserted character:\n     - Look for the substring \"DEAB\":\n       - Found at index 4-7 (\"DEAB\"), insert 'D' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDCABCDCABCD\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the inserted character:\n     - Look for the substring \"EABC\":\n       - Found at index 6-9 (\"EABC\"), insert 'E' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDCABCECDCABCD\".\n   - Continue from the next position after the inserted character:\n     - Look for the substring \"ABCD\":\n       - Found at index 8-11 (\"ABCD\"), insert 'A' after it. The string becomes \"BCDEBCCDCABCECDACABCD\".\n\n4. **Final String**: After applying all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is \"BCDEBCCDCABCECDACABCD\".\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<BCDEBCCDCABCECDACABCD>>>"
