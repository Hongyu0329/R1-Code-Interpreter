    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EBCDEEEABCCBCDE\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the corresponding character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"EBCDEEEABCCBCDE\":\n\n- **Initial String**: EBCDEEEABCCBCDE\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"BCDE\":\n  - Found at index 1 (0-based index).\n  - According to rule 2, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n  - New string: EBCDEBEEABCCBCDE\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify the next occurrence of the substring \"BCDE\":\n  - Found at index 11 (0-based index, considering the previous insertion).\n  - According to rule 2, insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n  - New string: EBCDEBEEABCCBCDEB\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify the occurrence of the substring \"EABC\":\n  - Found at index 6 (0-based index, considering previous insertions).\n  - According to rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\".\n  - New string: EBCDEBEEABCECCBCDEB\n\n- **Step 4**: Identify the occurrence of the substring \"CDEA\":\n  - Found at index 3 (0-based index, considering previous insertions).\n  - According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n  - New string: EBCDEACBEEABCECCBCDEB\n\n- **Step 5**: Identify the occurrence of the substring \"DEAB\":\n  - Found at index 4 (0-based index, considering previous insertions).\n  - According to rule 4, insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n  - New string: EBCDEACBEEABDECCBCDEB\n\nAfter applying all applicable rules from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<EBCDEACBEEABDECCBCDEB>>>"
