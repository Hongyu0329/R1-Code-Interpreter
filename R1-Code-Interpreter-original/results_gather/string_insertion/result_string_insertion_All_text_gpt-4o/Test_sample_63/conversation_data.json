    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"EABCBDEABACDEA\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, as specified.\n\n3. **Track Insertions**: As we perform insertions, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to carefully track these changes to ensure correct insertions.\n\nLet's analyze the given string \"EABCBDEABACDEA\":\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the substrings:\n  - The substring \"EABC\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 5, we insert 'E' after \"EABC\".\n  - The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 3. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after \"BCDE\".\n  - The substring \"CDEA\" is found starting at index 5. According to rule 3, we insert 'C' after \"CDEA\".\n  - The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 7. According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after \"DEAB\".\n\n- **Step 2**: Perform the insertions from left to right:\n  - After \"EABC\" (at index 4), insert 'E'. The string becomes \"EABCEBCBDEABACDEA\".\n  - After \"BCDE\" (at index 8, considering the previous insertion), insert 'B'. The string becomes \"EABCEBCBDEBABACDEA\".\n  - After \"CDEA\" (at index 13, considering previous insertions), insert 'C'. The string becomes \"EABCEBCBDEBABACDEAC\".\n  - After \"DEAB\" (at index 17, considering previous insertions), insert 'D'. The string becomes \"EABCEBCBDEBABACDEACD\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Finalize the string:\n  - The final string after all insertions is \"EABCEBCBDEBABACDEACD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is:\n\n<<<EABCEBCBDEBABACDEACD>>>"
