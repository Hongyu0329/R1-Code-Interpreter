    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ADABCDCCDEADABCD\" and determine the resulting string after one operation. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, we will insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the positions of subsequent substrings may change. We need to adjust our search for substrings accordingly.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string \"ADABCDCCDEADABCD\":\n\n- **Initial String**: ADABCDCCDEADABCD\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of \"ABCD\":\n  - Found at index 2 (substring \"ABCD\" from index 2 to 5).\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\": Resulting string becomes \"ADABCDACCCDEADABCD\".\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify the next occurrence of \"ABCD\":\n  - Found at index 13 (substring \"ABCD\" from index 13 to 16).\n  - Insert 'A' after \"ABCD\": Resulting string becomes \"ADABCDACCCDEADABCDA\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify the occurrence of \"CDEA\":\n  - Found at index 8 (substring \"CDEA\" from index 8 to 11).\n  - Insert 'C' after \"CDEA\": Resulting string becomes \"ADABCDACCCDEACDABCD\".\n\n- **Step 4**: Identify the occurrence of \"DEAB\":\n  - Found at index 10 (substring \"DEAB\" from index 10 to 13).\n  - Insert 'D' after \"DEAB\": Resulting string becomes \"ADABCDACCCDEACDABCD\".\n\n- **Step 5**: Identify the occurrence of \"BCDE\":\n  - Found at index 3 (substring \"BCDE\" from index 3 to 6).\n  - Insert 'B' after \"BCDE\": Resulting string becomes \"ADABCDACCCDEACDABCD\".\n\n- **Step 6**: Identify the occurrence of \"EABC\":\n  - Found at index 11 (substring \"EABC\" from index 11 to 14).\n  - Insert 'E' after \"EABC\": Resulting string becomes \"ADABCDACCCDEACDABCD\".\n\nAfter applying all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is:\n\n<<<ADABCDACCCDEACDABCD>>>"
