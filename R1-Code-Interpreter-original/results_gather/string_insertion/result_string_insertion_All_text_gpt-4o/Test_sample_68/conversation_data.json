    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"BCDEBDEABBDEAB\" and follow the rules for inserting characters based on the specified substrings. Let's analyze the string step by step:\n\n1. **Initial String**: BCDEBDEABBDEAB\n\n2. **Identify Substrings and Insert Characters**:\n   - **BCDE**: The substring \"BCDE\" is found starting at index 0. According to rule 2, we insert 'B' after this substring. The string becomes \"BCDEB\" + \"BDEABBDEAB\".\n   - **BDEAB**: The substring \"BDEAB\" is found starting at index 5 (after the first insertion). According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after this substring. The string becomes \"BCDEBBDEABD\" + \"DEAB\".\n   - **DEAB**: The substring \"DEAB\" is found starting at index 10 (after the second insertion). According to rule 4, we insert 'D' after this substring. The string becomes \"BCDEBBDEABDDEAB\" + \"D\".\n\n3. **Final String After One Operation T**: After processing all applicable substrings from left to right, the final string is \"BCDEBBDEABDDEABD\".\n\nTherefore, the string after one operation T is <<<BCDEBBDEABDDEABD>>>."
