    "To solve the problem, we need to apply the T operation to the given string \"ABCDCCDEADCDEAEB\" and determine the resulting string. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Substrings**: We need to identify all occurrences of the specified substrings (ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, EABC) in the given string.\n\n2. **Apply Insertions**: For each identified substring, insert the specified character immediately after the substring. The insertions should be done from left to right, which means we need to keep track of the changes in the string as we progress.\n\n3. **Track Changes**: As we insert characters, the positions of subsequent substrings may shift. Therefore, we need to carefully track these changes to ensure that all insertions are made correctly.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given string:\n\n- **Initial String**: ABCDCCDEADCDEAEB\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the first occurrence of the substring \"ABCD\" at index 0. According to rule 1, insert 'A' after \"ABCD\". The string becomes: ABCDA**CDCCDEADCDEAEB**.\n\n- **Step 2**: Next, identify the substring \"CDEA\" at index 8 (considering the shift due to the previous insertion). According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes: ABCDACDCCDEAC**DEAEB**.\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify the substring \"CDEA\" again at index 12 (considering the shift due to the previous insertions). According to rule 3, insert 'C' after \"CDEA\". The string becomes: ABCDACDCCDEACDEAC**EB**.\n\n- **Step 4**: Identify the substring \"EABC\" at index 15 (considering the shift due to the previous insertions). According to rule 5, insert 'E' after \"EABC\". The string becomes: ABCDACDCCDEACDEACE**B**.\n\nAfter applying all possible insertions from left to right, the final string is \"ABCDACDCCDEACDEACEB\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<ABCDACDCCDEACDEACEB>>>"
