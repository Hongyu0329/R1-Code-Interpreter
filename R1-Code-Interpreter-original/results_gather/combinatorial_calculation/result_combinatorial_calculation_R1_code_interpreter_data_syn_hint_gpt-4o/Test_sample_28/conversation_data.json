  "question": "Given 5 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 78. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 9, 1, 7, 9, 7, the target values is: 78\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 1, 7, 9, and 7 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 1, 7, 9, 7.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, we can use a brute-force approach to test different possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the correct combination.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 1, 7, 9, 7]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result shows that multiple expressions were found that evaluate to 78 using the given numbers and operations. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. `(9-1+7)+(9*7)`\n2. `(9-1)+(7*9)+7`\n3. `9-(1-7)+(9*7)`\n4. `9-(1-(7*9))+7`\n\nThese expressions are valid solutions to the problem, as they use each number exactly once in the given order and evaluate to the target value of 78.\n\nNow, let's choose one of these expressions to present as the final answer. I'll select the first expression for simplicity.\n\nThe expression `(9-1+7)+(9*7)` can be represented in the required format as:\n\n<<<[9, -, 1, +, 7, +, (, 9, *, 7, )]>>>"
