    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 7, 9, 1, and 6 in that order, result in the value 69. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 7, 7, 9, 1, 6.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can insert operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 69.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Let's start by considering the possible operations between the numbers and see if we can reach the target value.\n\nWe can use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of operations and parentheses. However, since the number of possibilities is not too large, we can manually reason through some potential solutions.\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n\n- Start with the first two numbers: 7 and 7. We can try multiplying them: 7 * 7 = 49.\n- Next, we have 49 and 9. We can try adding them: 49 + 9 = 58.\n- Now, we have 58 and 1. We can try adding them: 58 + 1 = 59.\n- Finally, we have 59 and 6. We can try adding them: 59 + 6 = 65.\n\nThis approach doesn't reach the target value of 69. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with the first two numbers: 7 and 7. We can try multiplying them: 7 * 7 = 49.\n- Next, we have 49 and 9. We can try adding them: 49 + 9 = 58.\n- Now, we have 58 and 1. We can try multiplying them: 58 * 1 = 58.\n- Finally, we have 58 and 6. We can try adding them: 58 + 6 = 64.\n\nThis approach also doesn't reach the target value of 69. Let's try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n- Start with the first three numbers: 7, 7, and 9. We can try multiplying the first two and adding the third: (7 * 7) + 9 = 49 + 9 = 58.\n- Now, we have 58 and 1. We can try adding them: 58 + 1 = 59.\n- Finally, we have 59 and 6. We can try multiplying them: 59 * 6 = 354.\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with the first two numbers: 7 and 7. We can try adding them: 7 + 7 = 14.\n- Next, we have 14 and 9. We can try multiplying them: 14 * 9 = 126.\n- Now, we have 126 and 1. We can try subtracting them: 126 - 1 = 125.\n- Finally, we have 125 and 6. We can try dividing them: 125 / 6 = 20.8333.\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with the first two numbers: 7 and 7. We can try adding them: 7 + 7 = 14.\n- Next, we have 14 and 9. We can try multiplying them: 14 * 9 = 126.\n- Now, we have 126 and 1. We can try dividing them: 126 / 1 = 126.\n- Finally, we have 126 and 6. We can try subtracting them: 126 - 6 = 120.\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with the first two numbers: 7 and 7.
