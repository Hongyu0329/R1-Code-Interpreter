  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 5, 5, 3, 6, the target values is: 24\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 5, 3, and 6 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- Start with the expression: 5 _ 5 _ 3 _ 6\n- Try different operations and use parentheses to achieve the target value of 24.\n\nLet's generate a Python script to test different combinations of operations and parentheses:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [5, 5, 3, 6]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n    # Generate expressions with different parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will test different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result provided two expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 5, 5, 3, and 6 in the given order. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. `(5 + 5) * 3 - 6`: This expression evaluates to 24.\n2. `(5 / 5 + 3) * 6`: This expression also evaluates to 24.\n\nBoth expressions are valid solutions to the problem. However, since the task requires returning the answer in a specific format, let's choose one of these expressions and format it accordingly.\n\nLet's choose the first expression `(5 + 5) * 3 - 6` and format it as a list of values and symbols:\n\n- The expression can be represented as: `5, +, 5, ), *, 3, -, 6`\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer is:\n\n<<<[5, +, 5, ), *, 3, -, 6]>>>"
