  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 3, 8, 7, and 7 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n- We can also try using division, but we need to be careful with integer division and ensure it doesn't lead to non-integer results unless necessary.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these strategies:\n\n1. Start with multiplication and addition.\n2. Use parentheses to adjust the order of operations if needed.\n\nLet's test a few combinations:\n\n- (3 * 8) - (7 / 7) = 24\n- (3 * 7) + (7 - 8) = 24\n\nLet's check if any of these combinations work:\n\n```python\n# Testing different combinations to reach the target value of 24\ndef test_combinations():\n    # Combination 1: (3 * 8) - (7 / 7)\n    result1 = (3 * 8) - (7 / 7)\n    \n    # Combination 2: (3 * 7) + (7 - 8)\n    result2 = (3 * 7) + (7 - 8)\n    \n    return result1, result2\n\n# Print the results of the combinations\nprint(test_combinations())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if any of these combinations result in 24.",
    "The previous attempt did not yield the correct result of 24. Let's try a more systematic approach to explore different combinations of operations and parentheses.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider all possible ways to insert operations and parentheses between the numbers 3, 8, 7, and 7. We can use a brute-force approach to try all combinations of operations and parentheses.\n\nLet's generate a more comprehensive code that systematically tries different combinations of operations and parentheses:\n\n1. Use a list of operations: `['+', '-', '*', '/']`.\n2. Use nested loops to try all combinations of these operations between the numbers.\n3. Use parentheses to change the order of operations and evaluate the expressions.\n\nHere's the code to explore these possibilities:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [3, 8, 7, 7]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define the operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\ndef find_expression(numbers, target):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n        # Generate expressions with different parenthesis placements\n        expressions = [\n            f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]})\",\n            f\"(({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\",\n            f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\",\n            f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} (({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]})\",\n            f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}))\"\n        ]\n        \n        for expr in expressions:\n            if safe_eval(expr) == target:\n                return expr\n\n# Find and print the expression that evaluates to the target\nresult = find_expression(numbers, target)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will systematically try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute this code to find the correct expression.",
    "The code execution result shows that the expression `(3 * 8) + (7 - 7)` evaluates to 24, which is correct. However, the task requires the answer to be formatted as a list of values and symbols.\n\nLet's convert the expression into the required format:\n\nThe expression `(3 * 8) + (7 - 7)` can be broken down into the following list:\n\n- Start with `3`\n- Multiply by `8`\n- Add `7`\n- Subtract `7`\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\n<<<[3, *, 8, +, (, 7, -, 7, )]>>>"
