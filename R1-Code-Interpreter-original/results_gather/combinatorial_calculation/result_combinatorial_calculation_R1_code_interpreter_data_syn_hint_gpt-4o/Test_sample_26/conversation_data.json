    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 8, 8, 1, and 5 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 8, 8, 1, 5.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, it might be helpful to use a systematic approach or a brute-force method to explore all possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 8, 8, 1, 5]\n# Target value\ntarget = 78\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate expressions with different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result shows that we found some expressions that evaluate to the target value of 78. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. `(9+(8*8))+(1*5)` evaluates to 78.\n2. `9+((8*8)*1)+5` evaluates to 78.\n3. `9+((8*8)/1)+5` evaluates to 78.\n\nThese expressions are valid solutions to the problem, as they use each number exactly once in the given order and achieve the target value of 78.\n\nNow, let's format one of these solutions according to the required format. I'll choose the first expression for clarity.\n\nThe expression `(9+(8*8))+(1*5)` can be represented in the required format as:\n\n<<<[9, +, (, 8, *, 8, ), +, (, 1, *, 5, )]>>>"
