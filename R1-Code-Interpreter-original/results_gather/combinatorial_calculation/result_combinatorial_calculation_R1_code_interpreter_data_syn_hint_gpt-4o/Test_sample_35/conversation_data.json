  "question": "Given 5 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 69. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 8, 5, 3, 2, 5, the target values is: 69\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 8, 5, 3, 2, and 5 in that order, result in the value 69. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 8, 5, 3, 2, 5.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can insert any of the arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses to form an expression that equals 69.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, it is efficient to use a programmatic approach to explore the possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find the correct expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [8, 5, 3, 2, 5]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 69:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 69. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
