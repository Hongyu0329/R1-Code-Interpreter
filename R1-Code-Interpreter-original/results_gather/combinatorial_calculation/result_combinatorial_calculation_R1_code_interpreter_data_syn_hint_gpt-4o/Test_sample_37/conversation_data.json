Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 69. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 5, 2, 8, and 9 in that order, result in the value 69. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible operations and how they might be combined. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and in the given order. \n\n1. Start with the first number: 5\n2. Consider possible operations with the next number: 5\n3. Continue with the next number: 2\n4. Then with the next number: 8\n5. Finally, with the last number: 9\n\nWe can try different combinations of operations and use parentheses to adjust the order of operations. Let's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n- We can also use parentheses to prioritize certain operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these ideas:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [5, 5, 2, 8, 9]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(numbers, ops):\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        expr += f\"{ops[i-1]}{numbers[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Try different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\"\n    ]\n    for expr in expressions:\n        try:\n            if eval(expr) == 69:\n                print(expr)\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\n            continue\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination of operations and parentheses."
