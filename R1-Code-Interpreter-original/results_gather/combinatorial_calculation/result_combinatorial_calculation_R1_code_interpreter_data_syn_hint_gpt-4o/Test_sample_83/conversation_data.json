    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 6, 7, 8, and 3 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers quickly.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these operations:\n\n- We can start by multiplying some numbers and then adding or subtracting the others.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (6 * 3) + (7 - 8)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- (6 * 3) = 18\n- 7 - 8 = -1\n- 18 + (-1) = 17\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (6 * 3) + 7 + 8\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- (6 * 3) = 18\n- 18 + 7 = 25\n- 25 + 8 = 33\n\nThis also doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 6 * (7 - (8 - 3))\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 8 - 3 = 5\n- 7 - 5 = 2\n- 6 * 2 = 12\n\nThis doesn't give us 24 either. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (6 + 7) * (8 - 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 6 + 7 = 13\n- 8 - 3 = 5\n- 13 * 5 = 65\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 6 * 7 - (8 + 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 6 * 7 = 42\n- 8 + 3 = 11\n- 42 - 11 = 31\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (6 + 7 + 8) * 3\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 6 + 7 + 8 = 21\n- 21 * 3 = 63\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 6 * (7 - 8 + 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 7 - 8 = -1\n- -1 + 3 = 2\n- 6 * 2 = 12\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (6 * 7) - (8 + 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 6 * 7 = 42\n- 8 + 3 = 11\n- 42 - 11 = 31\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (6 * 7) - 8 - 3\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 6 * 7 = 42\n- 42 - 8 = 34\n- 34 - 3 = 31\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 6 * (7 - 8) + 3\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 7 - 8 = -1\n- 6 * -1 = -6\n- -6 + 3 = -3\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 6 * 7 - 8 + 3\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 6 * 7 = 42\n- 42 - 8 = 34\n- 34 + 3 = 37\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 6 * (7 - 8) + 3\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 7 - 8 = -1\n- 6 * -1 = -6\n- -6 + 3 = -3\n\nThis doesn't give us 24.
