    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 4, and 2 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations:\n\n1. Addition: 4 + 4 + 2 = 10\n2. Subtraction: 4 - 4 + 2 = 2, 4 - (4 + 2) = -2, etc.\n3. Multiplication: 4 * 4 * 2 = 32, etc.\n4. Division: 4 / 4 + 2 = 3, etc.\n\nWe need to find a combination that results in exactly 10. Let's try to find such a combination by considering the use of parentheses and different operations.\n\nOne possible solution is:\n- Use addition and multiplication: (4 + 4) * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16, which is not correct.\n- Use subtraction and addition: 4 + 4 * 2 = 4 + 8 = 12, which is not correct.\n- Use division and addition: 4 / 4 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try another approach by using parentheses effectively:\n\n- (4 + 4) * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16, which is not correct.\n- 4 + (4 * 2) = 4 + 8 = 12, which is not correct.\n- (4 * 2) + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try using subtraction and parentheses:\n\n- 4 * (4 - 2) = 4 * 2 = 8, which is not correct.\n- (4 * 4) - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14, which is not correct.\n- 4 + (4 - 2) = 4 + 2 = 6, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try using division and parentheses:\n\n- (4 / 4) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3, which is not correct.\n- 4 / (4 / 2) = 4 / 2 = 2, which is not correct.\n- (4 + 4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4, which is not correct.\n\nIt seems that none of these combinations are working. Let's try a different approach by using a systematic search with code to find the correct combination.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [4, 4, 2]\ntarget = 10\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    expr1 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    expr2 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    expr3 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    \n    for expr in [expr1, expr2, expr3]:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the expression `(4 + 4) + 2` evaluates to 10, which is indeed the correct solution. However, the task requires us to return the answer in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols.\n\nThe expression `(4 + 4) + 2` can be represented in the required format as `[4, +, 4, +, 2]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[4, +, 4, +, 2]>>>"
