    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 6, 4, and 6 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps achieve the target value.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher values like 24.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (9 - 6) * (4 + 6)\n\nThis combination uses subtraction and addition within parentheses, and multiplication between the results of the parentheses.\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (9 - 6) = 3\n- (4 + 6) = 10\n- 3 * 10 = 30\n\nThis result is not 24, so we need to try another combination.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 9 * (6 / (4 - 6))\n\nThis combination uses multiplication and division, with parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (4 - 6) = -2\n- 6 / -2 = -3\n- 9 * -3 = -27\n\nThis result is not 24 either.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- (9 * 6) / (4 - 6)\n\nThis combination uses multiplication and division, with parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (4 - 6) = -2\n- 9 * 6 = 54\n- 54 / -2 = -27\n\nThis result is not 24 either.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- (9 * 6) / (6 - 4)\n\nThis combination uses multiplication and division, with parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (6 - 4) = 2\n- 9 * 6 = 54\n- 54 / 2 = 27\n\nThis result is not 24 either.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- (9 * 4) - (6 + 6)\n\nThis combination uses multiplication and subtraction, with parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- 9 * 4 = 36\n- (6 + 6) = 12\n- 36 - 12 = 24\n\nThis result is 24, which is the target value.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of operations and parentheses is:\n\n<<<[9, *, 4, -, (, 6, +, 6, )]>>>"
