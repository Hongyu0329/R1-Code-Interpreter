    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the sequence of numbers [6, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], results in the value 100. The challenge is to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 6, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6.\n2. We can use the operations: +, -, *, /, and parentheses.\n3. The goal is to form an expression that evaluates to 100.\n\nTo approach this, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since the problem is complex and involves multiple operations, a brute-force approach using code to test different combinations is suitable.\n\nLet's write a Python script to test various combinations of operations and parentheses to find a valid expression that evaluates to 100.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# The numbers in the given order\nnumbers = [6, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Try different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}(({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 100:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 100. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result shows several expressions that evaluate to 100 using the given numbers and operations. Let's analyze these expressions to ensure they meet the problem's requirements:\n\n1. **(6+4)-(5-(4*5))*6**: This expression evaluates to 100.\n2. **(6+4)*((5+4)-5+6)**: This expression evaluates to 100.\n3. **(6+4)*((5*4)/5+6)**: This expression evaluates to 100.\n4. **(6-4)*((5*4)+5*6)**: This expression evaluates to 100.\n5. **(6*4)*(5+(4*5))/6**: This expression evaluates to 100.\n\nEach of these expressions uses the numbers [6, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6] in the given order and applies arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 100.\n\nLet's choose one of these valid expressions to present as the final answer. I'll select the first expression for simplicity:\n\n<<<[6, +, 4, -, (, 5, -, (, 4, *, 5, ), ), *, 6]>>>"
