    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 6, 7, 2, and 8 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 6, 7, 2, 8.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach with code can help us explore the possibilities efficiently.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find the correct expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# The numbers in the given order\nnumbers = [1, 6, 7, 2, 8]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the expression `(1*6)+(7+2)*8` evaluates to 78, which is the target value. This expression uses the numbers 1, 6, 7, 2, and 8 in the given order and applies the operations and parentheses correctly to achieve the desired result.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n- First, calculate `1*6`, which equals 6.\n- Then, calculate `7+2`, which equals 9.\n- Multiply the result of `7+2` by 8, which equals 72.\n- Finally, add the result of `1*6` (which is 6) to 72, resulting in 78.\n\nThis expression satisfies all the conditions of the problem: it uses each number exactly once, in the given order, and achieves the target value of 78.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[1, *, 6, +, (, 7, +, 2, ), *, 8]>>>"
