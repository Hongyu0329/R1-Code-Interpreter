  "question": "Given 5 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 78. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, the target values is: 78\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the numbers 9, 9, 1, 1, and 1 to achieve the target value of 78. The order of the numbers cannot be changed, so we must work with them as they are given.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and how they can be combined to reach the target:\n\n1. We have two 9s, which can be multiplied to get a larger number.\n2. We have three 1s, which can be used to adjust the result through addition or subtraction.\n3. Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n- Start by multiplying the two 9s: \\(9 \\times 9 = 81\\).\n- We need to adjust 81 to become 78. This can be done by subtracting 3.\n- We have three 1s, which can be used to subtract 3 by using subtraction and addition.\n\nLet's construct the expression:\n\n- \\(9 \\times 9 = 81\\)\n- Subtract 1: \\(81 - 1 = 80\\)\n- Subtract another 1: \\(80 - 1 = 79\\)\n- Subtract the last 1: \\(79 - 1 = 78\\)\n\nThus, the expression is: \\(9 \\times 9 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 78\\).\n\nNow, let's represent this solution in the required format:\n\n<<<[9, *, 9, -, 1, -, 1, -, 1]>>>"
