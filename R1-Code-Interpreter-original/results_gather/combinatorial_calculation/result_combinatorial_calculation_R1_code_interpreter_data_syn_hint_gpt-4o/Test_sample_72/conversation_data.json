    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 4, 7, and 8 in the given order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by reasoning through possible combinations:\n\n- Start with the first two numbers: 4 and 4. We can try adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing them.\n- Then, take the result and combine it with the next number, 7, using an operation.\n- Finally, take the result and combine it with the last number, 8, using an operation.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that results in 24:\n\n- One possible approach is to try multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (4 * 4) + (7 - 8)\n\nThis combination doesn't work, so let's try another one:\n\n- (4 + 4) * (7 - 8)\n\nThis also doesn't work, so let's try another one:\n\n- 4 * (4 + 7) - 8\n\nThis combination results in 24:\n\n- 4 * (4 + 7) = 4 * 11 = 44\n- 44 - 8 = 36\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- 4 * 4 + 7 - 8\n\nThis combination results in 24:\n\n- 4 * 4 = 16\n- 16 + 7 = 23\n- 23 - 8 = 15\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- 4 * (4 + 7) - 8\n\nThis combination results in 24:\n\n- 4 * (4 + 7) = 4 * 11 = 44\n- 44 - 8 = 36\n\nThis doesn't work either.
