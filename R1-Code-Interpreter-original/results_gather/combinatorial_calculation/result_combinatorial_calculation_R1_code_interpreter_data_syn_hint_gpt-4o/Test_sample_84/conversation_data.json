Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 3, 1, 3, and 4 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (3 + 1) * (3 + 4)\n\nThis combination uses all the numbers in the given order and applies operations that could potentially result in 24.\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (3 + 1) = 4\n- (3 + 4) = 7\n- 4 * 7 = 28\n\nThis result is not 24, so we need to try another combination.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 3 * (1 + 3) * 4\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (1 + 3) = 4\n- 3 * 4 = 12\n- 12 * 4 = 48\n\nThis result is also not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (3 * 1) + (3 * 4)\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (3 * 1) = 3\n- (3 * 4) = 12\n- 3 + 12 = 15\n\nThis result is not 24 either. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 3 * 1 * 3 * 4\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- 3 * 1 = 3\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 9 * 4 = 36\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (3 + 1) * 3 + 4\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (3 + 1) = 4\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n- 12 + 4 = 16\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 3 * (1 + 3) + 4\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (1 + 3) = 4\n- 3 * 4 = 12\n- 12 + 4 = 16\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 3 + 1 + 3 * 4\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- 3 + 1 = 4\n- 3 * 4 = 12\n- 4 + 12 = 16\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 3 * (1 + 3 + 4)\n\nNow, let's calculate this expression:\n\n- (1 + 3 + 4) = 8\n- 3 * 8 = 24\n\nThis result is 24, which is the target value.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of operations and parentheses is:\n\n- 3 * (1 + 3 + 4)\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\n<<<[3, *, (, 1, +, 3, +, 4, )]>>>"
