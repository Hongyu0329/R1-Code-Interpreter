    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 2, 8, and 9 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps achieve the target value.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try using multiplication and addition, as they can quickly increase the value to reach 24.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Use multiplication between the first two numbers, then add the third number, and finally add the fourth number.\n\nThis can be represented as: (9 * 2) + 8 - 9\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (9 * 2) = 18\n- 18 + 8 = 26\n- 26 - 9 = 17\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Use multiplication between the first two numbers, then add the third number, and finally subtract the fourth number.\n\nThis can be represented as: (9 * 2) + (8 - 9)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (9 * 2) = 18\n- 8 - 9 = -1\n- 18 + (-1) = 17\n\nThis also doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Use multiplication between the first two numbers, then subtract the third number, and finally add the fourth number.\n\nThis can be represented as: (9 * 2) - 8 + 9\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (9 * 2) = 18\n- 18 - 8 = 10\n- 10 + 9 = 19\n\nThis also doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Use multiplication between the first two numbers, then add the third number, and finally multiply by the fourth number.\n\nThis can be represented as: (9 * 2) + (8 * 9)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (9 * 2) = 18\n- 8 * 9 = 72\n- 18 + 72 = 90\n\nThis also doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Use multiplication between the first two numbers, then multiply the result by the third number, and finally divide by the fourth number.\n\nThis can be represented as: (9 * 2 * 8) / 9\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- 9 * 2 = 18\n- 18 * 8 = 144\n- 144 / 9 = 16\n\nThis also doesn't give us 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Use multiplication between the first two numbers, then divide by the third number, and finally add the fourth number.\n\nThis can be represented as: (9 * 2) / 8 + 9\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- 9 * 2 = 18\n- 18 / 8 = 2.25\n- 2.25 + 9 = 11.25\n\nThis also doesn't give us 24.
