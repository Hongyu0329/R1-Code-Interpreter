    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the sequence of numbers [7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5], results in the value 100. The challenge is to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5.\n2. We need to insert operations (+, -, *, /) and possibly parentheses to achieve the target value of 100.\n3. The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n\nTo approach this, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach with some optimization might be necessary. We can use Python to automate the trial of different combinations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# The numbers in the given order\nnumbers = [7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate the expression without parentheses\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr) == 100:\n        print(f\"Solution without parentheses: {expr}\")\n    \n    # Try adding parentheses in different places\n    for i in range(1, 6):\n        for j in range(i+1, 7):\n            expr_with_parens = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n            if evaluate_expression(expr_with_parens) == 100:\n                print(f\"Solution with parentheses: {expr_with_parens}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a valid expression that evaluates to 100. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution."
