    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 8, 3, and 5 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try using multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (1 + 8) * (3 + 5)\n\nThis combination uses parentheses to group the numbers and operations in a way that might reach 24.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (1 + 8) = 9\n- (3 + 5) = 8\n- 9 * 8 = 72\n\nThis result is too high. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 1 * (8 + 3) + 5\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (8 + 3) = 11\n- 1 * 11 = 11\n- 11 + 5 = 16\n\nThis result is too low. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (1 + 8) * 3 - 5\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (1 + 8) = 9\n- 9 * 3 = 27\n- 27 - 5 = 22\n\nThis result is still not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 1 + (8 * 3) - 5\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (8 * 3) = 24\n- 1 + 24 = 25\n- 25 - 5 = 20\n\nThis result is still not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 1 * 8 + 3 * 5\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- 1 * 8 = 8\n- 3 * 5 = 15\n- 8 + 15 = 23\n\nThis result is still not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (1 + 8) * 3 + 5\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (1 + 8) = 9\n- 9 * 3 = 27\n- 27 + 5 = 32\n\nThis result is still not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 1 + 8 * (3 + 5)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (3 + 5) = 8\n- 8 * 8 = 64\n- 1 + 64 = 65\n\nThis result is still not 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 1 + 8 + 3 * 5\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- 1 + 8 = 9\n- 3 * 5 = 15\n- 9 + 15 = 24\n\nThis combination works! The result is 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is:\n\n<<<[1, +, 8, +, 3, *, 5]>>>"
