    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the sequence of numbers [9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 9], results in the value 100. The challenge is to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 9.\n2. We need to insert operations (+, -, *, /) and possibly parentheses to achieve the target value of 100.\n3. The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n\nTo approach this, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. However, given the complexity, it might be more efficient to use a programmatic approach to explore possible combinations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# The numbers in the given order\nnumbers = [9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 9]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 100:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 100. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code execution result provided three expressions that evaluate to 100 using the given numbers and operations. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. `((9-5)+6)+(4+6)*9`\n2. `(9-(5-6))+(4+6)*9`\n3. `(9*(5+6))+(4+6)-9`\n\nEach of these expressions uses the numbers in the given order and applies arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 100.\n\nNow, let's format one of these expressions into the required list format. I'll choose the first expression for this purpose:\n\nExpression: `((9-5)+6)+(4+6)*9`\n\nThis can be represented in the list format as:\n- Start with the first number: 9\n- Subtract the second number: -, 5\n- Add the third number: +, 6\n- Add the result of the fourth and fifth numbers multiplied by the sixth number: +, (, 4, +, 6, ), *, 9\n\nThus, the list representation is:\n<<<[9, -, 5, +, 6, +, (, 4, +, 6, ), *, 9]>>>"
