    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the sequence of numbers [8, 9, 3, 1, 8, 5], results in the value 100. The challenge is to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 8, 9, 3, 1, 8, 5.\n2. We need to insert operations (+, -, *, /) and possibly parentheses to achieve the target value of 100.\n3. The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n\nTo find a solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the constraints, this is a combinatorial problem that can be efficiently solved using a brute-force approach with code.\n\nLet's write a Python script to explore possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [8, 9, 3, 1, 8, 5]\ntarget = 100\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 100. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result provided two expressions that evaluate to 100 using the given numbers and operations. However, the task requires a single valid expression that meets the criteria. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. The expression `(8*(9+3))+(1+8-5)` evaluates to 100.\n2. The expression `8*((9+3)-(1/8))+5` also evaluates to 100.\n\nBoth expressions are valid solutions to the problem. However, the task requires us to return the answer in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols.\n\nLet's convert one of these expressions into the required format. I'll choose the first expression `(8*(9+3))+(1+8-5)` for this purpose.\n\nThe expression can be broken down as follows:\n- `8 * (9 + 3)` evaluates to 96.\n- `1 + 8 - 5` evaluates to 4.\n- Adding these two results gives 100.\n\nIn the required format, this expression can be represented as:\n- `8 * (9 + 3) + (1 + 8 - 5)`\n\nLet's convert this into the list format:\n\n<<<[8, *, (, 9, +, 3, ), +, (, 1, +, 8, -, 5, )]>>>"
