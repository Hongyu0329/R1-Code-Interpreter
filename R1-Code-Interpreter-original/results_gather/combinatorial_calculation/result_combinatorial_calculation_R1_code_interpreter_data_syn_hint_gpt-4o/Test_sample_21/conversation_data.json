    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 7, 4, 1, and 6 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 7, 4, 1, 6.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can use the operations: +, -, *, /, and parentheses.\n4. The target result is 78.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, it is efficient to use a programmatic approach to test different possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to explore the possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 7, 4, 1, 6]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate expressions with different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]} {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
