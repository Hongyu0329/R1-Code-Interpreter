  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 3, 9, and 3 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- Start with the expression: 5 _ 3 _ 9 _ 3\n- Try different operations and parentheses to reach 24.\n\nWe will use a systematic approach to test different combinations. Let's write a Python script to automate this process and find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [5, 3, 9, 3]\ntarget = 24\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n    # Generate expressions with different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} (({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} {numbers[3]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}))\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will test all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 24. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result shows two valid expressions that evaluate to 24 using the numbers 5, 3, 9, and 3 in the given order. These expressions are:\n\n1. \\((5 + 3) \\times (9 / 3)\\)\n2. \\((5 - 3) \\times (9 + 3)\\)\n\nBoth expressions use the numbers in the specified order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24.\n\nNow, let's format the answer according to the required format:\n\n1. For the expression \\((5 + 3) \\times (9 / 3)\\), the list of values and symbols is: \\([5, +, 3, *, (, 9, /, 3, )]\\).\n2. For the expression \\((5 - 3) \\times (9 + 3)\\), the list of values and symbols is: \\([5, -, 3, *, (, 9, +, 3, )]\\).\n\nSince both expressions are valid, we can choose either one as the final answer. Let's choose the first one for simplicity.\n\n<<<[5, +, 3, *, (, 9, /, 3, )]>>>"
