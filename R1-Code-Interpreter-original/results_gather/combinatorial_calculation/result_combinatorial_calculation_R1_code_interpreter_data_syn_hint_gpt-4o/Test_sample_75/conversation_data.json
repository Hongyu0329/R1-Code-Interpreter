  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 6, 4, 7, 2, the target values is: 24\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 6, 4, 7, and 2 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication and division, as they have higher precedence and can quickly increase or decrease the result.\n- Use addition and subtraction to adjust the result to reach the target value.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. (6 * 4) + (7 - 2) = 24\n2. (6 + 4) * (7 - 2) = 50 (not 24)\n3. (6 * 4) - (7 / 2) = 22.5 (not 24)\n4. (6 * 4) - 7 + 2 = 19 (not 24)\n5. 6 * (4 + 7 - 2) = 54 (not 24)\n\nThe first combination seems to work:\n\n- (6 * 4) + (7 - 2) = 24\n\nThis combination uses multiplication and addition, with parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<[6, *, 4, +, (, 7, -, 2, )]>>>"
