  "question": "Given 3 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 9, 4, 5, the target values is: 10\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 4, and 5 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - 9 + 4 + 5 = 18\n   - 9 + 4 - 5 = 8\n   - 9 - 4 + 5 = 10\n   - 9 - 4 - 5 = 0\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**:\n   - 9 * 4 * 5 = 180\n   - 9 * 4 / 5 = 7.2\n   - 9 / 4 * 5 = 11.25\n   - 9 / 4 / 5 = 0.45\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - (9 + 4) * 5 = 65\n   - 9 + (4 * 5) = 29\n   - (9 - 4) * 5 = 25\n   - 9 - (4 * 5) = -11\n   - (9 + 4) / 5 = 2.6\n   - 9 + (4 / 5) = 9.8\n   - (9 - 4) / 5 = 1\n   - 9 - (4 / 5) = 8.2\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the expression `9 - 4 + 5` results in 10. Therefore, the correct combination of operations is subtraction followed by addition.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[9, -, 4, +, 5]>>>"
