  "question": "Given 5 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 78. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 9, 7, 1, 1, 3, the target values is: 78\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 7, 1, 1, and 3 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and how they can be combined with parentheses to achieve the target value. We need to explore different combinations systematically.\n\n1. Start by considering the basic operations without parentheses.\n2. Introduce parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps achieve the target.\n3. Check if multiplication or division can help reach the target more effectively.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these steps:\n\n- We can start by trying to multiply some numbers to get closer to 78, as multiplication can increase the value quickly.\n- Then, we can use addition or subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 78.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [9, 7, 1, 1, 3]\ntarget = 78\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(numbers, ops):\n    expression = f\"{numbers[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        expression += f\"{ops[i-1]}{numbers[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    if evaluate_expression(numbers, ops) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4]])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will try all possible combinations of the four operations between the five numbers and check if any combination results in the target value of 78. If a valid combination is found, it will be printed."
