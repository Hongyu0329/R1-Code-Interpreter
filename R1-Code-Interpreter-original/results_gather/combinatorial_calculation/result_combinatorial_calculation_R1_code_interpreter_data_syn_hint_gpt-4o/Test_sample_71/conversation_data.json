  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 9, 2, 3, 8, the target values is: 24\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 2, 3, and 8 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps achieve the target value.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to try multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher values like 24.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (9 - 2) * (3 + 8)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- (9 - 2) = 7\n- (3 + 8) = 11\n- 7 * 11 = 77\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another combination:\n\n- 9 * 2 + 3 + 8\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 9 * 2 = 18\n- 18 + 3 = 21\n- 21 + 8 = 29\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 9 + 2 * 3 + 8\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6\n- 9 + 6 = 15\n- 15 + 8 = 23\n\nThis is close, but not quite 24. Let's try another combination:\n\n- 9 * (2 + 3) - 8\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 2 + 3 = 5\n- 9 * 5 = 45\n- 45 - 8 = 37\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try another combination:\n\n- (9 + 2) * (3 - 8)\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 9 + 2 = 11\n- 3 - 8 = -5\n- 11 * -5 = -55\n\nThis doesn't work either.

Let's try another combination:\n\n- 9 * 2 * 3 - 8\n\nNow, let's calculate this:\n\n- 9 * 2 = 18\n- 18 * 3 = 54\n- 54 - 8 = 46\n\nThis doesn't work either.
