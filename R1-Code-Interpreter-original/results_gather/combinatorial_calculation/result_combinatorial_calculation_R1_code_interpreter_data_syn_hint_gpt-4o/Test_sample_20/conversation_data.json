  "question": "Given 5 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 78. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 4, 4, 2, 9, 7, the target values is: 78\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 4, 2, 9, and 7 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 4, 4, 2, 9, 7.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 78.\n3. The order of numbers cannot be changed, so we must work with them as they are.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possibilities, we can use a brute-force approach to test different combinations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [4, 4, 2, 9, 7]\ntarget = 78\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate all possible parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the expression `(4/4)+(2+9)*7` evaluates to 78, which is the target value. This expression uses the numbers in the given order and applies arithmetic operations and parentheses correctly to achieve the desired result.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. **(4/4)**: This evaluates to 1.\n2. **(2+9)**: This evaluates to 11.\n3. **11 * 7**: This evaluates to 77.\n4. **1 + 77**: This results in 78.\n\nThe expression `(4/4)+(2+9)*7` correctly uses all the numbers in the given order and achieves the target value of 78.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[4, /, 4, +, (, 2, +, 9, ), *, 7]>>>"
