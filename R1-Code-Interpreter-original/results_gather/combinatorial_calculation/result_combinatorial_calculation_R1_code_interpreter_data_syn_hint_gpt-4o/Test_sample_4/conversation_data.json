    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 3, and 3 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations:\n\n1. Addition: 9 + 3 + 3 = 15\n2. Subtraction: 9 - 3 - 3 = 3\n3. Multiplication: 9 * 3 * 3 = 81\n4. Division: 9 / 3 / 3 = 1\n\nNone of these simple operations result in 10. We need to try combinations with parentheses and different operations.\n\nLet's try some combinations:\n\n- (9 + 3) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36\n- 9 + (3 * 3) = 9 + 9 = 18\n- 9 - (3 / 3) = 9 - 1 = 8\n- (9 / 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nNone of these combinations work. Let's try another approach:\n\n- 9 + 3 - 3 = 9\n- 9 - 3 + 3 = 9\n- (9 * 3) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9\n- 9 / (3 / 3) = 9 / 1 = 9\n\nStill not reaching 10. Let's try using division and multiplication creatively:\n\n- 9 / 3 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n- 9 / (3 / 3) = 9 / 1 = 9\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n- 9 + 3 * 3 = 9 + 9 = 18\n- 9 - 3 * 3 = 9 - 9 = 0\n- 9 * 3 - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24\n- 9 * (3 - 3) = 9 * 0 = 0\n\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n- (9 - 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18\n- 9 - (3 * 3) = 9 - 9 = 0\n- (9 / 3) * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9\n\nLet's try a combination of division and addition:\n\n- 9 / 3 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n- (9 - 3) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nLet's try using division creatively:\n\n- 9 / (3 / 3) = 9 / 1 = 9\n\nLet's try using multiplication and division:\n\n- 9 * (3 / 3) = 9 * 1 = 9\n\nLet's try using subtraction and division:\n\n- 9 - (3 / 3) = 9 - 1 = 8\n\nLet's try using addition and division:\n\n- 9 + (3 / 3) = 9 + 1 = 10\n\nThis combination works! The expression 9 + (3 / 3) results in 10.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<[9, +, (, 3, /, 3, )]>>>"
