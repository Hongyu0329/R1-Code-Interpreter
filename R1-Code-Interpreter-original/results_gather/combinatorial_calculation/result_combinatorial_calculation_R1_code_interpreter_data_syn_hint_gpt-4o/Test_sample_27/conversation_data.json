    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 2, 1, 6, 5, and 8 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 1, 6, 5, 8.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can insert any arithmetic operations and parentheses between the numbers.\n4. The result of the expression should be 78.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, we can use a brute-force approach to test different possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [2, 1, 6, 5, 8]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result provided two expressions that evaluate to 78 using the given numbers and operations. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. `((2-1)*6)*(5+8)`: This expression uses subtraction, multiplication, and addition. It evaluates as follows:\n   - `(2-1)` results in `1`.\n   - `1*6` results in `6`.\n   - `5+8` results in `13`.\n   - `6*13` results in `78`.\n\n2. `2*((1+6)*5)+8`: This expression uses addition and multiplication. It evaluates as follows:\n   - `(1+6)` results in `7`.\n   - `7*5` results in `35`.\n   - `2*35` results in `70`.\n   - `70+8` results in `78`.\n\nBoth expressions correctly use the numbers 2, 1, 6, 5, and 8 in the given order and evaluate to the target value of 78.\n\nSince the task is to find a valid expression that meets the criteria, and we have found two such expressions, we can conclude with one of them as the final answer.\n\n<<<[(2, -, 1), *, 6, *, (, 5, +, 8, )]>>>"
