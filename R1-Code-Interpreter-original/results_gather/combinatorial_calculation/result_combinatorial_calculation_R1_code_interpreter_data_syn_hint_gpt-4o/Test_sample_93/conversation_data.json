Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 78. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 3, 9, 9, and 6 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 5, 3, 9, 9, 6.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 78.\n3. The order of numbers cannot be changed, so we must work with them as they are.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, we can use a brute-force approach to test different possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the correct combination.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [5, 3, 9, 9, 6]\ntarget = 78\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the expression `(5*3+9)+(9*6)` evaluates to the target value of 78. This expression uses the numbers in the given order and applies arithmetic operations and parentheses correctly.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n1. `(5*3+9)` evaluates to 24.\n2. `(9*6)` evaluates to 54.\n3. Adding these two results: 24 + 54 = 78.\n\nThis expression satisfies the problem's requirements, using each number exactly once and achieving the target value of 78.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[5, *, 3, +, 9, +, (, 9, *, 6, )]>>>"
