  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 7, 4, 1, 3, the target values is: 24\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 4, 1, and 3 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps achieve the target value.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher values.\n- Consider using parentheses to prioritize certain operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using these strategies:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 4, 1, 3]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression with given operations\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression\n        expression = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]}{ops[2]}{nums[3]})\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n    if evaluate_expression(numbers, ops) == target:\n        # If a solution is found, print it\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')', ops[2], numbers[3]])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the expression `[7, '*', '(', 4, '-', 1, ')', '+', 3]` evaluates to 24. Let's verify this:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: \\(4 - 1 = 3\\).\n2. Multiply the result by 7: \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\).\n3. Add 3 to the result: \\(21 + 3 = 24\\).\n\nThis expression indeed evaluates to 24, which is the target value. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, '*', '(', 4, '-', 1, ')', '+', 3]>>>"
