    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 9, 4, 6, 2, and 8 in that order, result in the value 100. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to make the expression equal to 100.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find a solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the complexity of the problem, it might be helpful to use a programmatic approach to explore possible combinations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [9, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8]\ntarget = 100\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 100. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a solution.",
    "The code execution result shows several expressions that evaluate to 100 using the given numbers and operations. However, the task requires us to return the answer in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols.\n\nLet's analyze one of the expressions that evaluates to 100 and convert it into the required format. \n\nFor example, the expression `((9-9)+4)+(6*2)*8` evaluates to 100. We can break it down into a list format as follows:\n\n- Start with 9\n- Subtract 9\n- Add 4\n- Add the result of multiplying 6 and 2\n- Multiply the result by 8\n\nThis can be represented in the list format as:\n\n<<<[9, -, 9, +, 4, +, (, 6, *, 2, ), *, 8]>>>\n\nThis list format captures the operations and the use of parentheses as required.\n\nNow, let's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<[9, -, 9, +, 4, +, (, 6, *, 2, ), *, 8]>>>"
