    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 2, 2, 7, 2, and 3 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 2, 7, 2, 3.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can use the operations: +, -, *, /, and parentheses.\n4. The target result is 78.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the constraints, multiplication and division are likely to play a significant role in reaching a larger number like 78.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can significantly increase or decrease the result.\n- Use parentheses to control the order of operations and group numbers effectively.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using a systematic approach with code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# The numbers in the given order\nnumbers = [2, 2, 7, 2, 3]\n\n# The target result\ntarget = 78\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(numbers, ops):\n    expression = f\"{numbers[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        expression += f\"{ops[i-1]}{numbers[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    if evaluate_expression(numbers, ops) == target:\n        result = [numbers[0]]\n        for i in range(4):\n            result.append(ops[i])\n            result.append(numbers[i+1])\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will try all possible combinations of the four operations between the five numbers and check if any combination results in 78. If a valid combination is found, it will print the result."
