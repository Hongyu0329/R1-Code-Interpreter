    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 3, 9, 1, and 3 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations and see if it helps achieve the target value.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- Start with multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher values.\n- Use parentheses to prioritize certain operations.\n\nLet's try a few combinations manually:\n\n1. (3 * 9) + (1 * 3) = 27 + 3 = 30 (too high)\n2. (3 * (9 + 1)) - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 (too high)\n3. 3 * (9 - 1) + 3 = 3 * 8 + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27 (too high)\n4. 3 * 9 - (1 + 3) = 27 - 4 = 23 (too low)\n5. 3 * (9 - (1 - 3)) = 3 * (9 - (-2)) = 3 * 11 = 33 (too high)\n6. (3 + 9) * (1 + 3) = 12 * 4 = 48 (too high)\n7. (3 * 9) - (1 - 3) = 27 - (-2) = 27 + 2 = 29 (too high)\n8. 3 * (9 - 1) - 3 = 3 * 8 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n\nLet's try to find a solution using code to automate the process of testing different combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [3, 9, 1, 3]\ntarget = 24\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression\n        expression = f\"({nums[0]} {ops[0]} {nums[1]}) {ops[1]} ({nums[2]} {ops[2]} {nums[3]})\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        result = eval(expression)\n        return result\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n    result = evaluate_expression(numbers, ops)\n    if result == target:\n        print(f\"Solution found: {numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}\")\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a solution was found: \\(3 \\times 9 - 1 \\times 3\\). However, this expression evaluates to \\(27 - 3 = 24\\), which is indeed the correct target value. Therefore, the solution is valid.\n\nThe expression can be represented in the required format as follows: \\([3, *, 9, -, 1, *, 3]\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, *, 9, -, 1, *, 3]>>>"
