Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 78. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 7, 3, 2, 9, 8, the target values is: 78\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 3, 2, 9, and 8 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 7, 3, 2, 9, 8.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 78.\n3. The order of numbers cannot be changed, so we must work with them as they are.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, it is efficient to use a programmatic approach to test different possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to explore different combinations and find the one that results in 78.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 3, 2, 9, 8]\ntarget = 78\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Create the expression with the current combination of operations\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    \n    # Evaluate the expression\n    if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n        print(expr)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of the four operations between the five numbers and check if any combination results in 78. If it finds a valid expression, it will print it. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result provided a valid expression, `7-3+2+9*8`, which evaluates to 78. This expression uses the numbers in the given order and applies arithmetic operations to achieve the target value.\n\nLet's verify the expression step by step:\n\n1. Start with the expression: `7 - 3 + 2 + 9 * 8`\n2. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication is performed before addition and subtraction.\n3. Calculate `9 * 8 = 72`.\n4. Substitute back into the expression: `7 - 3 + 2 + 72`.\n5. Perform the operations from left to right:\n   - `7 - 3 = 4`\n   - `4 + 2 = 6`\n   - `6 + 72 = 78`\n\nThe expression correctly evaluates to 78, satisfying the problem's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[7, -, 3, +, 2, +, 9, *, 8]>>>"
