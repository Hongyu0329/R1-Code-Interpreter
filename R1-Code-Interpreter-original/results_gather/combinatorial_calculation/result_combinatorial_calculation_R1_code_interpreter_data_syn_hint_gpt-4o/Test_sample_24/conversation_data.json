    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the numbers 8, 4, 5, 7, and 4 to achieve the target value of 78. The order of the numbers cannot be changed, and each number must be used exactly once.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 8, 4, 5, 7, 4.\n2. We need to use arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n3. We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n4. The goal is to reach the target value of 78.\n\nTo find a solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, it is efficient to use a programmatic approach to explore the possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [8, 4, 5, 7, 4]\ntarget = 78\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the expression `8*(4+(5*7))/4` evaluates to the target value of 78. This expression uses the numbers 8, 4, 5, 7, and 4 in the given order, with the operations and parentheses inserted appropriately to achieve the desired result.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n- Start with the innermost parentheses: `5*7` which equals 35.\n- Add 4 to the result: `4 + 35` which equals 39.\n- Multiply the result by 8: `8 * 39` which equals 312.\n- Finally, divide by 4: `312 / 4` which equals 78.\n\nThis confirms that the expression is correct and meets the problem's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[8, *, (, 4, +, (, 5, *, 7, ), ), /, 4]>>>"
