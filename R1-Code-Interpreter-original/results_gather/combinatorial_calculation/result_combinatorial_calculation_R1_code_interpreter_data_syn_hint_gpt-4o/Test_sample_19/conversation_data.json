    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 1, 6, and 6 in that order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to use multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- (4 * 6) + (6 / 1)\n\nThis combination uses multiplication to increase the value quickly and then addition to reach the target value. Let's calculate this:\n\n- (4 * 6) = 24\n- (6 / 1) = 6\n- 24 + 6 = 30\n\nThis result is not 24, so let's try another combination.\n\n- (4 * 6) - (6 / 1)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (4 * 6) = 24\n- (6 / 1) = 6\n- 24 - 6 = 18\n\nThis result is not 24 either. Let's try another combination.\n\n- (4 * 6) - 6 + 1\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n- (4 * 6) = 24\n- 24 - 6 = 18\n- 18 + 1 = 19\n\nThis result is not 24.
