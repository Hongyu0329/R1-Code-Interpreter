    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 8, 5, 3, and 2 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 5, 8, 5, 3, 2.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can insert any arithmetic operations and parentheses between the numbers.\n4. The goal is to reach the target value of 78.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since the problem is complex and involves multiple operations, it might be helpful to use a systematic approach or a brute-force method to test various combinations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and find the correct combination of operations and parentheses.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [5, 8, 5, 3, 2]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Try different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result shows two expressions that evaluate to 78 using the given numbers and operations. However, the task requires us to return the solution in a specific format, which is a list of values and symbols.\n\nLet's convert the found expressions into the required format:\n\n1. The expression `5*(8+(5+3))-2` can be represented as:\n   - 5 * (8 + (5 + 3)) - 2\n   - In list format: <<<[5, *, (, 8, +, (, 5, +, 3, ), ), -, 2]>>>\n\n2. The expression `(5*8)*(5-3)-2` can be represented as:\n   - (5 * 8) * (5 - 3) - 2\n   - In list format: <<<[(, 5, *, 8, ), *, (, 5, -, 3, ), -, 2]>>>\n\nSince both expressions are valid solutions, we can choose either one to present as the final answer. Let's choose the first one for simplicity.\n\n<<<[5, *, (, 8, +, (, 5, +, 3, ), ), -, 2]>>>"
