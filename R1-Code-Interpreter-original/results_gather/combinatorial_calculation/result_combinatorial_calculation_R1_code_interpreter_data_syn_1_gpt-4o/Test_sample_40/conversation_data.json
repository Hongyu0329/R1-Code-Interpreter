  "question": "Given 6 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 100. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 9, the target values is: 100\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 5, 6, 4, 6, and 9 in that order, result in the value 100. We can use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to achieve the target value.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use the operations +, -, *, and /, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Brute Force Approach**: We will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if we can achieve the target value of 100.\n\n3. **Constraints**: Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order. We cannot change the order of the numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We will write a Python script to try different combinations and check if any of them result in 100.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 9]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression with given operations and parentheses\ndef evaluate_expression(ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression with operations\n        expression = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    if evaluate_expression(ops) == 100:\n        # If the expression evaluates to 100, print the operations\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4], ops[4], numbers[5]])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will try all possible combinations of the four operations between the six numbers and check if any combination results in 100. If it finds a valid combination, it will print it. Let's execute this code to find the solution."
