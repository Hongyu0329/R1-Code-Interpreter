    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 4, 7, and 8 in the given order, result in the value 24. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [4, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=3):\n    # Without parentheses\n    expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr1) == 24:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3]])\n        break\n    \n    # With parentheses around first two numbers\n    expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr2) == 24:\n        print(['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ')', ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3]])\n        break\n    \n    # With parentheses around last two numbers\n    expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr3) == 24:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], '(', numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ')'])\n        break\n    \n    # With parentheses around middle two numbers\n    expr4 = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr4) == 24:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')', ops[2], numbers[3]])\n        break\n    \n    # With parentheses around first three numbers\n    expr5 = f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr5) == 24:\n        print(['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')', ops[2], numbers[3]])\n        break\n    \n    # With parentheses around last three numbers\n    expr6 = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr6) == 24:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ')'])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that the expression `4 + 4 * 7 - 8` evaluates to 24. Let's verify this:\n\n- According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication is performed before addition and subtraction.\n- So, the expression is evaluated as follows:\n  - First, calculate `4 * 7 = 28`.\n  - Then, add `4 + 28 = 32`.\n  - Finally, subtract `32 - 8 = 24`.\n\nThis confirms that the expression is correct and evaluates to 24.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[4, '+', 4, '*', 7, '-', 8]>>>"
