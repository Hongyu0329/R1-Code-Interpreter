    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 6, 3, and 7 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - 6 + 3 + 7 = 16\n   - 6 + 3 - 7 = 2\n   - 6 - 3 + 7 = 10\n   - 6 - 3 - 7 = -4\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**:\n   - 6 * 3 * 7 = 126\n   - 6 * 3 / 7 = 18/7 (not an integer)\n   - 6 / 3 * 7 = 14\n   - 6 / 3 / 7 = 2/7 (not an integer)\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - (6 + 3) * 7 = 63\n   - (6 - 3) * 7 = 21\n   - 6 * (3 + 7) = 60\n   - 6 * (3 - 7) = -24\n   - (6 + 3) / 7 = 9/7 (not an integer)\n   - (6 - 3) / 7 = 3/7 (not an integer)\n   - 6 / (3 + 7) = 6/10 (not an integer)\n   - 6 / (3 - 7) = -3/2 (not an integer)\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the combination 6 - 3 + 7 results in 10. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<[6, -, 3, +, 7]>>>"
