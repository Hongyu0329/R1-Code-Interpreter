    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 1, and 4 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - 7 + 1 + 4 = 12\n   - 7 + 1 - 4 = 4\n   - 7 - 1 + 4 = 10\n   - 7 - 1 - 4 = 2\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**:\n   - 7 * 1 * 4 = 28\n   - 7 * 1 / 4 = 1.75\n   - 7 / 1 * 4 = 28\n   - 7 / 1 / 4 = 1.75\n\n3. **Combinations with Parentheses**:\n   - (7 + 1) * 4 = 32\n   - (7 - 1) * 4 = 24\n   - 7 * (1 + 4) = 35\n   - 7 * (1 - 4) = -21\n   - (7 + 1) / 4 = 2\n   - (7 - 1) / 4 = 1.5\n   - 7 / (1 + 4) = 1.4\n   - 7 / (1 - 4) = -2.333\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the combination 7 - 1 + 4 results in 10. Therefore, the correct sequence of operations is subtraction followed by addition.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\na = 7\nb = 1\nc = 4\n\n# Calculate the result using the identified operations\nresult = a - b + c\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we confirm that the result is indeed 10. Therefore, the correct sequence of operations is:\n\n<<<[7, -, 1, +, 4]>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result is 10, confirming that the correct sequence of operations is subtraction followed by addition. Therefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[7, -, 1, +, 4]>>>"
