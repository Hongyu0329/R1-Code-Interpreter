    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 8, 5, 3, and 2 in that order, result in the value 78. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: We must use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can only insert operations and parentheses.\n\n2. **Explore possible operations**: We need to consider how different operations affect the numbers. Multiplication and division have a more significant impact on the result than addition and subtraction, so they might be crucial in reaching the target value of 78.\n\n3. **Use parentheses wisely**: Parentheses can change the order of operations, which might be necessary to reach the target value.\n\n4. **Trial and error with logic**: We can try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 78.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [5, 8, 5, 3, 2]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Try different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides two valid expressions that evaluate to 78 using the given numbers and operations. Let's break down these expressions:\n\n1. **Expression 1**: `(5+8)*(5+3-2)`\n   - This expression evaluates as follows:\n     - First, calculate inside the parentheses: \\(5 + 8 = 13\\) and \\(5 + 3 - 2 = 6\\).\n     - Then, multiply the results: \\(13 \\times 6 = 78\\).\n\n2. **Expression 2**: `((5*8)*(5-3))-2`\n   - This expression evaluates as follows:\n     - First, calculate inside the parentheses: \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\) and \\(5 - 3 = 2\\).\n     - Then, multiply the results: \\(40 \\times 2 = 80\\).\n     - Finally, subtract 2: \\(80 - 2 = 78\\).\n\nBoth expressions correctly use the numbers in the given order and achieve the target value of 78.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[(5, +, 8), *, (, 5, +, 3, -, 2, )]>>>"
