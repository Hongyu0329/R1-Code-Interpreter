    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 2, 2, 7, 2, and 3 in that order, result in the value 78. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 2, 7, 2, 3.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to achieve the result of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo approach this, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since the numbers are fixed in order, we can only manipulate the operations and the placement of parentheses.\n\nLet's try to find a solution using a systematic approach by generating possible combinations of operations and checking if they result in 78.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [2, 2, 7, 2, 3]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression with given operations and parentheses\ndef evaluate_expression(ops):\n    try:\n        # Construct the expression with the current operations\n        expression = f\"(({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\"\n        # Evaluate the expression\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    if evaluate_expression(ops) == 78:\n        # If the expression evaluates to 78, print the operations\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4]])\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will try different combinations of operations and check if any of them result in 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
