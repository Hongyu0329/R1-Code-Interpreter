    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 2, and 4 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. Direct operations without parentheses:\n   - 5 + 2 + 4\n   - 5 + 2 - 4\n   - 5 + 2 * 4\n   - 5 + 2 / 4\n   - 5 - 2 + 4\n   - 5 - 2 - 4\n   - 5 - 2 * 4\n   - 5 - 2 / 4\n   - 5 * 2 + 4\n   - 5 * 2 - 4\n   - 5 * 2 * 4\n   - 5 * 2 / 4\n   - 5 / 2 + 4\n   - 5 / 2 - 4\n   - 5 / 2 * 4\n   - 5 / 2 / 4\n\n2. Operations with parentheses:\n   - (5 + 2) + 4\n   - (5 + 2) - 4\n   - (5 + 2) * 4\n   - (5 + 2) / 4\n   - (5 - 2) + 4\n   - (5 - 2) - 4\n   - (5 - 2) * 4\n   - (5 - 2) / 4\n   - (5 * 2) + 4\n   - (5 * 2) - 4\n   - (5 * 2) * 4\n   - (5 * 2) / 4\n   - (5 / 2) + 4\n   - (5 / 2) - 4\n   - (5 / 2) * 4\n   - (5 / 2) / 4\n   - 5 + (2 + 4)\n   - 5 + (2 - 4)\n   - 5 + (2 * 4)\n   - 5 + (2 / 4)\n   - 5 - (2 + 4)\n   - 5 - (2 - 4)\n   - 5 - (2 * 4)\n   - 5 - (2 / 4)\n   - 5 * (2 + 4)\n   - 5 * (2 - 4)\n   - 5 * (2 * 4)\n   - 5 * (2 / 4)\n   - 5 / (2 + 4)\n   - 5 / (2 - 4)\n   - 5 / (2 * 4)\n   - 5 / (2 / 4)\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to evaluate these expressions and find the one that equals 10.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\nnumbers = [5, 2, 4]\ntarget = 10\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\ndef find_expression(numbers, target):\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n        # Without parentheses\n        expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n        if evaluate_expression(expr1) == target:\n            return expr1\n\n        # With parentheses\n        expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n        if evaluate_expression(expr2) == target:\n            return expr2\n\n        expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n        if evaluate_expression(expr3) == target:\n            return expr3\n\n    return None\n\nexpression = find_expression(numbers, target)\nprint(expression)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct expression.",
    "The code output indicates that the expression `5 / 2 * 4` evaluates to 10. Let's break down this expression:\n\n- First, `5 / 2` is evaluated, which results in `2.5`.\n- Then, `2.5 * 4` is evaluated, which results in `10.0`.\n\nThis expression correctly uses the numbers 5, 2, and 4 in the given order and achieves the target value of 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is:\n\n<<<[5, /, 2, *, 4]>>>"
