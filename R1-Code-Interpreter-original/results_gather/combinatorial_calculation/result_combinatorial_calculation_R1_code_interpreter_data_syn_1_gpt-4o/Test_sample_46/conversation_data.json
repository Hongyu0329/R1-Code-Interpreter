  "question": "Given 6 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 100. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 6, 2, 5, 2, 1, 4, the target values is: 100\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 6, 2, 5, 2, 1, and 4 in that order, result in the value 100. We can use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to achieve the target value.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Operations**: The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Generate Combinations**: We need to generate all possible combinations of these operations and parentheses between the numbers. Since there are 5 gaps between the 6 numbers, we have to fill each gap with one of the operations or parentheses.\n\n3. **Evaluate Expressions**: For each combination, evaluate the expression to see if it equals 100.\n\n4. **Return the Correct Expression**: Once we find an expression that evaluates to 100, we return it in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [6, 2, 5, 2, 1, 4]\ntarget = 100\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Create the expression string\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n    \n    # Evaluate the expression\n    if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n        # If the expression evaluates to the target, print the expression\n        print(expr)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of operations between the numbers and check if any of them result in 100. If it finds a valid expression, it will print it. Let's execute this code to find the solution."
