    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 8, 2, 4, and 4 in that order, result in the value 69. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 7, 8, 2, 4, 4.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can insert any arithmetic operations and parentheses between the numbers.\n4. The goal is to reach the result of 69.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. A systematic approach would be to use a brute-force method to try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses, but this can be computationally expensive. Instead, we can try to reason through possible combinations that might work.\n\nLet's start by considering the operations that can significantly increase the value, such as multiplication and addition, and see if we can reach 69.\n\nWe can try a few combinations manually:\n\n- Start with multiplication to increase the value quickly.\n- Use addition to reach the target value.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that works:\n\n1. Start with multiplication: \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n2. Add the next number: \\(56 + 2 = 58\\)\n3. Add the next number: \\(58 + 4 = 62\\)\n4. Add the last number: \\(62 + 4 = 66\\)\n\nThis doesn't reach 69, so let's try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n- Try using parentheses to group operations differently.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Multiply the first two numbers: \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n2. Add the next number: \\(56 + 2 = 58\\)\n3. Multiply the result by the next number: \\(58 \\times 4 = 232\\)\n4. Divide by the last number: \\(232 / 4 = 58\\)\n\nThis still doesn't reach 69. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Multiply the first two numbers: \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n2. Add the next number: \\(56 + 2 = 58\\)\n3. Add the next number: \\(58 + 4 = 62\\)\n4. Add the last number: \\(62 + 4 = 66\\)\n\nThis still doesn't reach 69.
