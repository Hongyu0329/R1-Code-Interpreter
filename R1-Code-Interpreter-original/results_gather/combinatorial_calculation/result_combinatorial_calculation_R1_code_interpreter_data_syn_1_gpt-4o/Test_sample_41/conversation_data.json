    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the sequence of numbers [6, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6], results in the value 100. The challenge is to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's break down the approach:\n\n1. **Brute Force Approach**: We can try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses. However, this can be computationally expensive due to the large number of possibilities.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We have four operations (+, -, *, /) and can place parentheses in various positions to change the order of operations.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: We can write a script to iterate through all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find a valid expression that evaluates to 100.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [6, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6]\ntarget = 100\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}(({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will iterate through all possible combinations of operations and parentheses, evaluate each expression, and print the one that equals 100. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that there are two expressions that evaluate to 100 using the given numbers and operations. Let's break down these expressions:\n\n1. **Expression 1**: `(6+4)-(5-(4*5))*6`\n   - This expression uses addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n   - The parentheses dictate the order of operations, ensuring the correct evaluation to reach 100.\n\n2. **Expression 2**: `(6*4)*(5+(4*5))/6`\n   - This expression uses multiplication, addition, and division.\n   - Again, parentheses are used to control the order of operations to achieve the target value.\n\nBoth expressions are valid solutions to the problem. Now, let's format the answer according to the required format:\n\n- For the first expression: `(6+4)-(5-(4*5))*6` translates to the list `[6, +, 4, -, (, 5, -, (, 4, *, 5, ), ), *, 6]`.\n- For the second expression: `(6*4)*(5+(4*5))/6` translates to the list `[(, 6, *, 4, ), *, (, 5, +, (, 4, *, 5, ), ), /, 6]`.\n\nLet's provide the final answer:\n\n<<<[[6, +, 4, -, (, 5, -, (, 4, *, 5, ), ), *, 6], [(, 6, *, 4, ), *, (, 5, +, (, 4, *, 5, ), ), /, 6]]>>>"
