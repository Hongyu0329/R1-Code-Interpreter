    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 7, 1, 1, and 3 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 7, 1, 1, 3.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach with all possible combinations of operations and parentheses is feasible. However, we need to ensure that the operations are valid (e.g., no division by zero).\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and check if any of them result in 78.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 7, 1, 1, 3]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found an expression that evaluates to 78 using the given numbers and operations. The expression is:\n\n9 * ((7 + 1) + 1) - 3\n\nThis expression uses the numbers 9, 7, 1, 1, and 3 in the given order and applies the operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 78.\n\nThe list of values and symbols representing this expression is:\n\n<<<[9, *, (, (, 7, +, 1, ), +, 1, ), -, 3]>>>"
