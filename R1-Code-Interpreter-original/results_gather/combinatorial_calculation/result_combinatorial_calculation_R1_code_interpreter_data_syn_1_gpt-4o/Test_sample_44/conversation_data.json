  "question": "Given 6 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 100. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the sequence of numbers [9, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8], results in the value 100. The challenge is to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's break down the approach:\n\n1. **Brute Force Approach**: We can try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses. However, this can be computationally expensive due to the large number of possibilities.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We have four operations (+, -, *, /) and can use parentheses to change the order of operations. The parentheses can be placed in various positions to alter the computation order.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: We will iterate through possible combinations of operations and placements of parentheses to find a valid expression that evaluates to 100.\n\n4. **Python Code**: We will write a Python script to automate the testing of different combinations. The script will evaluate each expression and check if it equals 100.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [9, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8]\ntarget = 100\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression with error handling for division by zero\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}(({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will generate all possible combinations of operations and parentheses, evaluate them, and print the expression that equals 100. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides several expressions that evaluate to 100 using the given numbers and operations. However, the task is to find a single valid expression that meets the criteria. Let's analyze the output to identify a correct expression:\n\n1. **Expression Analysis**: We need to ensure that each expression uses the numbers in the given order and evaluates to 100.\n\n2. **Valid Expression**: From the output, we need to verify which expression correctly uses the numbers in the order [9, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8] and evaluates to 100.\n\nLet's verify the expressions:\n\n- `((9+9)-4)*6+(2*8)` evaluates to 100.\n- `(9-9)+(4+6)*(2+8)` evaluates to 100.\n- `((9-9)+4)+(6*2)*8` evaluates to 100.\n- `(9-(9-4))+(6*2)*8` evaluates to 100.\n- `((9*9)*4)/(6/2)-8` evaluates to 100.\n- `(9/9)*(4+6)*(2+8)` evaluates to 100.\n- `((9/9)*4)+(6*2)*8` evaluates to 100.\n- `9/(9/(4+6))*(2+8)` evaluates to 100.\n- `(9/(9/4))+(6*2)*8` evaluates to 100.\n\nAll these expressions are valid and evaluate to 100. However, we need to select one that uses the numbers in the given order and adheres to the problem constraints.\n\nLet's choose the first valid expression from the output:\n\n<<<[((9+9)-4)*6+(2*8)]>>>"
