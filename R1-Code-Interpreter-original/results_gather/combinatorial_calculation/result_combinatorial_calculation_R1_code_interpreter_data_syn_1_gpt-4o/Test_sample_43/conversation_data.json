    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 2, 5, 9, 1, 8, and 1 in that order, result in the value 100. The challenge is to use each number exactly once and only once, and we cannot change the order of the numbers.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 5, 9, 1, 8, 1.\n2. We need to insert operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses to achieve the target value of 100.\n3. We must respect the order of the numbers.\n\nTo approach this, we can use a brute-force method to try different combinations of operations and parentheses. However, given the constraints, we should aim for an efficient way to explore possible solutions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to explore possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [2, 5, 9, 1, 8, 1]\ntarget = 100\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Construct the expression without parentheses\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n    if safe_eval(expr) == target:\n        print(f\"Solution without parentheses: {expr}\")\n\n    # Try adding parentheses in different positions\n    for i in range(1, 6):\n        for j in range(i+1, 7):\n            expr_with_parens = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n            if safe_eval(expr_with_parens) == target:\n                print(f\"Solution with parentheses: {expr_with_parens}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution that evaluates to 100. Let's execute the code to see if it finds a valid expression.",
    "The code has successfully found a solution without the need for parentheses: `2*5*9+1+8+1`. This expression evaluates to 100, using each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n\n- \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n- \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\)\n- \\(90 + 1 = 91\\)\n- \\(91 + 8 = 99\\)\n- \\(99 + 1 = 100\\)\n\nThe expression correctly evaluates to 100.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[2, *, 5, *, 9, +, 1, +, 8, +, 1]>>>"
