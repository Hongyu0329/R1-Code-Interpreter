Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 8, 5, 3, the target values is: 10\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 8, 5, and 3 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - 8 + 5 + 3 = 16\n   - 8 + 5 - 3 = 10\n   - 8 - 5 + 3 = 6\n   - 8 - 5 - 3 = 0\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**:\n   - 8 * 5 * 3 = 120\n   - 8 * 5 / 3 = 13.33\n   - 8 / 5 * 3 = 4.8\n   - 8 / 5 / 3 = 0.53\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - (8 + 5) * 3 = 39\n   - (8 - 5) * 3 = 9\n   - 8 * (5 + 3) = 64\n   - 8 * (5 - 3) = 16\n   - (8 + 5) / 3 = 4.33\n   - (8 - 5) / 3 = 1\n   - 8 / (5 + 3) = 1\n   - 8 / (5 - 3) = 4\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the combination 8 + 5 - 3 results in 10. Therefore, the solution is to use addition and subtraction without any parentheses.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Calculation to confirm the result\nresult = 8 + 5 - 3\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm that the result is indeed 10. Therefore, the correct combination of operations is:\n\n<<<[8, +, 5, -, 3]>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, and the result is indeed 10. Therefore, the correct combination of operations to achieve the target value of 10 using the numbers 8, 5, and 3 in that order is:\n\n<<<[8, +, 5, -, 3]>>>"
