  "question": "Given 3 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 4, 4, 2, the target values is: 10\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 4, and 2 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations:\n\n1. Addition: 4 + 4 + 2 = 10\n2. Subtraction: 4 - 4 + 2, 4 + 4 - 2, etc.\n3. Multiplication: 4 * 4 * 2, etc.\n4. Division: 4 / 4 + 2, etc.\n5. Parentheses: (4 + 4) * 2, etc.\n\nWe need to try different combinations of these operations to see which one results in 10. Let's write a Python script to automate this process.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [4, 4, 2]\ntarget = 10\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    # Without parentheses\n    expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr1) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    # With parentheses around first two numbers\n    expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr2) == target:\n        print(['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ')', ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    # With parentheses around last two numbers\n    expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr3) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')'])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output provides three valid expressions that evaluate to 10 using the numbers 4, 4, and 2 in the given order. Each expression uses arithmetic operations and parentheses as needed:\n\n1. The first expression is straightforward addition: 4 + 4 + 2 = 10.\n2. The second expression uses parentheses to group the first two numbers: (4 + 4) + 2 = 10.\n3. The third expression uses parentheses to group the last two numbers: 4 + (4 + 2) = 10.\n\nAll three expressions are valid solutions to the problem. Therefore, the final answer can be any of these expressions. Let's choose the first one for simplicity.\n\n<<<[4, '+', 4, '+', 2]>>>"
