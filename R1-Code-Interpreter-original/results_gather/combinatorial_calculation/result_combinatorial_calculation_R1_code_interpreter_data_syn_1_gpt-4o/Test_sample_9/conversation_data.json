Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 7, and 2 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try simple operations first:\n   - 1 + 7 + 2 = 10\n   - 1 + 7 - 2\n   - 1 + 7 * 2\n   - 1 + 7 / 2\n   - 1 - 7 + 2\n   - 1 - 7 - 2\n   - 1 - 7 * 2\n   - 1 - 7 / 2\n   - 1 * 7 + 2\n   - 1 * 7 - 2\n   - 1 * 7 * 2\n   - 1 * 7 / 2\n   - 1 / 7 + 2\n   - 1 / 7 - 2\n   - 1 / 7 * 2\n   - 1 / 7 / 2\n\n2. We can also try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n   - (1 + 7) + 2\n   - (1 + 7) - 2\n   - (1 + 7) * 2\n   - (1 + 7) / 2\n   - (1 - 7) + 2\n   - (1 - 7) - 2\n   - (1 - 7) * 2\n   - (1 - 7) / 2\n   - (1 * 7) + 2\n   - (1 * 7) - 2\n   - (1 * 7) * 2\n   - (1 * 7) / 2\n   - (1 / 7) + 2\n   - (1 / 7) - 2\n   - (1 / 7) * 2\n   - (1 / 7) / 2\n   - 1 + (7 + 2)\n   - 1 + (7 - 2)\n   - 1 + (7 * 2)\n   - 1 + (7 / 2)\n   - 1 - (7 + 2)\n   - 1 - (7 - 2)\n   - 1 - (7 * 2)\n   - 1 - (7 / 2)\n   - 1 * (7 + 2)\n   - 1 * (7 - 2)\n   - 1 * (7 * 2)\n   - 1 * (7 / 2)\n   - 1 / (7 + 2)\n   - 1 / (7 - 2)\n   - 1 / (7 * 2)\n   - 1 / (7 / 2)\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to evaluate these expressions and find the one that equals 10.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [1, 7, 2]\ntarget = 10\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible expressions with operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    \n    if evaluate_expression(expr1) == target:\n        print(expr1)\n    if evaluate_expression(expr2) == target:\n        print(expr2)\n    if evaluate_expression(expr3) == target:\n        print(expr3)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct expression.",
    "The code output indicates that there are multiple expressions that evaluate to 10 using the numbers 1, 7, and 2 in the given order. The expressions are:\n\n1. `1 + 7 + 2`\n2. `(1 + 7) + 2`\n3. `1 + (7 + 2)`\n\nAll these expressions are equivalent and result in the value 10. Therefore, any of these can be considered a valid solution.\n\nThe errors section is empty, indicating that there were no errors during the execution of the code.\n\nBased on the output, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[1, +, 7, +, 2]>>>"
