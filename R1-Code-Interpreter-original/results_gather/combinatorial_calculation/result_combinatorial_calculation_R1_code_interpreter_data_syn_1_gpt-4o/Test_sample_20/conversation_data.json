    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 4, 2, 9, and 7 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 4, 4, 2, 9, 7.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to get the result of 78.\n3. The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n\nTo solve this, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, we can use a brute-force approach to try all possible combinations and check if any of them result in 78.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [4, 4, 2, 9, 7]\ntarget = 78\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses and print the expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a combination of operations and parentheses that results in the target value of 78. The expression `(4/4)+(2+9)*7` evaluates to 78.\n\nNow, let's format the answer according to the required format, which is a list of values and symbols.\n\nThe expression `(4/4)+(2+9)*7` can be broken down into the following list:\n\n- 4\n- /\n- 4\n- +\n- (\n- 2\n- +\n- 9\n- )\n- *\n- 7\n\nSo, the formatted answer is:\n\n<<<[4, /, 4, +, (, 2, +, 9, ), *, 7]>>>"
