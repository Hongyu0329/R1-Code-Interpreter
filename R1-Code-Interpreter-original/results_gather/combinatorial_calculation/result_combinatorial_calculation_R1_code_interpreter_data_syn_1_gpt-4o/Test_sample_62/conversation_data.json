    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 8, and 5 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. Direct operations without parentheses:\n   - 7 + 8 + 5\n   - 7 + 8 - 5\n   - 7 + 8 * 5\n   - 7 + 8 / 5\n   - 7 - 8 + 5\n   - 7 - 8 - 5\n   - 7 - 8 * 5\n   - 7 - 8 / 5\n   - 7 * 8 + 5\n   - 7 * 8 - 5\n   - 7 * 8 * 5\n   - 7 * 8 / 5\n   - 7 / 8 + 5\n   - 7 / 8 - 5\n   - 7 / 8 * 5\n   - 7 / 8 / 5\n\n2. Operations with parentheses:\n   - (7 + 8) + 5\n   - (7 + 8) - 5\n   - (7 + 8) * 5\n   - (7 + 8) / 5\n   - (7 - 8) + 5\n   - (7 - 8) - 5\n   - (7 - 8) * 5\n   - (7 - 8) / 5\n   - (7 * 8) + 5\n   - (7 * 8) - 5\n   - (7 * 8) * 5\n   - (7 * 8) / 5\n   - (7 / 8) + 5\n   - (7 / 8) - 5\n   - (7 / 8) * 5\n   - (7 / 8) / 5\n   - 7 + (8 + 5)\n   - 7 + (8 - 5)\n   - 7 + (8 * 5)\n   - 7 + (8 / 5)\n   - 7 - (8 + 5)\n   - 7 - (8 - 5)\n   - 7 - (8 * 5)\n   - 7 - (8 / 5)\n   - 7 * (8 + 5)\n   - 7 * (8 - 5)\n   - 7 * (8 * 5)\n   - 7 * (8 / 5)\n   - 7 / (8 + 5)\n   - 7 / (8 - 5)\n   - 7 / (8 * 5)\n   - 7 / (8 / 5)\n\nGiven the number of possibilities, it is efficient to use a programmatic approach to evaluate each expression and check if it equals 10. Let's write a Python script to do this.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 8, 5]\ntarget = 10\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible expressions\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    # Without parentheses\n    expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr1) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    # With parentheses\n    expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr2) == target:\n        print(['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ')', ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr3) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')'])\n```\n\nThis script will evaluate all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find the one that results in 10. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that there are three valid expressions that evaluate to 10 using the numbers 7, 8, and 5 in the given order. These expressions are:\n\n1. \\(7 + 8 - 5\\)\n2. \\((7 + 8) - 5\\)\n3. \\(7 + (8 - 5)\\)\n\nEach of these expressions uses the numbers exactly once and in the given order, and they all evaluate to the target value of 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, '+', 8, '-', 5]>>>"
