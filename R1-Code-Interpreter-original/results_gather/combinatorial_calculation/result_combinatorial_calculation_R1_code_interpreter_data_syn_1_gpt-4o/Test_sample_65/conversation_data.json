    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 2, and 5 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. Direct operations without parentheses:\n   - 4 + 2 + 5\n   - 4 + 2 - 5\n   - 4 + 2 * 5\n   - 4 + 2 / 5\n   - 4 - 2 + 5\n   - 4 - 2 - 5\n   - 4 - 2 * 5\n   - 4 - 2 / 5\n   - 4 * 2 + 5\n   - 4 * 2 - 5\n   - 4 * 2 * 5\n   - 4 * 2 / 5\n   - 4 / 2 + 5\n   - 4 / 2 - 5\n   - 4 / 2 * 5\n   - 4 / 2 / 5\n\n2. Operations with parentheses:\n   - (4 + 2) + 5\n   - (4 + 2) - 5\n   - (4 + 2) * 5\n   - (4 + 2) / 5\n   - (4 - 2) + 5\n   - (4 - 2) - 5\n   - (4 - 2) * 5\n   - (4 - 2) / 5\n   - (4 * 2) + 5\n   - (4 * 2) - 5\n   - (4 * 2) * 5\n   - (4 * 2) / 5\n   - (4 / 2) + 5\n   - (4 / 2) - 5\n   - (4 / 2) * 5\n   - (4 / 2) / 5\n   - 4 + (2 + 5)\n   - 4 + (2 - 5)\n   - 4 + (2 * 5)\n   - 4 + (2 / 5)\n   - 4 - (2 + 5)\n   - 4 - (2 - 5)\n   - 4 - (2 * 5)\n   - 4 - (2 / 5)\n   - 4 * (2 + 5)\n   - 4 * (2 - 5)\n   - 4 * (2 * 5)\n   - 4 * (2 / 5)\n   - 4 / (2 + 5)\n   - 4 / (2 - 5)\n   - 4 / (2 * 5)\n   - 4 / (2 / 5)\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to evaluate these expressions and find the one that equals 10.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\nnumbers = [4, 2, 5]\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\nparentheses_positions = [\n    (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2),  # No parentheses\n    (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3),  # Parentheses around first two\n    (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4),  # Parentheses around last two\n    (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5),  # Parentheses around all\n]\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops, parens):\n    expr = f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]}\"\n    if parens == (0, 3):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}\"\n    elif parens == (1, 3):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (2, 3):\n        expr = f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (3, 3):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (0, 4):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}\"\n    elif parens == (1, 4):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (2, 4):\n        expr = f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (3, 4):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (0, 5):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}{nums[2]}\"\n    elif parens == (1, 5):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (2, 5):\n        expr = f\"{nums[0]}{ops[0]}({nums[1]}{ops[1]}{nums[2]})\"\n    elif parens == (3, 5):\n        expr = f\"({nums[0]}{ops[0]}{nums[1]}){ops[1]}({nums[2]})\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    for parens in parentheses_positions:\n        if evaluate_expression(numbers, ops, parens) == 10:\n            print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2]])\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will evaluate all possible combinations of operations and parentheses and print the one that results in 10. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that there are multiple expressions that evaluate to 10 using the numbers 4, 2, and 5 in the given order. However, the task is to find a single valid expression that results in 10. Let's analyze the outputs:\n\n1. [4, '-', 2, '*', 5] translates to \\(4 - 2 \\times 5\\). This evaluates to \\(4 - 10 = -6\\), which is incorrect.\n2. [4, '/', 2, '*', 5] translates to \\(4 / 2 \\times 5\\). This evaluates to \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\), which is correct.\n3. [4, '/', 2, '/', 5] translates to \\(4 / 2 / 5\\). This evaluates to \\(0.4\\), which is incorrect.\n\nThe correct expression that evaluates to 10 is the second one: \\(4 / 2 \\times 5\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<[4, '/', 2, '*', 5]>>>"
