    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the sequence of numbers [9, 6, 1, 7, 1, 3], results in the value 100. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nThe challenge is to use each number exactly once and in the given order, while finding the correct combination of operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 100.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 6, 1, 7, 1, 3.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to make the expression equal to 100.\n3. We must respect the order of the numbers.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a brute-force approach to try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses. However, this can be computationally expensive. Instead, we can use a more strategic approach by considering the possible operations and evaluating the results.\n\nLet's write a Python script to explore possible combinations and check if any of them result in 100.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [9, 6, 1, 7, 1, 3]\ntarget = 100\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate the expression with the current combination of operations\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\"\n    \n    # Evaluate the expression\n    result = evaluate_expression(expr)\n    \n    # Check if the result matches the target\n    if result == target:\n        print(f\"Expression: {expr} = {result}\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of the four operations between the numbers and check if any combination results in 100. If a valid expression is found, it will print the expression and stop. Let's execute this code to find the solution."
