    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 9, 4, 9, and 7 in that order, result in the value 69. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 1, 9, 4, 9, 7.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to achieve the result of 69.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, we can use a brute-force approach to test different possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [1, 9, 4, 9, 7]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate all possible parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 69:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 69. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a combination of operations and parentheses that evaluates to 69 using the numbers 1, 9, 4, 9, and 7 in the given order. The expression `(1+9-4)+(9*7)` achieves the desired result.\n\nNow, let's format the answer according to the specified format:\n\nThe expression `(1+9-4)+(9*7)` can be represented as a list of values and symbols: \n\n<<<[1, +, 9, -, 4, +, (, 9, *, 7, )]>>>"
