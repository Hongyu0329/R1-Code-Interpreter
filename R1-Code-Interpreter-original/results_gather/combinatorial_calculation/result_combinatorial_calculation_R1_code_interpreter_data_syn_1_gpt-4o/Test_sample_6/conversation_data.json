Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 6, and 4 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - 1 + 6 + 4 = 11\n   - 1 + 6 - 4 = 3\n   - 1 - 6 + 4 = -1\n   - 1 - 6 - 4 = -9\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**:\n   - 1 * 6 * 4 = 24\n   - 1 * 6 / 4 = 1.5\n   - 1 / 6 * 4 = 0.666...\n   - 1 / 6 / 4 = 0.0416...\n\n3. **Combination of Operations**:\n   - 1 + 6 * 4 = 25\n   - 1 * 6 + 4 = 10\n   - 1 * (6 + 4) = 10\n   - (1 + 6) * 4 = 28\n   - (1 + 6) / 4 = 1.75\n   - 1 + (6 / 4) = 2.5\n   - 1 * (6 - 4) = 2\n   - (1 * 6) - 4 = 2\n   - 1 - (6 / 4) = -0.5\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the expression `1 * (6 + 4)` results in 10. This uses each number exactly once and maintains the order of the numbers.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n```python\n# Calculation to verify the result\nresult = 1 * (6 + 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe correct expression is `1 * (6 + 4)`, which equals 10. Therefore, the list of values and symbols is:\n\n<<<[1, *, (, 6, +, 4, )]>>>",
    "The code execution confirms that the expression `1 * (6 + 4)` results in 10. Therefore, the correct list of values and symbols that achieve the target value of 10 is:\n\n<<<[1, *, (, 6, +, 4, )]>>>"
