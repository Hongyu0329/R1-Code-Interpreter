Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 2, and 1 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the precedence of operations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if we can achieve the target value of 10.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 2, 1]\ntarget = 10\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    # Without parentheses\n    expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr1) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    # With parentheses around first two numbers\n    expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr2) == target:\n        print(['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ')', ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    # With parentheses around last two numbers\n    expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr3) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')'])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination.",
    "The code output shows three different combinations of operations and parentheses that result in the target value of 10 using the numbers 7, 2, and 1 in the given order. \n\nThe combinations are:\n1. 7 + 2 + 1\n2. (7 + 2) + 1\n3. 7 + (2 + 1)\n\nAll these combinations correctly evaluate to 10. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, '+', 2, '+', 1]>>>"
