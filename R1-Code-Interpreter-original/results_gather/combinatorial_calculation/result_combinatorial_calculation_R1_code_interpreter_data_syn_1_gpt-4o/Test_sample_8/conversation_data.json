    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 7, and 6 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**: \n   - 9 + 7 + 6\n   - 9 + 7 - 6\n   - 9 - 7 + 6\n   - 9 - 7 - 6\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division**:\n   - 9 * 7 * 6\n   - 9 * 7 / 6\n   - 9 / 7 * 6\n   - 9 / 7 / 6\n\n3. **Combinations with Parentheses**:\n   - (9 + 7) + 6\n   - (9 + 7) - 6\n   - (9 - 7) + 6\n   - (9 - 7) - 6\n   - 9 + (7 + 6)\n   - 9 + (7 - 6)\n   - 9 - (7 + 6)\n   - 9 - (7 - 6)\n   - (9 * 7) * 6\n   - (9 * 7) / 6\n   - (9 / 7) * 6\n   - (9 / 7) / 6\n   - 9 * (7 * 6)\n   - 9 * (7 / 6)\n   - 9 / (7 * 6)\n   - 9 / (7 / 6)\n\nWe need to evaluate these expressions to see which one equals 10. Let's write a Python script to evaluate these expressions and find the correct one.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [9, 7, 6]\ntarget = 10\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible expressions with operations and parentheses\ndef generate_expressions(numbers, operations):\n    expressions = []\n    for ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n        # Without parentheses\n        expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n        expressions.append(expr1)\n        \n        # With parentheses\n        expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n        expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n        expressions.extend([expr2, expr3])\n    return expressions\n\n# Find the expression that evaluates to the target\nexpressions = generate_expressions(numbers, operations)\nfor expr in expressions:\n    if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n        print(expr)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct expression.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the expression `9 + 7 - 6` evaluates to 10, which is the target value. This expression uses the numbers 9, 7, and 6 in the given order and applies the operations of addition and subtraction to achieve the desired result.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[9, +, 7, -, 6]>>>"
