  "question": "Given 3 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 8, and 8 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the numbers directly.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nGiven the constraints, we need to explore different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 10.\n\nLet's write a Python script to evaluate all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find a valid expression.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [9, 8, 8]\ntarget = 10\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    # Generate expressions with different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n```\n\nThis script will evaluate all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that equals 10. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that the expression `9 + (8 / 8)` evaluates to 10. This is because `8 / 8` equals 1, and adding 9 results in 10. The expression `(9 + 8 / 8)` is equivalent to `9 + (8 / 8)` due to the order of operations, which also results in 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression using the numbers 9, 8, and 8 in that order, with arithmetic operations and parentheses, is:\n\n<<<[9, +, (, 8, /, 8, )]>>>"
