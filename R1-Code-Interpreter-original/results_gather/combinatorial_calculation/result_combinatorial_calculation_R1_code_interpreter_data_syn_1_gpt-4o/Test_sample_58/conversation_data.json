    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 5, and 9 in that order, result in the value 10. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and combinations:\n\n1. We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n2. We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n3. We need to ensure that each number is used exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by testing different combinations:\n\n- One possible approach is to use parentheses to change the order of operations, such as (5 + 5) * 9 or 5 + (5 * 9), and so on.\n\nLet's write a Python script to test these combinations and find a valid solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [5, 5, 9]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=2):\n    # Without parentheses\n    expr1 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr1) == 10:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    # With parentheses around first two numbers\n    expr2 = f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr2) == 10:\n        print(['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ')', ops[1], numbers[2]])\n    \n    # With parentheses around last two numbers\n    expr3 = f\"{numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr3) == 10:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')'])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with two valid solutions that achieve the target value of 10 using the numbers 5, 5, and 9 in the given order. The solutions are:\n\n1. Without parentheses: \\(5 / 5 + 9\\)\n2. With parentheses: \\((5 / 5) + 9\\)\n\nBoth expressions evaluate to 10. Therefore, the solutions are:\n\n<<<[5, '/', 5, '+', 9]>>> and <<<['(', 5, '/', 5, ')', '+', 9]>>>"
