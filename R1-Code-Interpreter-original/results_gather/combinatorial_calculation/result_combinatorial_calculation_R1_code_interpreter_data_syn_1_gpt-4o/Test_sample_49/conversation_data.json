    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the given numbers in the specified order, result in the target value of 100. The numbers given are 8, 9, 3, 1, 8, and 5.\n\nLet's break down the approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Brute Force Approach**:\n   - We can try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 100.\n   - Given the constraints, this is a feasible approach since the number of operations and parentheses combinations is limited.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - We will generate all possible combinations of operations and parentheses.\n   - Evaluate each expression to see if it equals 100.\n   - Return the first valid expression found.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [8, 9, 3, 1, 8, 5]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=5):\n    # Generate all possible parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})){ops[4]}{numbers[5]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}(({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}){ops[4]}{numbers[5]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}({numbers[4]}{ops[4]}{numbers[5]}))\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 100:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 100. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found an expression that evaluates to 100 using the given numbers and operations. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(8 \\times (9 + 3)) + (1 + 8 - 5)\n\\]\n\nThis expression uses the numbers in the given order and applies the operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 100.\n\nThe list of values and symbols for this expression is:\n\n<<<[8, *, (, 9, +, 3, ), +, (, 1, +, 8, -, 5, )]>>>"
