    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 3, and 3 in that order, result in the value 10. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's consider the possible operations:\n\n1. Addition: 9 + 3 + 3 = 15\n2. Subtraction: 9 - 3 - 3 = 3\n3. Multiplication: 9 * 3 * 3 = 81\n4. Division: 9 / 3 / 3 = 1\n\nNone of these simple operations result in 10. Therefore, we need to use a combination of operations and possibly parentheses to reach the target value.\n\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n- (9 + 3) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36\n- 9 + (3 * 3) = 9 + 9 = 18\n- (9 - 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18\n- 9 - (3 * 3) = 9 - 9 = 0\n- (9 / 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n- 9 / (3 + 3) = 9 / 6 = 1.5\n\nNone of these combinations result in 10. Let's try a different approach by using division and subtraction:\n\n- 9 - (3 / 3) = 9 - 1 = 8\n- (9 / 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nWe need to explore more combinations. Let's try using a combination of subtraction and addition:\n\n- 9 - 3 + 3 = 9 - 3 + 3 = 9\n- 9 + 3 - 3 = 9 + 3 - 3 = 9\n\nLet's try using division in a different way:\n\n- 9 / 3 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n- 9 / (3 / 3) = 9 / 1 = 9\n\nWe need to find a combination that results in 10. Let's try using parentheses and division:\n\n- (9 / 3) * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9\n- 9 / (3 / 3) = 9 / 1 = 9\n\nLet's try using a combination of subtraction and division:\n\n- 9 - (3 / 3) = 9 - 1 = 8\n\nWe need to find a combination that results in 10.
