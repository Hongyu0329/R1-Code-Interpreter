    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 2, 1, 6, 5, and 8 in that order, result in the value 78. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 2, 1, 6, 5, 8.\n2. We need to insert operations and possibly parentheses to achieve the result of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach with all possible combinations of operations and parentheses is feasible. We will use Python to automate this process.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and find the one that results in 78.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# The numbers in the given order\nnumbers = [2, 1, 6, 5, 8]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression with parentheses\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Try different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]} {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a combination of operations and parentheses that results in the target value of 78. The expression `((2 - 1) * 6) * (5 + 8)` evaluates to 78.\n\nNow, let's format the answer according to the required format, which is a list of values and symbols.\n\nThe expression `((2 - 1) * 6) * (5 + 8)` can be represented as:\n\n- Start with `(`, then `2`, `-`, `1`, `)`, `*`, `6`, `*`, `(`, `5`, `+`, `8`, `)`.\n\nSo, the formatted answer is:\n\n<<<[ (, 2, -, 1, ), *, 6, *, (, 5, +, 8, ) ]>>>"
