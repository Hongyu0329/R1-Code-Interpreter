  "question": "Given 5 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 78. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 9, 1, 1, and 1 in that order, result in the value 78. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 9, 1, 1, 1.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can insert any of the four arithmetic operations between the numbers.\n4. We can use parentheses to group operations.\n5. The result of the expression should be 78.\n\nGiven the constraints, we should consider the following:\n\n- Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction, so they will be evaluated first unless parentheses are used to change the order.\n- Since the target is 78, which is relatively large compared to the numbers we have, multiplication will likely play a significant role in reaching the target.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of operations and parentheses that satisfy these conditions. We can use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check if they result in 78.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# The numbers in the given order\nnumbers = [9, 9, 1, 1, 1]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression given as a list\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(''.join(map(str, expr)))\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        [numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4]],\n        ['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ')', ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4]],\n        [numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')', ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4]],\n        [numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], '(', numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ')', ops[3], numbers[4]],\n        [numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], '(', numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4], ')'],\n        ['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ')', ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4]],\n        [numbers[0], ops[0], '(', numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ')', ops[3], numbers[4]],\n        ['(', numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ')', ops[1], '(', numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ')', ops[3], numbers[4]],\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct combination of operations and parentheses.",
    "The code output provides three different expressions that evaluate to 78 using the numbers 9, 9, 1, 1, and 1 in the given order. Each expression uses arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value.\n\nThe expressions are:\n1. \\(9 \\times 9 - (1 + 1) - 1\\)\n2. \\(9 \\times 9 - 1 - (1 + 1)\\)\n3. \\(9 \\times 9 - 1 - 1 - 1\\)\n\nEach of these expressions correctly uses the numbers in the specified order and achieves the target value of 78.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, '*', 9, '-', 1, '-', 1, '-', 1]>>>"
