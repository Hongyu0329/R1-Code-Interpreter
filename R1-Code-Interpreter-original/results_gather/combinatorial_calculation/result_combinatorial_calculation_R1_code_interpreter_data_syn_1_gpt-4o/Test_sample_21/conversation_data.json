    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 7, 4, 1, and 6 in that order, result in the value 78. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 7, 4, 1, 6.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since the problem is complex and involves multiple operations, a brute-force approach with code can help us explore the possibilities efficiently.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find the correct expression that evaluates to 78.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 7, 4, 1, 6]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations and parentheses\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate possible expressions with parentheses\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]}) {ops[3]} {numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} {numbers[2]}) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} ({numbers[1]} {ops[1]} {numbers[2]})) {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} ({numbers[3]} {ops[3]} {numbers[4]}))\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]} {ops[0]} {numbers[1]}) {ops[1]} ({numbers[2]} {ops[2]} {numbers[3]})) {ops[3]} {numbers[4]}\",\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found an expression that evaluates to 78 using the given numbers and operations. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n((9 + 7) - (4 - 1)) \\times 6\n\\]\n\nThis expression uses each number exactly once and in the given order, with the appropriate arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 78.\n\nThe breakdown of the expression is as follows:\n1. Calculate \\(9 + 7 = 16\\).\n2. Calculate \\(4 - 1 = 3\\).\n3. Calculate \\(16 - 3 = 13\\).\n4. Finally, calculate \\(13 \\times 6 = 78\\).\n\nThus, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<<<[(9, +, 7), -, (4, -, 1), *, 6]>>>"
