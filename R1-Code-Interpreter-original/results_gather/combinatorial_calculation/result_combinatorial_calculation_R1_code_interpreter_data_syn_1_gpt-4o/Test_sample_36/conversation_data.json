  "question": "Given 5 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 69. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 9, 6, 5, 7, 7, the target values is: 69\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 6, 5, 7, and 7 in that order, result in the value 69. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to achieve this.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 6, 5, 7, 7.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to get the result of 69.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. We can use a brute-force approach to test all possible combinations of operations and parentheses.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 6, 5, 7, 7]\n\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Target value\ntarget = 69\n\n# Function to evaluate expression\ndef evaluate_expression(numbers, ops):\n    expression = f\"{numbers[0]}\"\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        expression += f\"{ops[i-1]}{numbers[i]}\"\n    try:\n        return eval(expression)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    if evaluate_expression(numbers, ops) == target:\n        print([numbers[0], ops[0], numbers[1], ops[1], numbers[2], ops[2], numbers[3], ops[3], numbers[4]])\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of the four operations between the five numbers and check if any combination results in 69. If it finds a valid combination, it will print it. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a combination of operations that results in the target value of 69. The combination is:\n\n\\[ 9 + 6 + 5 + 7 \\times 7 \\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n1. First, perform the multiplication: \\( 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\).\n2. Then, add the results: \\( 9 + 6 + 5 + 49 = 69 \\).\n\nThis confirms that the operations and numbers are correctly arranged to achieve the target value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, '+', 6, '+', 5, '+', 7, '*', 7]>>>"
