    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 3, 2, 9, and 8 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to achieve the target value.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Operations**: The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Generate Combinations**: We need to generate all possible combinations of these operations and parentheses between the numbers. Since there are 4 gaps between the 5 numbers, we have a lot of combinations to consider.\n\n3. **Evaluate Expressions**: For each combination, evaluate the expression to see if it equals 78.\n\n4. **Return the Correct Combination**: Once we find a combination that results in 78, we return it in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the numbers and target\nnumbers = [7, 3, 2, 9, 8]\ntarget = 78\n\n# Define possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate the expression without parentheses\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n        print(f\"Solution without parentheses: {expr}\")\n    \n    # Generate expressions with parentheses\n    # (a op b) op (c op d op e)\n    expr = f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n        print(f\"Solution with parentheses: {expr}\")\n    \n    # a op (b op (c op (d op e)))\n    expr = f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})))\"\n    if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n        print(f\"Solution with nested parentheses: {expr}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution that results in 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with three solutions that achieve the target value of 78 using the numbers 7, 3, 2, 9, and 8 in the given order. Let's format the solutions according to the required format:\n\n1. **Solution without parentheses**: 7 - 3 + 2 + 9 * 8\n2. **Solution with parentheses**: (7 - 3) + (2 + 9 * 8)\n3. **Solution with nested parentheses**: 7 - (3 - (2 + (9 * 8)))\n\nWe need to return one of these solutions in the specified format. Let's choose the first solution for simplicity.\n\n<<<[7, -, 3, +, 2, +, 9, *, 8]>>>"
