    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 9, 3, 3, and 7 in that order, result in the value 78. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 4, 9, 3, 3, 7.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to achieve the result of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, we can use a brute-force approach to test all possible combinations of operations and parentheses.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [4, 9, 3, 3, 7]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate all possible parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has found two expressions that evaluate to 78 using the given numbers in the specified order. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. `4 + (9 * (3 * 3)) - 7`: This expression uses addition, multiplication, and subtraction. The operations are applied as follows:\n   - Multiply 3 and 3 to get 9.\n   - Multiply the result by 9 to get 81.\n   - Add 4 to get 85.\n   - Subtract 7 to get 78.\n\n2. `(4 * 9) + (3 + 3) * 7`: This expression uses multiplication and addition. The operations are applied as follows:\n   - Multiply 4 and 9 to get 36.\n   - Add 3 and 3 to get 6.\n   - Multiply the result by 7 to get 42.\n   - Add the two results (36 and 42) to get 78.\n\nBoth expressions are valid solutions to the problem. Let's choose one of them to present as the final answer.\n\n<<<[4, +, (, 9, *, (, 3, *, 3, ), ), -, 7]>>>"
