    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 6, 6, 3, and 4 in that order, result in the value 78. The operations we can use are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 7, 6, 6, 3, 4.\n2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n3. We can insert operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 78.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Since this is a complex problem with many possible combinations, it is efficient to use a programmatic approach to explore the possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find a solution that results in 78.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [7, 6, 6, 3, 4]\n# Target value\ntarget = 78\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression\ndef evaluate_expression(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate expressions with different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]}))\",\n    ]\n    \n    # Evaluate each expression\n    for expr in expressions:\n        if evaluate_expression(expr) == target:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try different combinations of operations and parentheses to find an expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that the expression `(7*6)+(6+3)*4` evaluates to 78, which is the target value. This expression uses each of the numbers 7, 6, 6, 3, and 4 exactly once and in the given order, with the appropriate arithmetic operations and parentheses.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer according to the specified format:\n\n<<<[7, *, 6, +, (, 6, +, 3, ), *, 4]>>>"
