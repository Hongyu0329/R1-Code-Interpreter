    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 1, 7, 9, and 7 in that order, result in the value 78. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have the numbers: 9, 1, 7, 9, 7.\n2. We need to insert operations and parentheses to achieve the result of 78.\n3. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nTo find the solution, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach with all possible combinations of operations and parentheses is feasible. However, we need to ensure that the operations are valid (e.g., no division by zero).\n\nLet's write a Python script to try different combinations and find the correct one.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [9, 1, 7, 9, 7]\n# Possible operations\noperations = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    try:\n        return eval(expr)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None\n\n# Try all combinations of operations\nfor ops in product(operations, repeat=4):\n    # Generate expressions with different parenthesis placements\n    expressions = [\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"(({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}{numbers[1]}){ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"({numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]})){ops[2]}({numbers[3]}{ops[3]}{numbers[4]})\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}(({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}{numbers[2]}){ops[2]}{numbers[3]}){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\",\n        f\"{numbers[0]}{ops[0]}({numbers[1]}{ops[1]}({numbers[2]}{ops[2]}{numbers[3]})){ops[3]}{numbers[4]}\"\n    ]\n    \n    for expr in expressions:\n        if safe_eval(expr) == 78:\n            print(expr)\n            break\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible combinations of operations and parentheses and print the expression that evaluates to 78. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple valid expressions that evaluate to 78 using the given numbers and operations. Let's analyze these expressions:\n\n1. `((9-1)+7)+(9*7)`\n2. `(9-1)+(7*9)+7`\n3. `(9-(1-7))+(9*7)`\n4. `9-(1-(7*9))+7`\n\nEach of these expressions uses the numbers 9, 1, 7, 9, and 7 in the given order and applies arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 78.\n\nNow, let's choose one of these expressions and format it according to the required output format. I'll choose the first expression for simplicity.\n\nThe expression `((9-1)+7)+(9*7)` can be represented in the list format as:\n\n<<<[9, -, 1, +, 7, +, (, 9, *, 7, )]>>>"
