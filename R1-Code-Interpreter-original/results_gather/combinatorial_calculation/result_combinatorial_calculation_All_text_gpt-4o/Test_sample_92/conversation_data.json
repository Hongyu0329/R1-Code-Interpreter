    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the numbers 1, 8, 5, 2, and 3 to achieve a result of 78. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have the numbers 1, 8, 5, 2, and 3.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n   - The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n   - The target result is 78.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.\n   - Parentheses can alter the order of operations.\n\n3. **Trial and error with operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to group numbers for multiplication or addition.\n\n4. **Formulate a potential solution**:\n   - Try to maximize the result by using multiplication and addition strategically.\n   - Consider the impact of each operation on the sequence of numbers.\n\n5. **Calculate step by step**:\n   - Start with the sequence: 1, 8, 5, 2, 3.\n   - Try inserting operations and parentheses to reach 78.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use multiplication to increase the value significantly.\n- Use addition to reach the exact target.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n- Start with: 1 * (8 + 5) * 2 * 3\n- Calculate inside the parentheses first: 8 + 5 = 13\n- Then multiply: 1 * 13 = 13\n- Next, multiply by 2: 13 * 2 = 26\n- Finally, multiply by 3: 26 * 3 = 78\n\nThis sequence of operations results in the target value of 78.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[1, *, (, 8, +, 5, ), *, 2, *, 3]>>>"
