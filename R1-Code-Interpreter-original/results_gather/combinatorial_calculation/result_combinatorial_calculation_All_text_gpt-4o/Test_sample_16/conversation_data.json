    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 1, 3, and 2 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 5, 1, 3, and 2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Strategy**: \n   - Start by considering multiplication and division as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Use parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n- Add 1: \\(15 + 1 = 16\\).\n- Multiply by 2: \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\).\n\nThis does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\).\n- Add 3: \\(10 + 3 = 13\\).\n- Multiply by 1: \\(13 \\times 1 = 13\\).\n\nThis also does not give us 24. Let's try using division:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n- Add 1: \\(15 + 1 = 16\\).\n- Divide by 2: \\(16 / 2 = 8\\).\n\nThis does not work either. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(5 \\times (1 + 3) = 5 \\times 4 = 20\\).\n- Add 2: \\(20 + 2 = 22\\).\n\nThis is close but not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with addition: \\(5 + 1 = 6\\).\n- Multiply by 3: \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\).\n- Add 2: \\(18 + 2 = 20\\).\n\nThis is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with addition: \\(5 + 1 = 6\\).\n- Multiply by 2: \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\).\n- Multiply by 3: \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\).\n\nThis is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\).\n- Add 3: \\(10 + 3 = 13\\).\n- Multiply by 1: \\(13 \\times 1 = 13\\).\n\nThis is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n- Add 2: \\(15 + 2 = 17\\).\n- Multiply by 1: \\(17 \\times 1 = 17\\).\n\nThis is not 24.
