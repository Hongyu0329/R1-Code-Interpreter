    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 2, and 1 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 7, 2, and 1.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n   - The result must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 7 + 2 + 1 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 7 + 2 - 1 = 8\n     - 7 + 2 * 1 = 9\n     - 7 + 2 / 1 = 9\n     - 7 - 2 + 1 = 6\n     - 7 - 2 - 1 = 4\n     - 7 - 2 * 1 = 5\n     - 7 - 2 / 1 = 5\n     - 7 * 2 + 1 = 15\n     - 7 * 2 - 1 = 13\n     - 7 * 2 * 1 = 14\n     - 7 * 2 / 1 = 14\n     - 7 / 2 + 1 = 4.5\n     - 7 / 2 - 1 = 2.5\n     - 7 / 2 * 1 = 3.5\n     - 7 / 2 / 1 = 3.5\n\n3. **Consider using parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, but since we already found a simple solution without them, we don't need to explore this further.\n\n4. **Verify the solution**:\n   - The expression 7 + 2 + 1 = 10 satisfies all the constraints: it uses each number exactly once, in the given order, and results in the target value of 10.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<[7, +, 2, +, 1]>>>"
