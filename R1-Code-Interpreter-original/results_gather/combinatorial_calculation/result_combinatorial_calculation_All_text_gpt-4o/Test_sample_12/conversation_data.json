  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a way to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the numbers 7, 6, 1, and 2 to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 7, 6, 1, and 2 in that order. We need to use each number exactly once and only once.\n\n2. **Operations Available**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n3. **Target**: The target value is 24.\n\n4. **Strategy**: \n   - We need to consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS rules).\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and use parentheses to adjust the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to group operations and change the precedence.\n\n6. **Possible Combinations**:\n   - Try using multiplication first, as it can help reach larger numbers quickly.\n   - Consider the effect of each operation on the sequence of numbers.\n\n7. **Solution**:\n   - One possible solution is to use the operations and parentheses as follows:\n     - First, multiply 6 and 2 to get 12.\n     - Then, add 1 to get 13.\n     - Finally, multiply by 7 to reach 91, which is incorrect.\n   - Re-evaluate and try another approach:\n     - Multiply 7 and 2 to get 14.\n     - Add 6 to get 20.\n     - Add 1 to get 21, which is incorrect.\n   - Re-evaluate and try another approach:\n     - Multiply 6 and 2 to get 12.\n     - Multiply 12 by 1 to get 12.\n     - Add 7 to get 19, which is incorrect.\n   - Re-evaluate and try another approach:\n     - Multiply 7 and 6 to get 42.\n     - Subtract 1 to get 41.\n     - Divide by 2 to get 20.5, which is incorrect.\n   - Re-evaluate and try another approach:\n     - Multiply 7 and 2 to get 14.\n     - Multiply 14 by 1 to get 14.\n     - Add 6 to get 20, which is incorrect.\n   - Re-evaluate and try another approach:\n     - Multiply 7 and 6 to get 42.\n     - Subtract 2 to get 40.\n     - Subtract 1 to get 39, which is incorrect.\n   - Re-evaluate and try another approach:\n     - Multiply 7 and 6 to get 42.\n     - Divide by 2 to get 21.\n     -
