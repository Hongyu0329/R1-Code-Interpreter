    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 3, 2, 9, and 8 in that order, result in the value 78. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 7, 3, 2, 9, and 8.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The final result of the expression must be 78.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**:\n   - Addition and multiplication increase the value.\n   - Subtraction and division decrease the value.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, which is crucial for achieving the target value.\n\n3. **Initial Attempts**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to increase the value to 78.\n   - Try to group numbers using parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Begin by testing combinations of operations and parentheses to see which might yield 78.\n   - Consider the impact of each operation and how it affects the total.\n\n5. **Solution**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n     - Use multiplication to increase the value significantly.\n     - Use addition to adjust the total to reach exactly 78.\n\n6. **Final Expression**:\n   - The expression that works is: \\((7 + 3) \\times (2 + 9) + 8\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(7 + 3 = 10\\)\n     - \\(2 + 9 = 11\\)\n     - \\(10 \\times 11 = 110\\)\n     - \\(110 + 8 = 118\\)\n\n   - However, this does not yield 78, so let's try another approach:\n     - \\((7 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 9) + 8\\)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\)\n       - \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n       - \\(21 + 18 = 39\\)\n       - \\(39 + 8 = 47\\)\n\n   -

\\(21 \\times 11 = 231\\)\n       - \\(231 - 8 = 223\\)\n\n   - This still does not yield 78, so let's try another approach:\n     - \\((7 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 9) + 8\\)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       -
