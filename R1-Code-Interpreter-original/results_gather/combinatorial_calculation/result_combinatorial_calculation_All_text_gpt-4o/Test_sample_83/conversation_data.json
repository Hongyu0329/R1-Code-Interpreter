  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 6, 7, 8, 3, the target values is: 24\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 7, 8, and 3 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 6, 7, 8, and 3. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start by considering the basic operations between the numbers.\n   - Try different combinations of operations and use parentheses to change the order of operations if necessary.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Let's try using multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher values like 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( (6 \\times (7 - 8 + 3)) \\)\n     - Calculate inside the parentheses first: \\( 7 - 8 + 3 = 2 \\)\n     - Then multiply: \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) (This does not work)\n   - Try another combination: \\( 6 \\times 3 + 7 - 8 \\)\n     - Calculate: \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\)\n     - Then add: \\( 18 + 7 = 25 \\)\n     - Subtract: \\( 25 - 8 = 17 \\) (This does not work)\n   - Try another combination: \\( 6 \\times (7 - (8 - 3)) \\)\n     - Calculate inside the innermost parentheses first: \\( 8 - 3 = 5 \\)\n     - Then calculate: \\( 7 - 5 = 2 \\)\n     - Finally multiply: \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) (This does not work)\n   - Try another combination: \\( (6 \\times 3) + (7 - 8) \\)\n     - Calculate: \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\)\n     - Then calculate: \\( 7 - 8 = -1 \\)\n     - Finally add: \\( 18 + (-1) = 17 \\) (This does not work)\n   - Try another combination: \\( (6 \\times 3) + 7 - 8 \\)\n     - Calculate: \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\)\n     - Then add: \\( 18 + 7 = 25 \\)\n     -
