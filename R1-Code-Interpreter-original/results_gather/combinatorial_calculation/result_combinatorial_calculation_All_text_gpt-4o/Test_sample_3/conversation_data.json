    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 2, and 4 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 5, 2, and 4.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n   - The result must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by trying simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 (not 10)\n     - 5 + 2 - 4 = 3 (not 10)\n     - 5 + 2 * 4 = 13 (not 10)\n     - 5 + 2 / 4 = 5.5 (not 10)\n     - 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 (not 10)\n     - 5 - 2 - 4 = -1 (not 10)\n     - 5 - 2 * 4 = -3 (not 10)\n     - 5 - 2 / 4 = 4.5 (not 10)\n     - 5 * 2 + 4 = 14 (not 10)\n     - 5 * 2 - 4 = 6 (not 10)\n     - 5 * 2 * 4 = 40 (not 10)\n     - 5 * 2 / 4 = 2.5 (not 10)\n     - 5 / 2 + 4 = 6.5 (not 10)\n     - 5 / 2 - 4 = -1.5 (not 10)\n     - 5 / 2 * 4 = 10 (this works!)\n     - 5 / 2 / 4 = 0.625 (not 10)\n\n3. **Verify the correct operation**:\n   - The operation 5 / 2 * 4 results in 10.\n   - Calculation: \n     - First, divide 5 by 2 to get 2.5.\n     - Then, multiply 2.5 by 4 to get 10.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The correct sequence of operations is 5 / 2 * 4, which equals 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[5, /, 2, *, 4]>>>"
