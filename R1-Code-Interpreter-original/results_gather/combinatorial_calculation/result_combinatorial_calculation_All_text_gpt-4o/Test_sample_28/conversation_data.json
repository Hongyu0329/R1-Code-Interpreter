    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the given numbers (9, 1, 7, 9, 7) to achieve the target value of 78. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 9, 1, 7, 9, 7.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n   - The result must be exactly 78.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively small, so multiplication might be necessary to reach 78.\n   - Division might be less useful since it reduces the value, but it could be used to adjust intermediate results.\n   - Parentheses can help in grouping operations to achieve the desired result.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Construction**:\n   - Start with the first two numbers: 9 and 1. Multiplying them gives 9, which is not helpful. Adding them gives 10.\n   - Next, consider the third number, 7. Multiplying 10 by 7 gives 70.\n   - Now, consider the fourth number, 9. Adding 9 to 70 gives 79, which is close to 78.\n   - Finally, consider the last number, 7. Subtracting 1 from 79 gives 78.\n\n5. **Construct the Expression**:\n   - The expression that fits the above logic is: (9 + 1) * 7 + 9 - 1 = 78.\n\n6. **Verify the Expression**:\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 9 + 1 = 10\n     - 10 * 7 = 70\n     - 70 + 9 = 79\n     - 79 - 1 = 78\n\nThe expression satisfies all the constraints and achieves the target value.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<[(9, +, 1), *, 7, +, 9, -, 1]>>>"
