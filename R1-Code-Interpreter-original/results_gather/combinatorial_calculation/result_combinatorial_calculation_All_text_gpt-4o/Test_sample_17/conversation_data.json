    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 7, 1, and 3 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 3, 7, 1, and 3. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to alter the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication and addition:\n  - \\(3 \\times (7 + 1 + 3)\\)\n  - Calculate inside the parentheses first: \\(7 + 1 + 3 = 11\\)\n  - Then multiply: \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\) (not 24)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - \\((3 + 7) \\times (1 + 3)\\)\n  - Calculate inside the parentheses: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\) and \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n  - Then multiply: \\(10 \\times 4 = 40\\) (not 24)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - \\(3 \\times 7 + 1 + 3\\)\n  - Calculate: \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n  - Then add: \\(21 + 1 + 3 = 25\\) (not 24)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - \\(3 \\times (7 + 1) + 3\\)\n  - Calculate inside the parentheses: \\(7 + 1 = 8\\)\n  - Then multiply: \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n  - Finally add: \\(24 + 3 = 27\\) (not 24)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - \\((3 + 7) \\times 1 + 3\\)\n  - Calculate inside the parentheses: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\)\n  - Then multiply: \\(10 \\times 1 = 10\\)\n  - Finally add: \\(10 + 3 = 13\\) (not 24)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - \\(3 \\times 7 - 1 + 3\\)\n  - Calculate: \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n  - Then subtract: \\(21 - 1 = 20\\)\n  - Finally add: \\(20 + 3 = 23\\) (not 24)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - \\(3 \\times (7 - 1) + 3\\)\n  - Calculate inside the parentheses: \\(7 - 1 = 6\\)\n  - Then multiply: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n  - Finally add: \\(18 + 3 = 21\\) (not 24)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - \\((3 \\times 7) + (1 \\times 3)\\)\n  - Calculate: \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) and \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n  - Then add: \\(21 + 3 = 24\\) (this works!)\n\nThe correct expression is \\((3 \\times 7) + (1 \\times 3)\\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<[3, *, 7, +, 1, *, 3]>>>"
