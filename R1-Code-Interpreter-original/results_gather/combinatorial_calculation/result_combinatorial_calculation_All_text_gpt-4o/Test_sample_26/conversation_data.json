    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the given numbers (9, 8, 8, 1, 5) to achieve the target value of 78. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 9, 8, 8, 1, 5.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n   - The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n   - We need to achieve a result of 78.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Since the target is relatively large (78), multiplication might be necessary to reach such a high number.\n   - Division might not be very useful here because it typically reduces the result, and we need to increase it.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, which might be crucial.\n\n3. **Trial and error with operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Try to use addition and subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 78.\n\n4. **Step-by-step calculation**:\n   - Consider the expression: \\(9 \\times 8 + 8 \\times 1 + 5\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(9 \\times 8 = 72\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\)\n     - \\(72 + 8 = 80\\)\n     - \\(80 - 5 = 75\\) (This is incorrect, so adjust the operations)\n   - Adjust the operations to: \\(9 \\times 8 + 8 + 1 \\times 5\\).\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - \\(9 \\times 8 = 72\\)\n     - \\(72 + 8 = 80\\)\n     - \\(80 + 1 = 81\\)\n     - \\(81 - 5 = 76\\) (This is incorrect, so adjust the operations)\n   - Adjust the operations to: \\(9 \\times 8 + 8 + 1 \\times 5\\).\n   -
