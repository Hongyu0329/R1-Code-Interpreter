    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 7, and 6 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 9, 7, and 6.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n   - We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**:\n   - Start with basic operations without parentheses:\n     - 9 + 7 + 6 = 22\n     - 9 + 7 - 6 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 9 + 7 * 6 = 51\n     - 9 + 7 / 6 = 10.1667 (not an integer)\n     - 9 - 7 + 6 = 8\n     - 9 - 7 - 6 = -4\n     - 9 - 7 * 6 = -33\n     - 9 - 7 / 6 = 7.8333 (not an integer)\n     - 9 * 7 + 6 = 69\n     - 9 * 7 - 6 = 57\n     - 9 * 7 * 6 = 378\n     - 9 * 7 / 6 = 10.5 (not an integer)\n     - 9 / 7 + 6 = 7.2857 (not an integer)\n     - 9 / 7 - 6 = -4.7143 (not an integer)\n     - 9 / 7 * 6 = 7.7143 (not an integer)\n     - 9 / 7 / 6 = 0.2143 (not an integer)\n\n   - Now, consider using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n     - (9 + 7) + 6 = 22\n     - (9 + 7) - 6 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - (9 + 7) * 6 = 96\n     - (9 + 7) / 6 = 2.6667 (not an integer)\n     - (9 - 7) + 6 = 8\n     - (9 - 7) - 6 = -4\n     - (9 - 7) * 6 = 12\n     - (9 - 7) / 6 = 0.3333 (not an integer)\n     - (9 * 7) + 6 = 69\n     - (9 * 7) - 6 = 57\n     - (9 * 7) * 6 = 378\n     - (9 * 7) / 6 = 10.5 (not an integer)\n     - (9 / 7) + 6 = 7.2857 (not an integer)\n     - (9 / 7) - 6 = -4.7143 (not an integer)\n     - (9 / 7) * 6 = 7.7143 (not an integer)\n     - (9 / 7) / 6 = 0.2143 (not an integer)\n\n4. **Identify the correct solution**:\n   - From the above calculations, the expression that results in 10 is:\n     - 9 + 7 - 6 = 10\n     - (9 + 7) - 6 = 10\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   - The correct expression using the format specified is:\n     - <<<[9, +, 7, -, 6]>>>\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[9, +, 7, -, 6]>>>"
