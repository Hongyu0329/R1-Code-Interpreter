    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 5, 2, and 2 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 6, 5, 2, and 2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n- Subtract the first 2: \\(30 - 2 = 28\\).\n- Subtract the second 2: \\(28 - 2 = 26\\).\n\nThis does not give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses to change the order of operations:\n  - Calculate \\(5 - 2 = 3\\).\n  - Multiply the result by 2: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n  - Add 6: \\(6 + 6 = 12\\).\n\nThis still does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - Calculate \\(6 \\times (5 - 2) = 6 \\times 3 = 18\\).\n  - Add the remaining 2: \\(18 + 2 = 20\\).\n\nThis still does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division:\n  - Calculate \\(6 \\div (5 - 2) = 6 \\div 3 = 2\\).\n  - Multiply by the remaining 2: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n  - Add the remaining 5: \\(4 + 5 = 9\\).\n\nThis still does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition:\n  - Calculate \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n  - Subtract the first 2: \\(30 - 2 = 28\\).\n  - Subtract the second 2: \\(28 - 2 = 26\\).\n\nThis still does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses and multiplication:\n  - Calculate \\((6 \\times 5) - (2 \\times 2) = 30 - 4 = 26\\).\n\nThis still does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses and division:\n  - Calculate \\((6 \\times 5) - (2 + 2) = 30 - 4 = 26\\).\n\nThis still does not give us 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses and division:\n  - Calculate \\((6 \\times 5) - (2 \\div 2) = 30 - 1 = 29\\).\n\nThis still does not give us 24.
