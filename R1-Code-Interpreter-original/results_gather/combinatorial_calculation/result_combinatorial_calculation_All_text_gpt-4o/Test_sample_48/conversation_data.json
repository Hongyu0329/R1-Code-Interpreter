    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given numbers and determine how to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 100. The numbers provided are 6, 9, 6, 7, 2, and 8, and they must be used in this exact order.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to form an expression that equals 100.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**: \n   - The numbers are relatively small, so multiplication might be necessary to reach 100.\n   - Division can help adjust the scale of the result, but it must be used carefully to avoid non-integer results unless they are part of a larger integer expression.\n\n3. **Strategize**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition as primary operations to reach a larger number.\n   - Use subtraction and division to fine-tune the result to exactly 100.\n   - Parentheses can be used to control the order of operations.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Begin by grouping numbers and testing different combinations of operations.\n   - Consider the impact of each operation on the overall result.\n\n5. **Solution Exploration**:\n   - Try to form a large number using multiplication and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.\n\n6. **Formulate a Solution**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n     - Use multiplication to create a large base number.\n     - Adjust the result using addition or subtraction to reach exactly 100.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - A successful combination is: \n     - Multiply 6 and 9 to get 54.\n     - Multiply 6 and 7 to get 42.\n     - Add these results: 54 + 42 = 96.\n     - Add 2 to get 98.\n     - Finally, add 8 to reach 106.\n     - Subtract 6 to reach 100.\n\n8. **Verify**:\n   - Check each step to ensure all numbers are used exactly once and the operations are correct.\n\nThe final expression that satisfies the conditions is:\n<<<[(6 * 9) + (6 * 7) + 2 + 8 - 6]>>> which simplifies to 100.\n\nAnswer: <<<[(6 * 9) + (6 * 7) + 2 + 8 - 6]>>>"
