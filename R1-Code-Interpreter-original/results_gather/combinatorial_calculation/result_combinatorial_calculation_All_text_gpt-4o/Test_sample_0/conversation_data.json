    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 6, 2, and 7 in that order, results in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 6, 2, and 7. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 6 + 2 + 7 = 15\n     - 6 + 2 - 7 = 1\n     - 6 - 2 + 7 = 11\n     - 6 - 2 - 7 = -3\n   - **Multiplication**:\n     - 6 * 2 * 7 = 84\n     - 6 * 2 + 7 = 19\n     - 6 + 2 * 7 = 20\n     - 6 * 2 - 7 = 5\n     - 6 - 2 * 7 = -8\n   - **Division**:\n     - 6 / 2 + 7 = 10\n     - 6 + 2 / 7 ≈ 6.2857\n     - 6 / 2 - 7 = -4\n     - 6 - 2 / 7 ≈ 5.7143\n     - 6 / 2 * 7 = 21\n     - 6 * 2 / 7 ≈ 1.7143\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations:\n     - (6 + 2) * 7 = 56\n     - (6 - 2) * 7 = 28\n     - 6 * (2 + 7) = 54\n     - 6 * (2 - 7) = -30\n     - (6 + 2) / 7 ≈ 1.1429\n     - (6 - 2) / 7 ≈ 0.5714\n     - 6 / (2 + 7) = 0.6667\n     - 6 / (2 - 7) = -1.2\n\n4. **Finding the Correct Combination**:\n   - From the above calculations, the combination that results in 10 is:\n     - 6 / 2 + 7 = 10\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of operations and parentheses that results in the target value of 10 is:\n\n<<<[6, /, 2, +, 7]>>>"
