    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 3, 9, and 3 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 2, 3, 9, and 3. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try the following expression:\n\n- Use multiplication and addition: \\((2 \\times 9) + (3 \\times 3)\\)\n\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n   - Add the results: \\(18 + 9 = 27\\) (This is not 24, so we need to try another approach.)\n\n- Try another combination: \\((2 + 3) \\times (9 - 3)\\)\n\n   - Calculate \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n   - Calculate \\(9 - 3 = 6\\)\n   - Multiply the results: \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\) (This is not 24, so we need to try another approach.)\n\n- Try another combination: \\((2 \\times 3) + (9 - 3)\\)\n\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n   - Calculate \\(9 - 3 = 6\\)\n   - Add the results: \\(6 + 6 = 12\\) (This is not 24, so we need to try another approach.)\n\n- Try another combination: \\((2 + 3) \\times 3 + 9\\)\n\n   - Calculate \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)\n   - Add 9: \\(15 + 9 = 24\\) (This is the correct result.)\n\nThe correct expression is \\((2 + 3) \\times 3 + 9\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[(2, +, 3), *, 3, +, 9]>>>"
