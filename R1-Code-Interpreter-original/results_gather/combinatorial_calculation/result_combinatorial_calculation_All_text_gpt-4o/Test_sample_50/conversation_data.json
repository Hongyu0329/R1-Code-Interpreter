    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 3, 2, and 9 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 3, 2, and 9.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n   - The result must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 3 + 2 + 9 = 14\n     - 3 + 2 - 9 = -4\n     - 3 + 2 * 9 = 21\n     - 3 + 2 / 9 ≈ 3.22\n     - 3 - 2 + 9 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 3 - 2 - 9 = -8\n     - 3 - 2 * 9 = -15\n     - 3 - 2 / 9 ≈ 2.78\n     - 3 * 2 + 9 = 15\n     - 3 * 2 - 9 = -3\n     - 3 * 2 * 9 = 54\n     - 3 * 2 / 9 = 0.67\n     - 3 / 2 + 9 = 10.5\n     - 3 / 2 - 9 = -7.5\n     - 3 / 2 * 9 = 13.5\n     - 3 / 2 / 9 ≈ 0.17\n\n3. **Consider using parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, so let's explore:\n     - (3 + 2) + 9 = 14\n     - (3 + 2) - 9 = -4\n     - (3 + 2) * 9 = 45\n     - (3 + 2) / 9 ≈ 0.56\n     - 3 + (2 + 9) = 14\n     - 3 + (2 - 9) = -4\n     - 3 + (2 * 9) = 21\n     - 3 + (2 / 9) ≈ 3.22\n     - 3 - (2 + 9) = -8\n     - 3 - (2 - 9) = 10 (This is another potential solution)\n     - 3 - (2 * 9) = -15\n     - 3 - (2 / 9) ≈ 2.78\n     - 3 * (2 + 9) = 33\n     - 3 * (2 - 9) = -21\n     - 3 * (2 * 9) = 54\n     - 3 * (2 / 9) ≈ 0.67\n     - 3 / (2 + 9) ≈ 0.27\n     - 3 / (2 - 9) ≈ -0.43\n     - 3 / (2 * 9) ≈ 0.17\n     - (3 - 2) + 9 = 10 (This is another potential solution)\n     - (3 - 2) - 9 = -8\n     - (3 - 2) * 9 = 9\n     - (3 - 2) / 9 ≈ 0.11\n\n4. **Identify valid solutions**:\n   - From the analysis, we have found three valid solutions that result in 10:\n     - 3 - 2 + 9 = 10\n     - 3 - (2 - 9) = 10\n     - (3 - 2) + 9 = 10\n\n5. **Choose one solution**:\n   - Let's choose the simplest solution without parentheses: 3 - 2 + 9 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[3, -, 2, +, 9]>>>"
