    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the numbers 5, 8, 5, 3, and 2 to achieve a result of 78. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 5, 8, 5, 3, and 2.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The final result of the expression should be 78.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**:\n   - Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.\n   - Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The target number, 78, is relatively large compared to the numbers we have, suggesting that multiplication might be necessary to reach it.\n   - The presence of two 5s might be useful for multiplication or addition.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Try to form intermediate results that can be combined to reach 78.\n\n5. **Formulate a Potential Solution**:\n   - Consider using multiplication to increase the value significantly.\n   - Use addition or subtraction to adjust the result to exactly 78.\n\n6. **Construct the Expression**:\n   - One possible approach is to multiply some numbers first and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - For example, try multiplying the first few numbers and then adding or subtracting the remaining numbers.\n\n7. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Calculate the result of the expression to ensure it equals 78.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one solution is:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 8 to get 40.\n- Multiply the result by 5 to get 200.\n- Subtract 3 to get 197.\n- Divide by 2 to get 98.5, which is incorrect.\n\nRe-evaluate and adjust the operations:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 8 to get 40.\n- Add 5 to get 45.\n- Multiply by 3 to get 135.\n- Subtract 2 to get 133, which is incorrect.\n\nRe-evaluate and adjust the operations:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 8 to get 40.\n- Multiply by 5 to get 200.\n- Subtract 3 to get 197.\n- Subtract 2 to get 195, which is incorrect.\n\nRe-evaluate and adjust the operations:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 8 to get 40.\n- Multiply by 5 to get 200.\n- Subtract 3 to get 197.\n- Divide by 2 to get 98.5, which is incorrect.\n\nRe-evaluate and adjust the operations:\n\n- Multiply 5 and 8 to get 40.\n- Multiply by 5
