  "question": "Given 3 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 7, and 2 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 1, 7, and 2.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - The numbers must remain in the given order: 1, 7, 2.\n   - We need to achieve a result of 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 1 + 7 + 2 = 10. This is a straightforward solution that meets the requirement.\n\n3. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Check if the solution uses each number exactly once: Yes, it uses 1, 7, and 2.\n   - Check if the solution results in 10: Yes, 1 + 7 + 2 = 10.\n\n4. **Consider other combinations**:\n   - Although we found a solution, let's briefly consider if other combinations might work:\n     - 1 + 7 - 2 = 6 (not 10)\n     - 1 * 7 + 2 = 9 (not 10)\n     - 1 + 7 * 2 = 15 (not 10)\n     - 1 * 7 * 2 = 14 (not 10)\n     - 1 * (7 + 2) = 9 (not 10)\n     - (1 + 7) * 2 = 16 (not 10)\n     - 1 + (7 * 2) = 15 (not 10)\n     - (1 + 7) + 2 = 10 (same as 1 + 7 + 2)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only combination that results in 10 is 1 + 7 + 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[1, +, 7, +, 2]>>>."
