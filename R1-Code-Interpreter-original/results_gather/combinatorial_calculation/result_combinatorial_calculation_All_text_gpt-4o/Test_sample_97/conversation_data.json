    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (9, 9, 1, 1, 1) to achieve the target value of 78. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 9, 9, 1, 1, 1.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The final result of the expression must be 78.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**:\n   - Since the target number is relatively large (78), multiplication will likely play a key role in reaching this number.\n   - Division might not be very useful here because it tends to reduce the value, and we need to increase it to reach 78.\n   - Addition and subtraction can be used to adjust the total, but they are less impactful than multiplication for reaching a large number.\n\n3. **Strategize the Use of Parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, which is crucial in reaching the target number.\n   - We should consider grouping numbers in a way that allows multiplication to have a significant impact.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Logical Reasoning**:\n   - Start by considering how to use multiplication effectively. The largest numbers are 9 and 9, so multiplying them could be a good start.\n   - Consider the expression: (9 * 9) + (1 * 1 * 1). This results in 81, which is close to 78 but slightly over.\n   - Adjust the expression to reduce the total by using subtraction: (9 * 9) - (1 + 1 + 1). This results in 81 - 3 = 78.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Check that all numbers are used exactly once: 9, 9, 1, 1, 1.\n   - Ensure the operations and parentheses are correctly applied to achieve the target value.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct expression:\n\n<<<[9, *, 9, -, (, 1, +, 1, +, 1, )]>>>"
