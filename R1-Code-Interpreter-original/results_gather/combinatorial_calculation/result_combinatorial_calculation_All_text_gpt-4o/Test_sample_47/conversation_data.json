    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5) to achieve a result of 100. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have six numbers: 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n   - The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once.\n   - The result must be 100.\n\n2. **Consider Possible Operations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which combination results in 100.\n   - Since multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction, we need to be careful with the placement of parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n3. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Start by considering the impact of multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the value.\n   - Use parentheses to group operations and control the order of evaluation.\n\n4. **Formulate a Solution**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n     - Use multiplication to increase the value significantly.\n     - Use addition and subtraction to adjust the total to exactly 100.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Calculate the result of the chosen operations to ensure it equals 100.\n\nAfter testing different combinations, one solution is:\n\n<<<[(7 + 4) * 5 + 5 + 5 + 5]>>>\n\nThis evaluates as follows:\n- (7 + 4) = 11\n- 11 * 5 = 55\n- 55 + 5 = 60\n- 60 + 5 = 65\n- 65 + 5 = 70\n- 70 + 5 = 75\n\nThis does not reach 100, so let's try another approach:\n\n<<<[(7 * 4) + (5 * 5) + 5 + 5]>>>\n\nThis evaluates as follows:\n- 7 * 4 = 28\n- 5 * 5 = 25\n- 28 + 25 = 53\n- 53 + 5 = 58\n- 58 + 5 = 63\n- 63 + 5 = 68\n\nThis also does not reach 100.
