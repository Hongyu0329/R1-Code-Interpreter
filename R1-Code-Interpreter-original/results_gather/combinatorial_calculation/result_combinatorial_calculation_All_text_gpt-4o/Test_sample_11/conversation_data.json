    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 9, 6, 4, and 6 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 9, 6, 4, and 6. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start by considering the possible operations between the numbers.\n   - Try different combinations of operations and use parentheses to change the order of operations if necessary.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Let's try using multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to reach higher numbers like 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( (9 - 6) \\times (4 + 6) \\).\n\n6. **Calculation**:\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n     - \\( 9 - 6 = 3 \\)\n     - \\( 4 + 6 = 10 \\)\n   - Now multiply the results:\n     - \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\)\n\n7. **Adjustments**:\n   - The result is 30, which is too high. We need to adjust the operations.\n   - Consider using division to reduce the result.\n\n8. **Re-evaluation**:\n   - Try the expression: \\( 9 \\times (6 - \\frac{4}{6}) \\).\n\n9. **Calculation**:\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n     - \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n     - \\( 6 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{16}{3} \\)\n   - Now multiply:\n     - \\( 9 \\times \\frac{16}{3} = 48 \\)\n\n10. **Final Adjustment**:\n    - The result is still not 24. Let's try another approach.\n    - Consider: \\( (9 - 6) \\times 4 + 6 \\).\n\n11. **Calculation**:\n    - Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n      - \\( 9 - 6 = 3 \\)\n    - Multiply:\n      - \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\n    - Add:\n      - \\( 12 + 6 = 18 \\)\n\n12. **Re-evaluation**:\n    - The result is 18, which is still not 24. Let's try another approach.\n    - Consider: \\( 9 + 6 + 4 + 6 \\).\n\n13. **Calculation**:\n    - Add all numbers:\n      - \\( 9 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 25 \\)\n\n14. **Final Adjustment**:\n    - The result is 25, which is close but not 24. Let's try another approach.\n    - Consider: \\( 9 \\times (6 - (4 - 6)) \\).\n\n15. **Calculation**:\n    - Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n      - \\( 4 - 6 = -2 \\)\n      - \\( 6 - (-2) = 8 \\)\n    - Multiply:\n      - \\( 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\)\n\n16. **Re-evaluation**:\n    - The result is 72, which is too high. Let's try another approach.\n    - Consider: \\( (9 \\times 6) / (4 - 6) \\).\n\n17. **Calculation**:\n    - Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n      - \\( 4 - 6 = -2 \\)\n    - Multiply:\n      - \\( 9 \\times 6 = 54 \\)\n    - Divide:\n      - \\( 54 / -2 = -27 \\)\n\n18. **Final Adjustment**:\n    - The result is -27, which is incorrect. Let's try another approach.\n    - Consider: \\( (9 \\times 4) - (6 + 6) \\).\n\n19. **Calculation**:\n    - Multiply:\n      - \\( 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\)\n    - Add:\n      - \\( 6 + 6 = 12 \\)\n    - Subtract:\n      - \\( 36 - 12 = 24 \\)\n\n20. **Conclusion**:\n    - The expression \\( (9 \\times 4) - (6 + 6) \\) evaluates to 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[9, *, 4, -, (, 6, +, 6, )]>>>"
