    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (7, 8, 2, 4, 4) to achieve the target value of 69. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 7, 8, 2, 4, 4.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 69.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The target number, 69, is relatively large compared to the numbers we have, so multiplication might be necessary to reach it.\n   - Division might be used to adjust the result, but it should be used carefully to avoid non-integer results unless they are part of a larger integer calculation.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition as primary operations to increase the value.\n   - Use parentheses to control the order of operations and group numbers effectively.\n\n4. **Formulate Possible Expressions**:\n   - Consider the sequence and try different combinations of operations:\n     - One possible approach is to multiply some numbers to get a larger base and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n     - Use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n     - Use multiplication to increase the value significantly.\n     - Adjust the result with addition or subtraction to reach exactly 69.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - By testing different combinations, we find that the following expression works:\n     - \\((7 + 8) \\times 4 + 2 + 4\\)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - \\(7 + 8 = 15\\)\n       - \\(15 \\times 4 = 60\\)\n       - \\(60 + 2 = 62\\)\n       - \\(62 + 4 = 66\\)\n     - This does not reach 69, so we need to adjust the operations.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate and Adjust**:\n   - After further adjustments, the correct expression is:\n     - \\((7 \\times 8) + (2 \\times 4) + 4\\)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n       - \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n       - \\(56 + 8 = 64\\)\n       - \\(64 + 4 = 68\\)\n     - This still does not reach 69, so further adjustments are needed.\n\n8. **Final Correct Expression**:\n   - The correct expression that evaluates to 69 is:\n     - \\((7 \\times 8) + 2 + 4 + 4\\)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n       - \\(56 + 2 = 58\\)\n       - \\(58 + 4 = 62\\)\n       - \\(62 + 4 = 66\\)\n     - This still does not reach 69, indicating a need for a different approach.\n\n9. **Correct Approach**:\n   - After further trials, the correct expression is:\n     - \\((7 \\times 8) + (4 \\times 2) + 4\\)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n       - \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n       - \\(56 + 8 = 64\\)\n       - \\(64 + 4 = 68\\)\n     - This still does not reach 69, indicating a need for a different approach.\n\n10. **Final Correct Expression**:\n    - The correct expression that evaluates to 69 is:\n      -
