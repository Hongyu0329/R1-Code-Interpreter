  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the given numbers 5, 5, 3, and 6 in the specified order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 5, 5, 3, and 6. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease values.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: \n  - Expression: \\( (5 + 5) \\times (3 - 6) \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( (10) \\times (-3) = -30 \\) (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 2**:\n  - Expression: \\( 5 \\times (5 + 3) - 6 \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( 5 \\times 8 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34 \\) (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 3**:\n  - Expression: \\( 5 \\times 5 - (3 + 6) \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( 25 - 9 = 16 \\) (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 4**:\n  - Expression: \\( 5 \\times (5 - 3) + 6 \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( 5 \\times 2 + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \\) (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 5**:\n  - Expression: \\( (5 + 5) \\times 3 - 6 \\)\n  - Calculation: \\( 10 \\times 3 - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24 \\) (This works!)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the expression that evaluates to 24 is:\n\n<<<[(5, +, 5), *, 3, -, 6]>>>"
