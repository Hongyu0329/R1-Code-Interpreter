    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 5, 6, and 5 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have the numbers 5, 5, 6, and 5.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Consider the operations**:\n   - We need to find a combination of operations and parentheses that result in 24.\n   - Since the numbers are relatively small, multiplication and division will likely play a key role in reaching 24.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider the expression: (5 * 5) - (6 / 5)\n     - Calculate: (5 * 5) = 25\n     - Calculate: (6 / 5) = 1.2\n     - Calculate: 25 - 1.2 = 23.8 (not 24, so this doesn't work)\n\n4. **Re-evaluate and try another approach**:\n   - Consider the expression: (5 + 5) * (6 - 5)\n     - Calculate: (5 + 5) = 10\n     - Calculate: (6 - 5) = 1\n     - Calculate: 10 * 1 = 10 (not 24, so this doesn't work)\n\n5. **Try another combination**:\n   - Consider the expression: 5 * (5 - (6 / 5))\n     - Calculate: (6 / 5) = 1.2\n     - Calculate: (5 - 1.2) = 3.8\n     - Calculate: 5 * 3.8 = 19 (not 24, so this doesn't work)\n\n6. **Try another combination**:\n   - Consider the expression: (5 * 5) - (6 - 5)\n     - Calculate: (5 * 5) = 25\n     - Calculate: (6 - 5) = 1\n     - Calculate: 25 - 1 = 24 (this works!)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the expression that works is:\n\n<<<[(5 * 5) - (6 - 5)]>>>"
