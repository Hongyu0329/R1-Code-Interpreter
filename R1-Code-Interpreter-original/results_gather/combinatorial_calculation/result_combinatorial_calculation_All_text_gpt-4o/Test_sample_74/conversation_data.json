    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 9, 1, and 3 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 3, 9, 1, and 3. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease values.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 24.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - One possible solution is to use multiplication and addition with parentheses to achieve the target:\n     - Expression: (3 * (9 - 1)) + 3\n     - Calculation: \n       - First, calculate inside the parentheses: 9 - 1 = 8\n       - Then, multiply: 3 * 8 = 24\n       - Finally, add the last number: 24 + 3 = 27 (This is incorrect, so let's try another approach)\n\n7. **Re-evaluation**:\n   - Let's try another approach:\n     - Expression: 3 * (9 - (1 / 3))\n     - Calculation:\n       - First, calculate inside the innermost parentheses: 1 / 3 = 0.333...\n       - Then, subtract from 9: 9 - 0.333... = 8.666...\n       - Finally, multiply by 3: 3 * 8.666... = 26 (This is also incorrect)\n\n8. **Correct Approach**:\n   - Expression: (3 * 9) - (1 * 3)\n   - Calculation:\n     - First, calculate the multiplication: 3 * 9 = 27\n     - Then, calculate the second multiplication: 1 * 3 = 3\n     - Finally, subtract: 27 - 3 = 24\n\nThe correct expression that evaluates to 24 is: <<<[3, *, 9, -, 1, *, 3]>>>"
