    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 2, 5, 2, and 2 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 2, 5, 2, and 2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication and parentheses to group operations:\n  - \\((2 \\times (5 + 2 + 2))\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the parentheses: \\(5 + 2 + 2 = 9\\)\n  - Multiply by the first 2: \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n\nThis does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider using division to adjust the result:\n  - \\((2 \\times 5) + (2 \\times 2)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - First part: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n  - Second part: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n  - Add the results: \\(10 + 4 = 14\\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to adjust the result:\n  - \\((2 + 5) \\times (2 + 2)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the first parentheses: \\(2 + 5 = 7\\)\n  - Inside the second parentheses: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\n  - Multiply the results: \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)\n\nThis is close but not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to adjust the result:\n  - \\((2 \\times 5) - (2 / 2)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - First part: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n  - Second part: \\(2 / 2 = 1\\)\n  - Subtract the results: \\(10 - 1 = 9\\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to adjust the result:\n  - \\((2 + 2) \\times (5 - 2)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the first parentheses: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\n  - Inside the second parentheses: \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n  - Multiply the results: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division to adjust the result:\n  - \\((2 \\times 2) \\times (5 - 2)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - First part: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n  - Inside the parentheses: \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n  - Multiply the results: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24.
