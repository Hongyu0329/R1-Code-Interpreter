  "question": "Given 3 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 10. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 3, 5, 5, the target values is: 10\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 5, and 5 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve a result of 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 3, 5, and 5. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations Available**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Parentheses for grouping.\n\n3. **Objective**: Achieve a result of 10 using the numbers and operations.\n\n4. **Exploration of Possibilities**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 3 + 5 + 5 = 13 (too high)\n     - 3 + 5 - 5 = 3 (too low)\n     - 3 - 5 + 5 = 3 (too low)\n     - 3 - 5 - 5 = -7 (too low)\n   - **Multiplication**:\n     - 3 * 5 * 5 = 75 (too high)\n     - 3 * 5 + 5 = 20 (too high)\n     - 3 + 5 * 5 = 28 (too high)\n     - 3 * 5 - 5 = 10 (this works!)\n   - **Division**:\n     - 3 / 5 + 5 = 5.6 (not an integer)\n     - 3 + 5 / 5 = 4 (too low)\n     - 3 / 5 * 5 = 3 (too low)\n     - 3 * 5 / 5 = 3 (too low)\n\n5. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, but in this case, we already found a solution without needing them.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The expression 3 * 5 - 5 = 10 is valid and uses each number exactly once in the given order.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression that results in 10 is:\n\n<<<[3, *, 5, -, 5]>>>"
