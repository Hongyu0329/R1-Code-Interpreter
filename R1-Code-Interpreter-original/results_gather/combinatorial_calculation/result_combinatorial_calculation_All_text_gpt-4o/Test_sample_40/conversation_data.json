    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 9) to achieve a result of 100. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have six numbers: 9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 9.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n   - The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once.\n   - The result must be 100.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which combination results in 100.\n   - Since the numbers are fixed in order, we need to strategically place operations and parentheses.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the value.\n   - Use parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n4. **Calculate step by step**:\n   - Let's try a combination: 9 * 5 + 6 * (4 + 6) - 9\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first: (4 + 6) = 10\n   - Then, calculate the multiplication: 6 * 10 = 60\n   - Next, calculate the first multiplication: 9 * 5 = 45\n   - Add the results: 45 + 60 = 105\n   - Finally, subtract 9: 105 - 9 = 96\n\n   This combination does not yield 100, so we need to try another approach.\n\n5. **Refine the approach**:\n   - Let's try another combination: 9 * (5 + 6) - 4 + 6 + 9\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first: (5 + 6) = 11\n   - Then, calculate the multiplication: 9 * 11 = 99\n   - Add the remaining numbers: 99 - 4 + 6 + 9\n   - Calculate step by step: 99 - 4 = 95, 95 + 6 = 101, 101 + 9 = 110\n\n   This combination also does not yield 100, so we need to try another approach.\n\n6. **Try another combination**:\n   - Let's try: 9 * 5 + 6 * 4 + 6 + 9\n   - Calculate the multiplications first: 9 * 5 = 45, 6 * 4 = 24\n   - Add the results: 45 + 24 = 69\n   - Add the remaining numbers: 69 + 6 + 9\n   - Calculate step by step: 69 + 6 = 75, 75 + 9 = 84\n\n   This combination also does not yield 100, so we need to try another approach.\n\n7. **Final attempt**:\n   - Let's try: 9 * 5 + 6 * (4 + 6) - 9\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first: (4 + 6) = 10\n   - Then, calculate the multiplication: 6 * 10 = 60\n   - Next, calculate the first multiplication: 9 * 5 = 45\n   - Add the results: 45 + 60 = 105\n   - Finally, subtract 9: 105 - 9 = 96\n\n   This combination also does not yield 100, so we need to try another approach.\n\nAfter several attempts, it seems challenging to achieve exactly 100 with the given numbers and operations. However, let's try one more approach:\n\n8. **Successful combination**:\n   - Let's try: 9 * (5 + 6) + 4 * 6 - 9\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first: (5 + 6) = 11\n   - Then, calculate the multiplication: 9 * 11 = 99\n   - Calculate the second multiplication: 4 * 6 = 24\n   - Add the results: 99 + 24 = 123\n   - Finally, subtract 9: 123 - 9 = 114\n\n   This combination also does not yield 100, so we need to try another approach.\n\n9. **Final successful attempt**:\n   - Let's try: 9 * 5 + 6 * 4 + 6 + 9\n   - Calculate the multiplications first: 9 * 5 = 45, 6 * 4 = 24\n   - Add the results: 45 + 24 = 69\n   - Add the remaining numbers: 69 + 6 + 9\n   - Calculate step by step: 69 + 6 = 75, 75 + 9 = 84\n\n   This combination also does not yield 100, so we need to try another approach.\n\nAfter several attempts, it seems challenging to achieve exactly 100 with the given numbers and operations.
