    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 1, 3, and 4 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 3, 1, 3, and 4. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication and addition:\n  - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the parentheses: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n  - Multiply by the first 3: \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\)\n\nThis result is not 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - \\((3 + 1) \\times (3 + 4)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the first parentheses: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\)\n  - Inside the second parentheses: \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n  - Multiply the results: \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\)\n\nThis result is also not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use subtraction and multiplication:\n  - \\(3 \\times (4 + 3 - 1)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the parentheses: \\(4 + 3 - 1 = 6\\)\n  - Multiply by the first 3: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - \\(3 \\times 1 \\times 3 \\times 4\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Multiply all numbers: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n  - \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n  - \\(9 \\times 4 = 36\\)\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3) \\times 4\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n  - Multiply by the first 3: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n  - Multiply by the last 4: \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\)\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - \\((3 + 1) \\times 3 \\times 4\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the parentheses: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\)\n  - Multiply by the next 3: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n  - Multiply by the last 4: \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\)\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - \\((3 + 1) \\times (3 + 4)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the first parentheses: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\)\n  - Inside the second parentheses: \\(3 + 4 = 7\\)\n  - Multiply the results: \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\)\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - \\((3 \\times 1) + (3 \\times 4)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the first parentheses: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n  - Inside the second parentheses: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n  - Add the results: \\(3 + 12 = 15\\)\n\nThis result is not 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Use division and multiplication:\n  - \\((3 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 1)\\)\n\n- Calculate step by step:\n  - Inside the first parentheses: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n  - Inside the second parentheses: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n  - Add the results: \\(12 + 3 = 15\\)\n\nThis result is not 24.
