    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 8, 1, and 3 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 8, 1, and 3.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n   - The result must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 8 + 1 + 3 = 12\n     - 8 + 1 - 3 = 6\n     - 8 + 1 * 3 = 11\n     - 8 - 1 + 3 = 10\n     - 8 - 1 - 3 = 4\n     - 8 - 1 * 3 = 5\n     - 8 * 1 + 3 = 11\n     - 8 * 1 - 3 = 5\n     - 8 * 1 * 3 = 24\n     - 8 / 1 + 3 = 11\n     - 8 / 1 - 3 = 5\n     - 8 / 1 * 3 = 24\n\n3. **Check for parentheses usage**:\n   - Use parentheses to change the order of operations:\n     - (8 + 1) * 3 = 27\n     - (8 - 1) * 3 = 21\n     - (8 * 1) + 3 = 11\n     - (8 / 1) + 3 = 11\n     - 8 + (1 * 3) = 11\n     - 8 - (1 * 3) = 5\n     - 8 * (1 + 3) = 32\n     - 8 / (1 + 3) = 2\n     - 8 + (1 + 3) = 12\n     - 8 - (1 + 3) = 4\n\n4. **Identify the correct combination**:\n   - From the above calculations, the combination that results in 10 is:\n     - 8 - 1 + 3 = 10\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   - According to the required format, the answer should be presented as a list of values and symbols.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[8, -, 1, +, 3]>>>"
