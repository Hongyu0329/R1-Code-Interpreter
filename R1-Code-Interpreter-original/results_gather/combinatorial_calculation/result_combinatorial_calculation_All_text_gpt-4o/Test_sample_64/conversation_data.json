    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 7, and 9 in the given order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 7, 7, and 9.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Since the numbers are relatively large, simple addition or multiplication is unlikely to yield 10 directly.\n   - Subtraction and division might be more useful, especially when combined with parentheses to alter the order of operations.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**:\n   - Start with basic operations and then introduce parentheses to see if they help achieve the target.\n\n4. **Evaluate potential expressions**:\n   - **Without parentheses**:\n     - \\(7 + 7 + 9 = 23\\)\n     - \\(7 + 7 - 9 = 5\\)\n     - \\(7 - 7 + 9 = 9\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 7 \\times 9 = 441\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 7 + 9 = 58\\)\n     - \\(7 + 7 \\times 9 = 70\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 9 - 7 = 56\\)\n     - \\(7 \\div 7 + 9 = 10\\) (This is a valid expression)\n\n5. **Verify the valid expression**:\n   - \\(7 \\div 7 = 1\\)\n   - \\(1 + 9 = 10\\)\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The expression \\(7 \\div 7 + 9\\) results in 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[7, /, 7, +, 9]>>>"
