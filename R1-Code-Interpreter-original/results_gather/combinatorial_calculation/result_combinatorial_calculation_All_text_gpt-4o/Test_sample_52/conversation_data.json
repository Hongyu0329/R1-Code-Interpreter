    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 4, and 5 in that order, results in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 9, 4, and 5.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n   - The result must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 9 + 4 + 5 = 18\n     - 9 + 4 - 5 = 8\n     - 9 + 4 * 5 = 29\n     - 9 + 4 / 5 = 9.8\n     - 9 - 4 + 5 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 9 - 4 - 5 = 0\n     - 9 - 4 * 5 = -11\n     - 9 - 4 / 5 = 8.2\n     - 9 * 4 + 5 = 41\n     - 9 * 4 - 5 = 31\n     - 9 * 4 * 5 = 180\n     - 9 * 4 / 5 = 7.2\n     - 9 / 4 + 5 = 7.25\n     - 9 / 4 - 5 = -2.75\n     - 9 / 4 * 5 = 11.25\n     - 9 / 4 / 5 = 0.45\n\n3. **Consider using parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, but since we already found a solution without them, we can verify if parentheses are necessary.\n   - For example, (9 - 4) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10, which confirms our earlier solution.\n\n4. **Verify the solution**:\n   - The expression 9 - 4 + 5 = 10 satisfies all the constraints: it uses each number once, in the given order, and results in 10.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<[9, -, 4, +, 5]>>>"
