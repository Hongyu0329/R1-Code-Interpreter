    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 8, and 5 in the given order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 7, 8, and 5. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), as well as parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 7 + 8 + 5 = 20\n     - 7 + 8 - 5 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 7 - 8 + 5 = 4\n     - 7 - 8 - 5 = -6\n   - **Multiplication and Division**:\n     - 7 * 8 * 5 = 280\n     - 7 * 8 / 5 = 11.2\n     - 7 / 8 * 5 = 4.375\n     - 7 / 8 / 5 = 0.175\n   - **Combining Operations**:\n     - 7 + (8 * 5) = 47\n     - (7 + 8) * 5 = 75\n     - 7 * (8 + 5) = 91\n     - (7 * 8) + 5 = 61\n     - 7 + 8 / 5 = 8.6\n     - (7 + 8) / 5 = 3\n     - 7 / (8 + 5) = 0.538\n     - (7 / 8) + 5 = 5.875\n\n3. **Identifying the Solution**:\n   - From the above calculations, the combination that results in 10 is: 7 + 8 - 5 = 10.\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**:\n   - According to the required format, we need to express this solution as a list of values and symbols.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[7, +, 8, -, 5]>>>"
