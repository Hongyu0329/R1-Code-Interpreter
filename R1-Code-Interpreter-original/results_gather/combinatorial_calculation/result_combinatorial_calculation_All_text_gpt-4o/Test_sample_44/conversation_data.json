    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (9, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8) to achieve a result of 100. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have six numbers: 9, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n   - The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once.\n   - The result must be 100.\n\n2. **Consider Possible Operations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which combination results in 100.\n   - We need to be mindful of the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS rules).\n\n3. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Start by trying simple operations and gradually introduce parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Consider the impact of multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the result.\n\n4. **Strategic Use of Parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can be used to group numbers and operations to prioritize certain calculations.\n   - This can help in achieving the target result by altering the natural precedence of operations.\n\n5. **Iterate and Adjust**:\n   - If a combination doesn't work, adjust the operations and parentheses and try again.\n   - Keep track of the results to avoid repeating unsuccessful attempts.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n\n- Use parentheses to group the first three numbers and perform operations within the group.\n- Use multiplication and addition to achieve the target.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n- Start with the first three numbers: 9, 9, 4.\n- Group them with parentheses and perform operations: (9 + 9) * 4 = 72.\n- Now, use the remaining numbers: 6, 2, 8.\n- Add 6 to the result: 72 + 6 = 78.\n- Add 2 to the result: 78 + 2 = 80.\n- Finally, add 8 to the result: 80 + 8 = 88.\n\nThis approach doesn't yield 100, so let's try another combination:\n\n- Use parentheses to group the first four numbers: (9 + 9) * (4 + 6) = 18 * 10 = 180.\n- Subtract 2: 180 - 2 = 178.\n- Subtract 8: 178 - 8 = 170.\n\nThis still doesn't yield 100, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses to group the first two numbers and the last two numbers: (9 * 9) + (4 * 6) + 2 + 8.\n- Calculate: 81 + 24 + 2 + 8 = 115.\n\nThis approach also doesn't yield 100, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses to group the first three numbers and perform operations: (9 * 9) + 4 = 85.\n- Subtract 6: 85 - 6 = 79.\n- Multiply by 2: 79 * 2 = 158.\n- Subtract 8: 158 - 8 = 150.\n\nThis approach also doesn't yield 100, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses to group the first three numbers and perform operations: (9 * 9) - 4 = 77.\n- Add 6: 77 + 6 = 83.\n- Multiply by 2: 83 * 2 = 166.\n- Subtract 8: 166 - 8 = 158.\n\nThis approach also doesn't yield 100, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses to group the first three numbers and perform operations: (9 * 9) - 4 = 77.\n- Add 6: 77 + 6 = 83.\n- Multiply by 2: 83 * 2 = 166.\n- Subtract 8: 166 - 8 = 158.\n\nThis approach also doesn't yield 100, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Use parentheses to group the first three numbers and perform operations: (9 * 9) -
