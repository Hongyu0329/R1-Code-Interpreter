    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the numbers 1, 6, 7, 2, and 8 to achieve the target value of 78. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 1, 6, 7, 2, and 8.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The final result of the expression must be 78.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**:\n   - Addition and multiplication are straightforward, but multiplication can significantly increase the value.\n   - Subtraction and division can decrease the value, and division should be used carefully to avoid fractions unless they simplify the expression.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, which is crucial for achieving the target value.\n\n3. **Initial Attempts**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition as they can help reach higher values.\n   - Try to group numbers using parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Consider the expression: (1 + 6) * 7 + 2 * 8\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - (1 + 6) = 7\n     - 7 * 7 = 49\n     - 2 * 8 = 16\n     - 49 + 16 = 65 (This is not 78, so adjust the operations)\n\n5. **Adjust the Operations**:\n   - Try another combination: 1 + (6 * 7) + (2 * 8)\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 6 * 7 = 42\n     - 2 * 8 = 16\n     - 1 + 42 + 16 = 59 (Still not 78, continue adjusting)\n\n6. **Refine the Expression**:\n   - Try: 1 + (6 * 7) + 2 * 8\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 6 * 7 = 42\n     - 2 * 8 = 16\n     - 1 + 42 = 43\n     - 43 + 16 = 59 (Still not correct, try another approach)\n\n7. **Final Attempt**:\n   - Try: (1 + 6) * (7 + 2) + 8\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 1 + 6 = 7\n     - 7 + 2 = 9\n     - 7 * 9 = 63\n     - 63 + 8 = 71 (Still not correct, continue refining)\n\n8. **Correct Expression**:\n   - Try: (1 + 6) * 7 + 2 + 8\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 1 + 6 = 7\n     - 7 * 7 = 49\n     - 49 + 2 = 51\n     - 51 + 8 = 59 (Still not correct, try another approach)\n\n9. **Successful Expression**:\n   - Try: 1 + 6 * (7 + 2) + 8\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 7 + 2 = 9\n     - 6 * 9 = 54\n     - 1 + 54 = 55\n     - 55 + 8 = 63 (Still not correct, continue refining)\n\n10. **Final Correct Expression**:\n    - Try: 1 + 6 * 7 + 2 * 8\n    - Calculate step by step:\n      - 6 * 7 = 42\n      - 2 * 8 = 16\n      - 1 + 42 = 43\n      - 43 + 16 = 59 (Still not correct, try another approach)\n\n11. **Correct Expression**:\n    -
