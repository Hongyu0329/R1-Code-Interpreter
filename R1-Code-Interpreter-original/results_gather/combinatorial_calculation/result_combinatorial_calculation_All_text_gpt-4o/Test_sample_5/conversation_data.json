    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 1, and 7 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 4, 1, and 7.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, so they are crucial in finding the correct expression.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**:\n   - Start with simple operations and then introduce parentheses to see if they help achieve the target value.\n\n4. **Evaluate potential expressions**:\n   - Without parentheses: \n     - 4 + 1 + 7 = 12 (not 10)\n     - 4 + 1 - 7 = -2 (not 10)\n     - 4 * 1 * 7 = 28 (not 10)\n     - 4 / 1 / 7 = 0.571 (not 10)\n     - 4 + 1 * 7 = 11 (not 10)\n     - 4 * 1 + 7 = 11 (not 10)\n     - 4 - 1 + 7 = 10 (this works!)\n\n5. **Verify the correct expression**:\n   - The expression 4 - 1 + 7 = 10 satisfies all the conditions:\n     - Uses each number exactly once.\n     - Uses the numbers in the given order.\n     - Results in the target value of 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is:\n\n<<<[4, -, 1, +, 7]>>>"
