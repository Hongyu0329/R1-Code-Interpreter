    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the given numbers (8, 4, 5, 7, 4) to achieve the target value of 78. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 8, 4, 5, 7, 4.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The final result of the expression must be 78.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The target value, 78, is relatively large compared to the individual numbers, suggesting that multiplication might be necessary to reach it.\n   - Division might be less useful since it typically reduces the value, and we need to increase it to reach 78.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication, as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to control the order of operations and group numbers effectively.\n\n4. **Formulate Possible Expressions**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 78.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - Let's try the expression: 8 * (4 + 5) + 7 + 4\n     - Calculate inside the parentheses first: 4 + 5 = 9\n     - Multiply: 8 * 9 = 72\n     - Add the remaining numbers: 72 + 7 + 4 = 83 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: 8 * 4 + 5 * 7 + 4\n     - Multiply: 8 * 4 = 32\n     - Multiply: 5 * 7 = 35\n     - Add the results: 32 + 35 + 4 = 71 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: (8 * 4) + (5 * 7) + 4\n     - Multiply: 8 * 4 = 32\n     - Multiply: 5 * 7 = 35\n     - Add the results: 32 + 35 + 4 = 71 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: 8 * 4 + 5 + 7 * 4\n     - Multiply: 8 * 4 = 32\n     - Multiply: 7 * 4 = 28\n     - Add the results: 32 + 5 + 28 = 65 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: 8 * (4 + 5) + 7 - 4\n     - Calculate inside the parentheses first: 4 + 5 = 9\n     - Multiply: 8 * 9 = 72\n     - Add and subtract the remaining numbers: 72 + 7 - 4 = 75 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: 8 * 4 + (5 + 7) * 4\n     - Multiply: 8 * 4 = 32\n     - Calculate inside the parentheses first: 5 + 7 = 12\n     - Multiply: 12 * 4 = 48\n     - Add the results: 32 + 48 = 80 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: 8 * 4 + 5 + 7 + 4\n     - Multiply: 8 * 4 = 32\n     - Add the remaining numbers: 32 + 5 + 7 + 4 = 48 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: 8 * 4 + 5 * (7 + 4)\n     - Multiply: 8 * 4 = 32\n     - Calculate inside the parentheses first: 7 + 4 = 11\n     - Multiply: 5 * 11 = 55\n     - Add the results: 32 + 55 = 87 (This is not 78, so this expression doesn't work)\n   - Try another expression: 8 * 4 + 5 + 7 * 4\n     -
