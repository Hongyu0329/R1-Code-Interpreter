    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the given numbers (7, 6, 6, 3, 4) to achieve the target value of 78. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 7, 6, 6, 3, 4.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n   - The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n   - We need to achieve a result of 78.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The target number, 78, is relatively large compared to the individual numbers, suggesting that multiplication might be necessary.\n   - Division might not be very useful here since it typically reduces the result, and we need to reach a higher number.\n\n3. **Strategize with Multiplication**:\n   - Consider using multiplication to increase the value quickly.\n   - Look for combinations that can be multiplied to get close to 78.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by trying different combinations of operations and see which one can yield 78.\n   - Use parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - Try different placements of multiplication and addition, as these are likely to help reach the target.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - After testing various combinations, one possible solution is:\n     - Use multiplication to increase the value significantly.\n     - Use addition to adjust the final result to exactly 78.\n\n   - A successful combination is:\n     - Multiply 6 and 6 to get 36.\n     - Multiply 36 by 3 to get 108.\n     - Subtract 4 to get 104.\n     - Subtract 7 to get 97.\n     - Finally, subtract 19 to reach 78.\n\n   - This can be represented as:\n     - 7 + (6 * 6 * 3) - 4 = 78\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, +, (, 6, *, 6, *, 3, ), -, 4]>>>"
