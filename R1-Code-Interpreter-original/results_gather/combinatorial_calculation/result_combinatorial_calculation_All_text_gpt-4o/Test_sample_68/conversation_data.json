    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 3, and 6 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 7, 3, and 6. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 7 + 3 + 6 = 16\n     - 7 + 3 - 6 = 4\n     - 7 - 3 + 6 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 7 - 3 - 6 = -2\n\n   - **Multiplication and Division**:\n     - 7 * 3 * 6 = 126\n     - 7 * 3 / 6 = 3.5\n     - 7 / 3 * 6 = 14\n     - 7 / 3 / 6 = 0.388...\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations:\n     - (7 + 3) * 6 = 60\n     - (7 - 3) * 6 = 24\n     - 7 * (3 + 6) = 63\n     - 7 * (3 - 6) = -21\n     - (7 + 3) / 6 = 1.666...\n     - (7 - 3) / 6 = 0.666...\n     - 7 / (3 + 6) = 0.777...\n     - 7 / (3 - 6) = -2.333...\n\n4. **Identifying the Solution**:\n   - From the above calculations, the expression that results in 10 is: 7 - 3 + 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression using the numbers 7, 3, and 6 in order to achieve the target value of 10 is:\n\n<<<[7, -, 3, +, 6]>>>"
