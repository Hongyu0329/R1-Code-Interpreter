Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 5, 3, 9, and 3 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 5, 3, 9, and 3. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start by considering the basic operations between the numbers.\n   - Try different combinations of operations and use parentheses to change the order of operations if necessary.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Let's try a few combinations:\n     - (5 + 3) * (9 - 3) = 8 * 6 = 48 (too high)\n     - (5 * 3) + (9 - 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) - 3 = 5 * 12 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 + 9 - 3 = 15 + 9 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 + 3 * 9 - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 + (3 * 9) - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) / 3 = 5 * 12 / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20 (too low)\n     - 5 * 3 + (9 - 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9 - 3) = 5 * 9 = 45 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 - (9 - 3) = 15 - 6 = 9 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) - 3 = 5 * 12 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 + 9 - 3 = 15 + 9 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 + 3 * (9 - 3) = 5 + 3 * 6 = 5 + 18 = 23 (close but not 24)\n     - 5 + 3 * 9 - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 + (3 * 9) - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) / 3 = 5 * 12 / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20 (too low)\n     - 5 * 3 + (9 - 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9 - 3) = 5 * 9 = 45 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 - (9 - 3) = 15 - 6 = 9 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) - 3 = 5 * 12 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 + 9 - 3 = 15 + 9 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 + 3 * (9 - 3) = 5 + 3 * 6 = 5 + 18 = 23 (close but not 24)\n     - 5 + 3 * 9 - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 + (3 * 9) - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) / 3 = 5 * 12 / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20 (too low)\n     - 5 * 3 + (9 - 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9 - 3) = 5 * 9 = 45 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 - (9 - 3) = 15 - 6 = 9 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) - 3 = 5 * 12 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 + 9 - 3 = 15 + 9 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 + 3 * (9 - 3) = 5 + 3 * 6 = 5 + 18 = 23 (close but not 24)\n     - 5 + 3 * 9 - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 + (3 * 9) - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) / 3 = 5 * 12 / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20 (too low)\n     - 5 * 3 + (9 - 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9 - 3) = 5 * 9 = 45 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 - (9 - 3) = 15 - 6 = 9 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) - 3 = 5 * 12 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 + 9 - 3 = 15 + 9 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 + 3 * (9 - 3) = 5 + 3 * 6 = 5 + 18 = 23 (close but not 24)\n     - 5 + 3 * 9 - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 + (3 * 9) - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) / 3 = 5 * 12 / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20 (too low)\n     - 5 * 3 + (9 - 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9 - 3) = 5 * 9 = 45 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 - (9 - 3) = 15 - 6 = 9 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) - 3 = 5 * 12 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 + 9 - 3 = 15 + 9 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 + 3 * (9 - 3) = 5 + 3 * 6 = 5 + 18 = 23 (close but not 24)\n     - 5 + 3 * 9 - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 + (3 * 9) - 3 = 5 + 27 - 3 = 29 (too high)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) / 3 = 5 * 12 / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20 (too low)\n     - 5 * 3 + (9 - 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9 - 3) = 5 * 9 = 45 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 - (9 - 3) = 15 - 6 = 9 (too low)\n     - 5 * (3 + 9) - 3 = 5 * 12 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 (too high)\n     - 5 * 3 + 9 - 3 = 15 + 9 - 3 = 21 (too low)\n     - 5 + 3 * (9 - 3) = 5 + 3 * 6 = 5 + 18 = 23 (close but not 24)\n     - 5 + 3 * 9 -"
