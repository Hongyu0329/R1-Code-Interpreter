    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (7, 9, 8, 6, 5) to achieve the target value of 69. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 7, 9, 8, 6, and 5.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The final result of the expression must be 69.\n\n2. **Consider Possible Operations**:\n   - Since the target is 69, which is relatively large, multiplication might be necessary to reach this value.\n   - Division could be used to adjust the result, but it must be used carefully to avoid non-integer results unless they are part of a larger integer calculation.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, which is crucial in reaching the target.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Logical Steps**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication as it can quickly increase the value.\n   - Try to balance the operations to reach exactly 69.\n\n4. **Formulate a Potential Solution**:\n   - Consider using multiplication first to increase the value significantly.\n   - Use addition or subtraction to adjust the result.\n   - Use parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n5. **Construct the Expression**:\n   - One possible way to reach 69 is by using the expression: (7 + 9) * (8 - 6) + 5.\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - (7 + 9) = 16\n     - (8 - 6) = 2\n     - 16 * 2 = 32\n     - 32 + 5 = 37 (This does not reach 69, so this approach needs adjustment)\n\n6. **Re-evaluate and Adjust**:\n   - Try another combination: 7 * 9 + 8 + 6 - 5\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 7 * 9 = 63\n     - 63 + 8 = 71\n     - 71 + 6 = 77\n     - 77 - 5 = 72 (This is still not 69, so continue adjusting)\n\n7. **Final Adjustment**:\n   - Try: 7 * (9 + 8) - 6 + 5\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 9 + 8 = 17\n     - 7 * 17 = 119\n     - 119 - 6 = 113\n     - 113 + 5 = 118 (This is incorrect, continue adjusting)\n\n8. **Correct Solution**:\n   - After several trials, the correct expression is: 7 * 9 + 8 - 6 / 5\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 7 * 9 = 63\n     - 63 + 8 = 71\n     - 71 - (6 / 5) = 69 (This is incorrect due to division, continue adjusting)\n\n9. **Final Correct Expression**:\n   - The correct expression is: (7 * 9) + (8 * 6) - 5\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 7 * 9 = 63\n     - 8 * 6 = 48\n     - 63 + 48 = 111\n     - 111 - 5 = 106 (This is incorrect, continue adjusting)\n\n10. **Final Correct Expression**:\n   - The correct expression is: 7 * 9 + 8 + 6 - 5\n   - Calculate step by step:\n     - 7 * 9 = 63\n     - 63 + 8 = 71\n     - 71 + 6 = 77\n     - 77 - 5 = 72 (This is incorrect, continue adjusting)\n\n11. **Final Correct Expression**:\n   -
