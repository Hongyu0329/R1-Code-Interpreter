    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses between the numbers 9, 7, 1, 1, and 3 to achieve the target value of 78. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 9, 7, 1, 1, and 3.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 78.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The target value, 78, is relatively large compared to the numbers we have, suggesting that multiplication might be necessary to reach such a high value.\n   - The presence of two 1s might be useful in operations that do not change the value significantly, such as multiplication or addition.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication as a primary operation to increase the value.\n   - Consider how parentheses can change the order of operations to achieve the desired result.\n\n4. **Constructing the Expression**:\n   - Begin with the largest number, 9, and consider multiplying it with other numbers to increase the value.\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they can lead to 78.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - One possible approach is to multiply 9 and 7 first, as they are the largest numbers: \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\).\n   - Then, consider how to use the remaining numbers (1, 1, 3) to reach 78 from 63.\n   - Adding 15 to 63 gives 78, so we need to form 15 using 1, 1, and 3.\n\n6. **Forming 15 with Remaining Numbers**:\n   - Notice that \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\), and we can form 5 by adding the two 1s and the 3: \\(1 + 1 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   - Combine these observations into a single expression: \\((9 \\times 7) + (1 + 1 + 3) = 78\\).\n\nTherefore, the expression that satisfies all conditions is:\n\n<<<[9, *, 7, +, (, 1, +, 1, +, 3, )]>>>"
