Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols.

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 9, 2, 3, and 8 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 9, 2, 3, and 8. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Strategy**: \n   - Start by considering the impact of multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the value.\n   - Use parentheses to control the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n- Consider the expression: \\( (9 - 2) \\times (3 + 8) \\).\n\n6. **Calculation**:\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n     - \\( 9 - 2 = 7 \\)\n     - \\( 3 + 8 = 11 \\)\n   - Then multiply the results:\n     - \\( 7 \\times 11 = 77 \\)\n\nThis does not give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( 9 \\times 2 + 3 \\times 8 \\).\n\n7. **Calculation**:\n   - Perform the multiplications first:\n     - \\( 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\)\n     - \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\)\n   - Then add the results:\n     - \\( 18 + 24 = 42 \\)\n\nThis also does not give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( 9 \\times (2 + 3) - 8 \\).\n\n8. **Calculation**:\n   - Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n     - \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\)\n   - Then multiply:\n     - \\( 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\)\n   - Finally, subtract:\n     - \\( 45 - 8 = 37 \\)\n\nThis still does not give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( (9 \\times 2) + (3 \\times 8) \\).\n\n9. **Calculation**:\n   -

(2 + 8) \\).\n\n11. **Calculation**:\n    - Perform the multiplication first:\n      - \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)\n    - Calculate inside the parentheses:\n      - \\( 2 + 8 = 10 \\)\n    - Then subtract:\n      - \\( 27 - 10 = 17 \\)\n\nThis still does not give us 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( (9 \\times 2) + (3 \\times 8) \\).\n\n12. **Calculation**:\n    - Perform the multiplications first:\n      -
