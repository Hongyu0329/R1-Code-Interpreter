    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (7, 4, 5, 7, 5, 7) to achieve a result of 100. We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have six numbers: 7, 4, 5, 7, 5, 7.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n   - The order of numbers cannot be changed.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once.\n   - The result must be 100.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively small, so multiplication might be necessary to reach 100.\n   - Division can be tricky since it can lead to non-integer results, which might complicate reaching exactly 100.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, which might be crucial.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition, as they are more likely to increase the result to 100.\n   - Consider using parentheses to group operations and change precedence.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Construction**:\n   - Try to form larger numbers through multiplication and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - For example, multiplying some of the 7s and 5s can quickly increase the total.\n\n5. **Testing Combinations**:\n   - After several trials, one possible combination is:\n     - Group the first three numbers (7, 4, 5) and multiply them: (7 * 4 * 5) = 140.\n     - Subtract the next number (7): 140 - 7 = 133.\n     - Subtract the next number (5): 133 - 5 = 128.\n     - Subtract the last number (7): 128 - 7 = 121.\n     - This approach doesn't work, so adjust the operations.\n\n6. **Correct Combination**:\n   - After testing various combinations, the correct sequence is:\n     - Multiply the first two numbers: 7 * 4 = 28.\n     - Add the next number: 28 + 5 = 33.\n     - Multiply by the next number: 33 * 7 = 231.\n     - Subtract the next number: 231 - 5 = 226.\n     - Subtract the last number: 226 - 7 = 219.\n     - This still doesn't work, so continue adjusting.\n\n7. **Final Solution**:\n   - After further adjustments, the correct sequence is:\n     - Multiply the first two numbers: 7 * 4 = 28.\n     - Add the next number: 28 + 5 = 33.\n     - Multiply by the next number: 33 * 7 = 231.\n     - Subtract the next number: 231 - 5 = 226.\n     - Subtract the last number: 226 - 7 = 219.\n   - This approach still doesn't work, so continue adjusting.\n\n8. **Correct Sequence**:\n   -
