    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 6, and 4 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 1, 6, and 4.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - The numbers must remain in the given order: 1, 6, 4.\n   - We need to achieve a result of 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 1 + 6 + 4 = 11\n     - 1 + 6 - 4 = 3\n     - 1 + 6 * 4 = 25\n     - 1 + 6 / 4 = 2.5\n     - 1 - 6 + 4 = -1\n     - 1 - 6 - 4 = -9\n     - 1 - 6 * 4 = -23\n     - 1 - 6 / 4 = -0.5\n     - 1 * 6 + 4 = 10\n     - 1 * 6 - 4 = 2\n     - 1 * 6 * 4 = 24\n     - 1 * 6 / 4 = 1.5\n     - 1 / 6 + 4 = 4.1667\n     - 1 / 6 - 4 = -3.8333\n     - 1 / 6 * 4 = 0.6667\n     - 1 / 6 / 4 = 0.0417\n\n3. **Identify the correct operation**:\n   - From the above calculations, the expression 1 * 6 + 4 results in 10.\n\n4. **Verify with parentheses**:\n   - Since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, parentheses are not needed in this case. The expression 1 * 6 + 4 is already correct.\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   - According to the required format, the answer should be presented as a list of values and symbols.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[1, *, 6, +, 4]>>>"
