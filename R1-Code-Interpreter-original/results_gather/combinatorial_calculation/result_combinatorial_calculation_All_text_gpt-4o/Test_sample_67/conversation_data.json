    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and possibly parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 6, 2, and 2 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 6, 2, and 2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 6 + 2 + 2 = 10. This is a valid solution.\n     - 6 + 2 - 2 = 6. This does not work.\n     - 6 - 2 + 2 = 6. This does not work.\n     - 6 - 2 - 2 = 2. This does not work.\n\n   - **Multiplication and Division**:\n     - 6 * 2 * 2 = 24. This is too large.\n     - 6 / 2 / 2 = 1.5. This is too small.\n     - 6 * 2 + 2 = 14. This is too large.\n     - 6 + 2 * 2 = 10. This is a valid solution.\n     - 6 * 2 - 2 = 10. This is a valid solution.\n     - 6 - 2 * 2 = 2. This does not work.\n     - 6 / 2 + 2 = 5. This does not work.\n     - 6 + 2 / 2 = 7. This does not work.\n     - 6 / 2 * 2 = 6. This does not work.\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations, but given the solutions found without them, they are not necessary in this case.\n\n4. **Valid Solutions**:\n   - We found three valid solutions:\n     - 6 + 2 + 2 = 10\n     - 6 + 2 * 2 = 10\n     - 6 * 2 - 2 = 10\n\n5. **Selecting a Solution**:\n   - We can choose any of the valid solutions. Let's choose the simplest one: 6 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[6, +, 2, +, 2]>>>"
