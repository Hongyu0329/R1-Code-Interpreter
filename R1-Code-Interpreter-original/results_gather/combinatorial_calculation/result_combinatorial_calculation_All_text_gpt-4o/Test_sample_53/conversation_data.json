    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 2, and 3 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 9, 2, and 3.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n   - Each number must be used exactly once and in the given order.\n   - The result must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 9 + 2 + 3 = 14\n     - 9 + 2 - 3 = 8\n     - 9 + 2 * 3 = 15\n     - 9 + 2 / 3 = 9.666...\n     - 9 - 2 + 3 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 9 - 2 - 3 = 4\n     - 9 - 2 * 3 = 3\n     - 9 - 2 / 3 = 8.333...\n     - 9 * 2 + 3 = 21\n     - 9 * 2 - 3 = 15\n     - 9 * 2 * 3 = 54\n     - 9 * 2 / 3 = 6\n     - 9 / 2 + 3 = 7.5\n     - 9 / 2 - 3 = 1.5\n     - 9 / 2 * 3 = 13.5\n     - 9 / 2 / 3 = 1.5\n\n3. **Consider using parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, so let's explore:\n     - (9 + 2) + 3 = 14\n     - (9 + 2) - 3 = 8\n     - (9 + 2) * 3 = 33\n     - (9 + 2) / 3 = 3.666...\n     - 9 + (2 + 3) = 14\n     - 9 + (2 - 3) = 8\n     - 9 + (2 * 3) = 15\n     - 9 + (2 / 3) = 9.666...\n     - 9 - (2 + 3) = 4\n     - 9 - (2 - 3) = 10 (This is another potential solution)\n     - 9 - (2 * 3) = 3\n     - 9 - (2 / 3) = 8.333...\n     - 9 * (2 + 3) = 45\n     - 9 * (2 - 3) = -9\n     - 9 * (2 * 3) = 54\n     - 9 * (2 / 3) = 6\n     - 9 / (2 + 3) = 1.8\n     - 9 / (2 - 3) = -9\n     - 9 / (2 * 3) = 1.5\n     - 9 / (2 / 3) = 13.5\n\n4. **Identify valid solutions**:\n   - From the above calculations, we found two valid solutions:\n     - 9 - 2 + 3 = 10\n     - 9 - (2 - 3) = 10\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   - The first solution can be represented as <<<[9, -, 2, +, 3]>>>\n   - The second solution can be represented as <<<[9, -, (, 2, -, 3, )]>>>\n\nSince the problem asks for a single answer, we can choose one of these solutions. Let's choose the first one for simplicity.\n\nFinal answer: <<<[9, -, 2, +, 3]>>>"
