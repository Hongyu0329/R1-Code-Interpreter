    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 7, 1, and 4 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 7, 1, and 4. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition**: \n     - 7 + 1 + 4 = 12 (not 10)\n     - 7 + (1 + 4) = 12 (not 10)\n     - (7 + 1) + 4 = 12 (not 10)\n   - **Subtraction**:\n     - 7 - 1 - 4 = 2 (not 10)\n     - 7 - (1 - 4) = 10 (this works)\n     - (7 - 1) - 4 = 2 (not 10)\n   - **Multiplication**:\n     - 7 * 1 * 4 = 28 (not 10)\n     - 7 * (1 * 4) = 28 (not 10)\n     - (7 * 1) * 4 = 28 (not 10)\n   - **Division**:\n     - 7 / 1 / 4 = 1.75 (not 10)\n     - 7 / (1 / 4) = 28 (not 10)\n     - (7 / 1) / 4 = 1.75 (not 10)\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - We found that using subtraction with parentheses gives us a valid solution:\n     - 7 - (1 - 4) = 7 - (-3) = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The correct combination of operations and parentheses that results in 10 is: 7 - (1 - 4).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[7, -, (, 1, -, 4, )]>>>"
