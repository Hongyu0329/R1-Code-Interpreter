    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 1, 5, and 1 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 4, 1, 5, and 1. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication and parentheses to group operations:\n  - Consider: \\( (4 + 1) \\times (5 - 1) \\)\n  - Calculate: \n    - \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\)\n    - \\( 5 - 1 = 4 \\)\n    - \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) (This is not 24, so try another combination)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - Consider: \\( 4 \\times (1 + 5 + 1) \\)\n  - Calculate:\n    - \\( 1 + 5 + 1 = 7 \\)\n    - \\( 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\) (This is not 24, so try another combination)\n\n- Try another combination:\n  - Consider: \\( 4 \\times 5 -
