    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 8, 5, 8, and 8 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 8, 5, 8, and 8. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n\n- Start with multiplication and division, as they have a higher impact on the result:\n  - Consider the expression: \\( (8 \\times (5 - (8 / 8))) \\)\n\n6. **Evaluation**:\n   - Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \\( 8 / 8 = 1 \\)\n   - Substitute back: \\( 5 - 1 = 4 \\)\n   - Substitute back: \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n\nThis does not yield 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( 8 \\times (5 - 8 + 8) \\)\n\n7. **Evaluation**:\n   - Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \\( 5 - 8 + 8 = 5 \\)\n   - Substitute back: \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( (8 + 8) \\times (8 - 5) \\)\n\n8. **Evaluation**:\n   - Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \\( 8 + 8 = 16 \\) and \\( 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n   - Substitute back: \\( 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( 8 \\times (8 - (5 - 8)) \\)\n\n9. **Evaluation**:\n   - Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \\( 5 - 8 = -3 \\)\n   - Substitute back: \\( 8 - (-3) = 11 \\)\n   - Substitute back: \\( 8 \\times 11 = 88 \\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( 8 \\times (8 - 5) + 8 \\)\n\n10. **Evaluation**:\n    - Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \\( 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n    - Substitute back: \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n    - Substitute back: \\( 24 + 8 = 32 \\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( 8 + 8 + 8 \\times (5 - 8) \\)\n\n11. **Evaluation**:\n    - Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \\( 5 - 8 = -3 \\)\n    - Substitute back: \\( 8 \\times (-3) = -24 \\)\n    - Substitute back: \\( 8 + 8 - 24 = -8 \\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Consider the expression: \\( 8 \\times (8 - 5) + 8 \\)\n\n12. **Evaluation**:\n    - Calculate the innermost parentheses first: \\( 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n    - Substitute back: \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n    - Substitute back: \\( 24 + 8 = 32 \\)\n\nThis also does not yield 24.
