    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 8, 2, and 6 in that order, results in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Consider the operations**: We have addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Evaluate simple operations**: \n   - 8 + 2 + 6 = 16\n   - 8 + 2 - 6 = 4\n   - 8 + 2 * 6 = 20\n   - 8 + 2 / 6 = 8.333...\n   - 8 - 2 + 6 = 12\n   - 8 - 2 - 6 = 0\n   - 8 - 2 * 6 = -4\n   - 8 - 2 / 6 = 7.666...\n   - 8 * 2 + 6 = 22\n   - 8 * 2 - 6 = 10\n   - 8 * 2 * 6 = 96\n   - 8 * 2 / 6 = 2.666...\n   - 8 / 2 + 6 = 10\n   - 8 / 2 - 6 = -2\n   - 8 / 2 * 6 = 24\n   - 8 / 2 / 6 = 0.666...\n\n3. **Evaluate with parentheses**:\n   - (8 + 2) * 6 = 60\n   - (8 + 2) / 6 = 1.666...\n   - (8 - 2) * 6 = 36\n   - (8 - 2) / 6 = 1\n   - (8 * 2) + 6 = 22\n   - (8 * 2) - 6 = 10\n   - (8 / 2) + 6 = 10\n   - (8 / 2) - 6 = -2\n   - 8 + (2 * 6) = 20\n   - 8 + (2 / 6) = 8.333...\n   - 8 - (2 * 6) = -4\n   - 8 - (2 / 6) = 7.666...\n   - 8 * (2 + 6) = 64\n   - 8 * (2 - 6) = -32\n   - 8 / (2 + 6) = 1\n   - 8 / (2 - 6) = -2.666...\n\n4. **Identify valid solutions**: From the above calculations, we find two valid solutions that result in 10:\n   - 8 * 2 - 6 = 10\n   - 8 / 2 + 6 = 10\n\n5. **Format the solutions**: According to the required format, we need to express these solutions as lists of values and symbols.\n\nThe solutions are:\n- <<<[8, *, 2, -, 6]>>>\n- <<<[8, /, 2, +, 6]>>>\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[8, *, 2, -, 6]>>> or <<<[8, /, 2, +, 6]>>>"
