    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 6, 3, and 7 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 6, 3, and 7. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 6 + 3 + 7 = 16\n     - 6 + 3 - 7 = 2\n     - 6 - 3 + 7 = 10 (This is a potential solution)\n     - 6 - 3 - 7 = -4\n\n   - **Multiplication and Division**:\n     - 6 * 3 * 7 = 126\n     - 6 * 3 / 7 = 18/7 (approximately 2.57)\n     - 6 / 3 * 7 = 14\n     - 6 / 3 / 7 = 2/7 (approximately 0.29)\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations:\n     - (6 + 3) * 7 = 63\n     - (6 - 3) * 7 = 21\n     - 6 * (3 + 7) = 60\n     - 6 * (3 - 7) = -24\n     - (6 + 3) / 7 = 9/7 (approximately 1.29)\n     - (6 - 3) / 7 = 3/7 (approximately 0.43)\n     - 6 / (3 + 7) = 6/10 = 0.6\n     - 6 / (3 - 7) = -1.5\n\n4. **Finding the Solution**:\n   - From the above calculations, the combination that results in 10 is:\n     - 6 - 3 + 7 = 10\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of operations to achieve the target value of 10 is:\n\n<<<[6, -, 3, +, 7]>>>"
