    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 8, 5, and 3 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 8, 5, and 3. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 8 + 5 + 3 = 16 (too high)\n     - 8 + 5 - 3 = 10 (this works)\n     - 8 - 5 + 3 = 6 (too low)\n     - 8 - 5 - 3 = 0 (too low)\n   - **Multiplication and Division**:\n     - 8 * 5 * 3 = 120 (too high)\n     - 8 * 5 / 3 = 13.33 (not an integer)\n     - 8 / 5 * 3 = 4.8 (not an integer)\n     - 8 / 5 / 3 = 0.53 (not an integer)\n   - **Combining Operations**:\n     - (8 + 5) * 3 = 39 (too high)\n     - (8 - 5) * 3 = 9 (close, but not 10)\n     - 8 * (5 + 3) = 64 (too high)\n     - 8 * (5 - 3) = 16 (too high)\n     - 8 / (5 + 3) = 1 (too low)\n     - 8 / (5 - 3) = 4 (too low)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The only combination that results in 10 is using addition and subtraction without any parentheses: 8 + 5 - 3 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[8, +, 5, -, 3]>>>"
