    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 8, 3, and 5 in that order, result in the value 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 1, 8, 3, and 5. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to group operations.\n\n3. **Target**: The result of the operations should be 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can significantly change the magnitude of the result.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one results in 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: (1 + 8) * (3 + 5)\n  - Calculate: (1 + 8) = 9\n  - Calculate: (3 + 5) = 8\n  - Multiply: 9 * 8 = 72 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 2**: 1 * (8 + 3) * 5\n  - Calculate: (8 + 3) = 11\n  - Multiply: 1 * 11 = 11\n  - Multiply: 11 * 5 = 55 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 3**: (1 + 8) * 3 - 5\n  - Calculate: (1 + 8) = 9\n  - Multiply: 9 * 3 = 27\n  - Subtract: 27 - 5 = 22 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 4**: 1 + 8 * 3 + 5\n  - Multiply: 8 * 3 = 24\n  - Add: 1 + 24 = 25\n  - Add: 25 + 5 = 30 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 5**: 1 + (8 * 3) - 5\n  - Multiply: 8 * 3 = 24\n  - Add: 1 + 24 = 25\n  - Subtract: 25 - 5 = 20 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 6**: 1 + 8 * (3 + 5)\n  - Calculate: (3 + 5) = 8\n  - Multiply: 8 * 8 = 64\n  - Add: 1 + 64 = 65 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 7**: (1 + 8) * 3 + 5\n  - Calculate: (1 + 8) = 9\n  - Multiply: 9 * 3 = 27\n  - Add: 27 + 5 = 32 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 8**: (1 + 8) * (3 - 5)\n  - Calculate: (1 + 8) = 9\n  - Calculate: (3 - 5) = -2\n  - Multiply: 9 * -2 = -18 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 9**: 1 * 8 * 3 + 5\n  - Multiply: 1 * 8 = 8\n  - Multiply: 8 * 3 = 24\n  - Add: 24 + 5 = 29 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 10**: 1 * (8 * 3) - 5\n  - Multiply: 8 * 3 = 24\n  - Multiply: 1 * 24 = 24\n  - Subtract: 24 - 5 = 19 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 11**: 1 + 8 + 3 * 5\n  - Add: 1 + 8 = 9\n  - Multiply: 3 * 5 = 15\n  - Add: 9 + 15 = 24 (This works!)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, we find that the combination 1 + 8 + 3 * 5 results in 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[1, +, 8, +, 3, *, 5]>>>"
