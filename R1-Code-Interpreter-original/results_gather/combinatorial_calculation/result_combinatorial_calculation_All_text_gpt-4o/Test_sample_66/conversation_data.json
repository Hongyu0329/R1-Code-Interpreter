    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 3, and 2 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve a result of 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 4, 3, and 2. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 (not 10)\n     - 4 + 3 - 2 = 5 (not 10)\n     - 4 - 3 + 2 = 3 (not 10)\n     - 4 - 3 - 2 = -1 (not 10)\n   - **Multiplication**:\n     - 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 (not 10)\n     - 4 * 3 + 2 = 14 (not 10)\n     - 4 + 3 * 2 = 10 (this works)\n     - 4 * 3 - 2 = 10 (this works)\n   - **Division**:\n     - 4 / 3 / 2 = 0.666... (not 10)\n     - 4 / 3 + 2 = 3.333... (not 10)\n     - 4 + 3 / 2 = 5.5 (not 10)\n     - 4 / 3 - 2 = -0.666... (not 10)\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, but since we already found two solutions without them, let's verify:\n     - (4 + 3) * 2 = 14 (not 10)\n     - 4 * (3 + 2) = 20 (not 10)\n     - (4 * 3) - 2 = 10 (this works)\n     - 4 + (3 * 2) = 10 (this works)\n\n4. **Valid Solutions**:\n   - We found two valid solutions:\n     - 4 + (3 * 2) = 10\n     - (4 * 3) - 2 = 10\n\n5. **Formatting the Answer**:\n   - According to the required format, we need to express these solutions as lists of values and symbols.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[4, +, (, 3, *, 2, )]>>> or <<<[(, 4, *, 3, ), -, 2]>>>"
