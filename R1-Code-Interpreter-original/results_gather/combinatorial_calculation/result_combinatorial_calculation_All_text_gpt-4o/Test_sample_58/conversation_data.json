    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 5, 5, and 9 in the given order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 5, 5, and 9.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Since the numbers are relatively small, we can try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see which one yields the result of 10.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**:\n   - Start with basic operations without parentheses:\n     - 5 + 5 + 9 = 19\n     - 5 + 5 - 9 = 1\n     - 5 + 5 * 9 = 50\n     - 5 + 5 / 9 ≈ 5.56\n     - 5 - 5 + 9 = 9\n     - 5 - 5 - 9 = -9\n     - 5 - 5 * 9 = -40\n     - 5 - 5 / 9 ≈ 4.44\n     - 5 * 5 + 9 = 34\n     - 5 * 5 - 9 = 16\n     - 5 * 5 * 9 = 225\n     - 5 * 5 / 9 ≈ 2.78\n     - 5 / 5 + 9 = 10\n     - 5 / 5 - 9 = -8\n     - 5 / 5 * 9 = 9\n     - 5 / 5 / 9 ≈ 0.11\n\n4. **Identify the correct combination**:\n   - From the above calculations, the expression 5 / 5 + 9 results in 10.\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Calculate 5 / 5 = 1\n   - Then, 1 + 9 = 10\n\nThus, the correct expression that results in 10 is 5 / 5 + 9.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[5, /, 5, +, 9]>>>"
