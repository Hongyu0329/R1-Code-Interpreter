    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 3, 7, and 1 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 3, 7, and 1.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - We can try different combinations of operations between the numbers.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, so they are crucial in forming the correct expression.\n\n3. **Try different combinations**:\n   - Start with basic operations without parentheses:\n     - 3 + 7 + 1 = 11 (not 10)\n     - 3 + 7 - 1 = 9 (not 10)\n     - 3 * 7 * 1 = 21 (not 10)\n     - 3 * 7 + 1 = 22 (not 10)\n     - 3 * 7 - 1 = 20 (not 10)\n     - 3 + 7 * 1 = 10 (this works, but let's check other possibilities)\n     - 3 - 7 + 1 = -3 (not 10)\n     - 3 - 7 - 1 = -5 (not 10)\n     - 3 / 7 + 1 = 1.428... (not 10)\n     - 3 / 7 - 1 = -0.571... (not 10)\n     - 3 + 7 / 1 = 10 (this also works)\n\n4. **Check with parentheses**:\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, but since we already found a valid expression without them, let's verify:\n     - (3 + 7) + 1 = 11 (not 10)\n     - (3 + 7) - 1 = 9 (not 10)\n     - 3 + (7 + 1) = 11 (not 10)\n     - 3 + (7 - 1) = 9 (not 10)\n     - (3 * 7) + 1 = 22 (not 10)\n     - (3 * 7) - 1 = 20 (not 10)\n     - 3 * (7 + 1) = 24 (not 10)\n     - 3 * (7 - 1) = 18 (not 10)\n     - (3 + 7) * 1 = 10 (this works)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The expression 3 + 7 * 1 = 10 is valid.\n   - The expression 3 + 7 / 1 = 10 is also valid.\n   - The expression (3 + 7) * 1 = 10 is valid.\n\nTherefore, one of the valid expressions is:\n\n<<<[3, +, 7, *, 1]>>>"
