    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 4, 2, and 5 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 4, 2, and 5. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 4 + 2 + 5 = 11 (too high)\n     - 4 + 2 - 5 = 1 (too low)\n     - 4 - 2 + 5 = 7 (too low)\n     - 4 - 2 - 5 = -3 (too low)\n   - **Multiplication**:\n     - 4 * 2 * 5 = 40 (too high)\n     - 4 * 2 + 5 = 13 (too high)\n     - 4 + 2 * 5 = 14 (too high)\n     - 4 * 2 - 5 = 3 (too low)\n     - 4 - 2 * 5 = -6 (too low)\n   - **Division**:\n     - 4 / 2 + 5 = 7 (too low)\n     - 4 + 2 / 5 = 4.4 (too low)\n     - 4 / 2 - 5 = -3 (too low)\n     - 4 - 2 / 5 = 3.6 (too low)\n     - 4 / 2 * 5 = 10 (this works!)\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations, but in this case, the direct operation 4 / 2 * 5 already gives us the desired result of 10.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The combination that works is using division and multiplication in the order: 4 / 2 * 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[4, /, 2, *, 5]>>>"
