  "question": "Given 4 integers between 1 and 9, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses) between these integers. Each number must be used exactly once and only once, and the final result should be 24. Note: The order of the numbers is determined by the input, and you cannot change the order of the numbers. You can only insert arithmetic operations or parentheses between the numbers.\nReturn the answer with a list of values and calculation symbols. Return your answer with the format <<<list of values and symbols>>>, like <<<[1, +, 3]>>> means 1+3, <<<[4, -, (, 6, , 9, )]>>> means 4-69*.Now the input numbers are: 4, 1, 6, 6, the target values is: 24\n Your answer:",

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 1, 6, and 6 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 4, 1, 6, and 6. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Strategy**: \n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease the value.\n   - Use parentheses to control the order of operations and group numbers effectively.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Consider the expression: \\( (4 + 1) \\times (6 - 6) \\). This simplifies to \\( 5 \\times 0 = 0 \\), which is not 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times (1 + 6) - 6 \\). This simplifies to \\( 4 \\times 7 - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22 \\), which is close but not 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times 6 - (1 + 6) \\). This simplifies to \\( 24 - 7 = 17 \\), which is not 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times (6 - 1) + 6 \\). This simplifies to \\( 4 \\times 5 + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26 \\), which is not 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times 6 - 6 + 1 \\). This simplifies to \\( 24 - 6 + 1 = 19 \\), which is not 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times 6 - (6 - 1) \\). This simplifies to \\( 24 - 5 = 19 \\), which is not 24.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times (6 - (6 - 1)) \\).
