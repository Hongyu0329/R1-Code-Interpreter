    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 1, 2, and 7 in that order, result in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 1, 2, and 7. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order. We can use the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n2. **Exploring Operations**:\n   - **Addition and Subtraction**: \n     - 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 (This works directly)\n     - 1 + 2 - 7 = -4\n     - 1 - 2 + 7 = 6\n     - 1 - 2 - 7 = -8\n   - **Multiplication**:\n     - 1 * 2 * 7 = 14\n     - 1 * 2 + 7 = 9\n     - 1 + 2 * 7 = 15\n     - 1 * (2 + 7) = 9\n     - (1 + 2) * 7 = 21\n   - **Division**:\n     - 1 / 2 + 7 = 7.5\n     - 1 + 2 / 7 = 1.2857\n     - 1 / (2 + 7) = 0.1111\n     - (1 + 2) / 7 = 0.4286\n\n3. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - We can use parentheses to change the order of operations:\n     - (1 + 2) + 7 = 10 (This works)\n     - (1 + 2) * 7 = 21\n     - 1 + (2 + 7) = 10 (This works)\n     - 1 + (2 * 7) = 15\n     - (1 * 2) + 7 = 9\n     - 1 * (2 + 7) = 9\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The expression that satisfies the condition of using each number exactly once in the given order and results in 10 is: 1 + 2 + 7 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[1, +, 2, +, 7]>>>"
