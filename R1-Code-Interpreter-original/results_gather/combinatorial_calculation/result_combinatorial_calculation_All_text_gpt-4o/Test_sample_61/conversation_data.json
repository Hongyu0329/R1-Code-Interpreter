    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 3, and 1 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve a result of 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 3, 3, and 1. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations Available**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Parentheses ().\n\n3. **Objective**: Formulate an expression using these numbers and operations that equals 10.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 (not 10)\n     - 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 (not 10)\n     - 3 * 3 * 1 = 9 (not 10)\n     - 3 * 3 + 1 = 10 (this works)\n     - 3 * 3 - 1 = 8 (not 10)\n     - 3 / 3 + 1 = 2 (not 10)\n     - 3 + 3 * 1 = 6 (not 10)\n     - 3 - 3 + 1 = 1 (not 10)\n     - 3 - 3 * 1 = 0 (not 10)\n     - 3 / 3 * 1 = 1 (not 10)\n\n5. **Using Parentheses**:\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n     - (3 + 3) * 1 = 6 (not 10)\n     - (3 * 3) + 1 = 10 (this works)\n     - (3 + 3) + 1 = 7 (not 10)\n     - (3 - 3) + 1 = 1 (not 10)\n     - (3 / 3) + 1 = 2 (not 10)\n     - 3 + (3 * 1) = 6 (not 10)\n     - 3 * (3 + 1) = 12 (not 10)\n     - 3 * (3 - 1) = 6 (not 10)\n     - 3 * (3 / 1) = 9 (not 10)\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The expression that satisfies the condition is (3 * 3) + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[3, *, 3, +, 1]>>>"
