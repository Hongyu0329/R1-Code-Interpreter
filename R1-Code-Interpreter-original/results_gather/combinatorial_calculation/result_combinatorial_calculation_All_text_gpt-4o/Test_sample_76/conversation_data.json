    "To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 8, 7, and 7 in the given order and apply arithmetic operations and parentheses to achieve the target value of 24. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the numbers 3, 8, 7, and 7. We need to use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n\n2. **Operations and Parentheses**: We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form expressions.\n\n3. **Target**: The expression must evaluate to 24.\n\n4. **Exploration**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and division, as they can quickly increase or decrease values.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n5. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Try different combinations of operations and parentheses to see if they yield 24.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1**: \n  - Expression: (3 * 8) - (7 / 7)\n  - Calculation: (3 * 8) = 24, (7 / 7) = 1, 24 - 1 = 23 (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 2**:\n  - Expression: (3 + 8) * (7 - 7)\n  - Calculation: (3 + 8) = 11, (7 - 7) = 0, 11 * 0 = 0 (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 3**:\n  - Expression: 3 * (8 - (7 / 7))\n  - Calculation: (7 / 7) = 1, (8 - 1) = 7, 3 * 7 = 21 (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 4**:\n  - Expression: (3 + 8) * 7 - 7\n  - Calculation: (3 + 8) = 11, 11 * 7 = 77, 77 - 7 = 70 (Not 24)\n\n- **Combination 5**:\n  - Expression: 3 * 8 - (7 - 7)\n  - Calculation: 3 * 8 = 24, (7 - 7) = 0, 24 - 0 = 24 (This works!)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, the expression that evaluates to 24 is:\n\n<<<[3, *, 8, -, (, 7, -, 7, )]>>>"
