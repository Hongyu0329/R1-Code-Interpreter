    "To solve this problem, we need to find a combination of arithmetic operations and parentheses that, when applied to the numbers 9, 8, and 8 in that order, results in the value 10. Let's analyze the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints**: \n   - We have three numbers: 9, 8, and 8.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 10.\n\n2. **Consider possible operations**:\n   - Start by considering simple operations without parentheses:\n     - 9 + 8 + 8 = 25\n     - 9 + 8 - 8 = 9\n     - 9 - 8 + 8 = 9\n     - 9 - 8 - 8 = -7\n     - 9 * 8 * 8 = 576\n     - 9 / 8 / 8 = 0.140625\n     - 9 + 8 * 8 = 73\n     - 9 * 8 + 8 = 80\n     - 9 * 8 - 8 = 64\n     - 9 - 8 * 8 = -55\n     - 9 / 8 + 8 = 9.125\n     - 9 + 8 / 8 = 10\n     - 9 / 8 - 8 = -7.875\n     - 9 - 8 / 8 = 8.0\n\n3. **Identify the correct expression**:\n   - From the above calculations, the expression that results in 10 is: 9 + 8 / 8.\n\n4. **Verify the expression**:\n   - Calculate 8 / 8 = 1.\n   - Then, 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   - The expression that satisfies the condition is 9 + 8 / 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<[9, +, 8, /, 8]>>>"
