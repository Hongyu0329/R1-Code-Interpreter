    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (4, 4, 2, 9, 7) to achieve the target value of 78. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have five numbers: 4, 4, 2, 9, 7.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The result of the expression must be 78.\n\n2. **Consider the Operations**:\n   - Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.\n   - Parentheses can be used to change the order of operations.\n\n3. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The target value is relatively large (78), so multiplication might be necessary to reach it.\n   - The numbers 9 and 7 are relatively large, so they might be useful in multiplication to reach a higher value.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication of larger numbers to get close to 78.\n   - Consider using parentheses to group operations and control the order of evaluation.\n\n5. **Formulate a Potential Solution**:\n   - Try to use multiplication to get a large intermediate result, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( (4 \\times 4) + (9 \\times 7) - 2 \\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Expression**:\n   - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\).\n   - Add the results: \\( 16 + 63 = 79 \\).\n   - Subtract 2: \\( 79 - 2 = 77 \\).\n\n7. **Adjust the Expression**:\n   - The above calculation gives 77, which is close to 78. We need to adjust the operations slightly.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times (4 + 2) + 9 \\times 7 \\).\n\n8. **Recalculate the Expression**:\n   - Calculate \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\).\n   - Add the results: \\( 24 + 63 = 87 \\).\n\n9. **Final Adjustment**:\n   - The above calculation gives 87, which is too high. We need to adjust the operations again.\n   - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times (4 + 2) + 9 + 7 \\).\n\n10. **Recalculate the Expression**:\n    - Calculate \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\).\n    - Add 9: \\( 24 + 9 = 33 \\).\n    - Add 7: \\( 33 + 7 = 40 \\).\n\n11. **Re-evaluate and Adjust**:\n    - The above calculation gives 40, which is too low. We need to find a different combination.\n    - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times 4 \\times 2 + 9 \\times 7 \\).\n\n12. **Recalculate the Expression**:\n    - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\).\n    - Add the results: \\( 32 + 63 = 95 \\).\n\n13. **Final Adjustment**:\n    - The above calculation gives 95, which is too high. We need to adjust the operations again.\n    - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times (4 + 2) \\times 9 - 7 \\).\n\n14. **Recalculate the Expression**:\n    - Calculate \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 24 \\times 9 = 216 \\).\n    - Subtract 7: \\( 216 - 7 = 209 \\).\n\n15. **Re-evaluate and Adjust**:\n    - The above calculation gives 209, which is too high. We need to find a different combination.\n    - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times 4 \\times 2 + 9 \\times 7 - 2 \\).\n\n16. **Recalculate the Expression**:\n    - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\).\n    - Add the results: \\( 32 + 63 = 95 \\).\n    - Subtract 2: \\( 95 - 2 = 93 \\).\n\n17. **Final Adjustment**:\n    - The above calculation gives 93, which is too high. We need to adjust the operations again.\n    - Consider the expression: \\( 4 \\times 4 \\times 2 + 9 + 7 \\).\n\n18. **Recalculate the Expression**:\n    - Calculate \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n    - Calculate \\( 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\).\n    - Add 9: \\( 32 + 9 = 41 \\).\n    - Add 7: \\( 41 + 7 = 48 \\).\n\n19. **Re-evaluate and Adjust**:\n    - The above calculation gives 48, which is too low.
