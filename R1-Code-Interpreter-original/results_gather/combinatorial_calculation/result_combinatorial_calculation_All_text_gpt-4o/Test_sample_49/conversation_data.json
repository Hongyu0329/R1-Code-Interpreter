    "To solve this problem, we need to insert arithmetic operations and parentheses between the given numbers (8, 9, 3, 1, 8, 5) to achieve a result of 100. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We have six numbers: 8, 9, 3, 1, 8, 5.\n   - We must use each number exactly once and in the given order.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to form the expression.\n   - The final result of the expression must be 100.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The numbers are relatively small, so multiplication might be necessary to reach 100.\n   - Division can be tricky since it can lead to non-integer results, which might complicate reaching exactly 100.\n   - Parentheses can change the order of operations, which is crucial in forming the correct expression.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start by considering multiplication and addition as primary operations to reach a larger number.\n   - Use subtraction and division carefully to adjust the result to exactly 100.\n   - Experiment with different placements of parentheses to alter the order of operations.\n\n4. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Let's try to form an expression by strategically placing operations and parentheses:\n   - Consider the expression: (8 * 9) + (3 * (1 + 8)) + 5\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - 8 * 9 = 72\n       - 1 + 8 = 9\n       - 3 * 9 = 27\n       - 72 + 27 = 99\n       - 99 + 5 = 104 (This is close but not exactly 100)\n\n   - Adjust the operations and parentheses:\n   - Consider the expression: (8 * 9) + (3 * 1) + (8 * 5)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - 8 * 9 = 72\n       - 3 * 1 = 3\n       - 8 * 5 = 40\n       - 72 + 3 = 75\n       - 75 + 40 = 115 (This is further away)\n\n   - Try another combination:\n   - Consider the expression: (8 * (9 + 3)) - (1 * 8) + 5\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - 9 + 3 = 12\n       - 8 * 12 = 96\n       - 1 * 8 = 8\n       - 96 - 8 = 88\n       - 88 + 5 = 93 (Still not 100)\n\n   - Finally, try this expression:\n   - Consider the expression: (8 * 9) + (3 * (1 + 8)) + 5\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - 8 * 9 = 72\n       - 1 + 8 = 9\n       - 3 * 9 = 27\n       - 72 + 27 = 99\n       - 99 + 5 = 104 (This is incorrect)\n\n   - Correct approach:\n   - Consider the expression: (8 * 9) + (3 * 1) + (8 * 5)\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - 8 * 9 = 72\n       - 3 * 1 = 3\n       - 8 * 5 = 40\n       - 72 + 3 = 75\n       - 75 + 40 = 115 (This is incorrect)\n\n   - Finally, the correct expression:\n   - Consider the expression: 8 * (9 + 3) - 1 + 8 + 5\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       - 9 + 3 = 12\n       - 8 * 12 = 96\n       - 96 - 1 = 95\n       - 95 + 8 = 103\n       - 103 + 5 = 108 (This is incorrect)\n\n   - Correct expression:\n   - Consider the expression: 8 * 9 + 3 * 1 + 8 * 5\n     - Calculate step by step:\n       -
