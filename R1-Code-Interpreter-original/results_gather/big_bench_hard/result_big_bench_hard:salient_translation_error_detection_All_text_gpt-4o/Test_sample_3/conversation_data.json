    "To analyze the translation error step by step, let's first break down the source sentence and the translation:\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**\n   - The source sentence in German is: \"Artemisia ist eine Pflanzengattung in der Familie der Korbblütler.\"\n   - Translation to English (literal): \"Artemisia is a genus of plants in the family of Asteraceae.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - The given translation is: \"Artemisia is a genus of plants in the family Artemisia.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Error:**\n   - The source sentence mentions \"Korbblütler,\" which is the German term for the plant family \"Asteraceae.\"\n   - The translation incorrectly states \"family Artemisia\" instead of \"family Asteraceae.\"\n\n4. **Error Classification:**\n   - The error involves the incorrect translation of a named entity.
