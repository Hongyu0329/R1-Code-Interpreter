    "To analyze the translation error step by step, let's first break down the source sentence and the translation:\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**\n   - \"Die FZ90 ist eine ungelenkte 70-mm-Luft-Boden-Rakete zum Einsatz an Flugzeugen und Hubschraubern.\"\n   - This translates to: \"The FZ90 is an unguided 70-mm air-to-surface missile for use on aircraft and helicopters.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - \"The FZ90 is an unguided 70 nm air-to-surface missile used on aircraft and helicopters.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Error:**\n   - Compare the source and translation:\n     - The source mentions \"70-mm\" (millimeters).\n     - The translation mentions \"70 nm\" (nanometers).\n\n4. **Error Type:**\n   - The error is in the numerical value and unit of measurement.\n   - \"mm\" (millimeters) is incorrectly translated as \"nm\" (nanometers).\n\n5. **Determine the Error Category:**\n   - This error falls under the category of \"Numerical Values\" because the unit of measurement has been changed from millimeters to nanometers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the translation error pertains to numerical values.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
