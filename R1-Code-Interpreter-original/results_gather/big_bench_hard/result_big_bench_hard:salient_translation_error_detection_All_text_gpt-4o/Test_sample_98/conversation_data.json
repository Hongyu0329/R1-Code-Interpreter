    "To analyze the translation error step by step, let's first break down the source sentence and the translation:\n\n1. **Source Sentence**: \"Die Talbrücke Steinatal ist eine 445 m lange Brücke der Autobahn 71.\"\n   - \"Die Talbrücke Steinatal\" translates to \"The Steinatal Valley Bridge.\"\n   - \"ist eine 445 m lange Brücke\" translates to \"is a 445 m long bridge.\"\n   - \"der Autobahn 71\" translates to \"on highway 71.\"\n\n2. **Translation**: \"The Steinatal Valley Bridge is a 45 m long bridge on highway 71.\"\n   - \"The Steinatal Valley Bridge\" correctly translates \"Die Talbrücke Steinatal.\"\n   - \"is a 45 m long bridge\" is the translation for \"ist eine 445 m lange Brücke.\"\n   - \"on highway 71\" correctly translates \"der Autobahn 71.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Error**:\n   - The source sentence states the bridge is \"445 m\" long.\n   - The translation states the bridge is \"45 m\" long.\n   - The numerical value \"445\" has been incorrectly translated as \"45.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Type of Error**:\n   - The error involves a change in the numerical value from \"445\" to \"45.\"\n   - This falls under the category of \"Numerical Values.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The error in the translation is related to the numerical value of the bridge's length.\n\nBased on the analysis, the translation contains an error pertaining to:\n\n<<<B>>>"
