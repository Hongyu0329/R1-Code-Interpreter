    "To analyze the translation error, let's break down the source sentence and the translation step by step:\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**\n   - The source sentence is in German: \"Die Liste der Registered Historic Places im Comal County führt alle Bauwerke und historischen Stätten im texanischen Comal County auf, die in das National Register of Historic Places aufgenommen wurden.\"\n   - This translates to: \"The list of Registered Historic Places in Comal County includes all buildings and historical sites in Comal County, Texas, that have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - The translation provided is: \"The Register ed. Historic Places in Comal County lists all buildings and historical sites in Texas, that have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.\"\n\n3. **Identifying the Error:**\n   - The key difference between the source and the translation is the location reference.\n   - The source specifies \"im texanischen Comal County\" which means \"in Comal County, Texas.\"\n   - The translation incorrectly states \"in Texas,\" which changes the scope from a specific county (Comal County) to the entire state of Texas.\n\n4. **Error Classification:**\n   - The error involves changing a specific location (Comal County) to a broader location (Texas).\n   - This falls under the category of \"Named Entities\" because the specific named entity (Comal County) is altered to a different entity (Texas).\n\nBased on the analysis, the translation error pertains to Named Entities.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>."
