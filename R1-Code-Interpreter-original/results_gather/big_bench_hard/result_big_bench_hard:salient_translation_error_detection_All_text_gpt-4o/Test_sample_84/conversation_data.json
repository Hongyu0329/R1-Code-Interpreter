    "To analyze the translation error step by step, let's break down the source and translation:\n\n1. **Source Analysis**:\n   - The source sentence is \"ist ein ehemaliger tschechischer Tennisspieler.\"\n   - Breaking it down:\n     - \"ist\" translates to \"is\"\n     - \"ein\" translates to \"a\"\n     - \"ehemaliger\" translates to \"former\"\n     - \"tschechischer\" translates to \"Czech\"\n     - \"Tennisspieler\" translates to \"tennis player\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The translation provided is \"is a former Czech soccer player.\"\n   - Breaking it down:\n     - \"is\" matches \"ist\"\n     - \"a\" matches \"ein\"\n     - \"former\" matches \"ehemaliger\"\n     - \"Czech\" matches \"tschechischer\"\n     - \"soccer player\" is the translation for \"Tennisspieler\"\n\n3. **Identifying the Error**:\n   - The translation error lies in the translation of \"Tennisspieler\" as \"soccer player.\"\n   - \"Tennisspieler\" should be translated as \"tennis player,\" not \"soccer player.\"\n\n4. **Error Classification**:\n   - The error involves changing a specific term related to a profession or activity.\n   - This falls under the category of \"Named Entities\" because the term \"Tennisspieler\" (tennis player) is a specific entity that was incorrectly translated to a different entity, \"soccer player.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the error in the translation pertains to Named Entities.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>."
