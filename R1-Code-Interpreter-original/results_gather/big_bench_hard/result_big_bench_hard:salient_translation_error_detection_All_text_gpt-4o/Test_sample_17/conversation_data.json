    "To analyze the translation error, let's break down the source sentence and the translation step by step:\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**\n   - \"Minnesota Point ist eine Insel und ehemalige Halbinsel an der M端ndung des Saint Louis River in den Oberen See.\"\n   - Translation: \"Minnesota Point is an island and former peninsula at the mouth of the Saint Louis River in the Upper Lake.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - \"Minnesota Point is an island and former peninsula at the mouth of the Saint Louis River.\"\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - The source mentions \"Minnesota Point\" as an \"Insel\" (island) and \"ehemalige Halbinsel\" (former peninsula).\n   - The translation correctly translates \"Insel\" as \"island\" and \"ehemalige Halbinsel\" as \"former peninsula.\"\n   - The source specifies the location as \"an der M端ndung des Saint Louis River in den Oberen See,\" which translates to \"at the mouth of the Saint Louis River in the Upper Lake.\"\n\n4. **Identifying the Error:**\n   - The translation omits \"in den Oberen See\" which means \"in the Upper Lake.\"\n   - This omission is a significant part of the sentence as it specifies the location of the mouth of the Saint Louis River.\n\n5. **Error Classification:**\n   - The error is due to the omission of a significant clause in the translation, which falls under the category of \"Dropped Content.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the error in the translation pertains to the omission of a significant clause, which is classified as \"Dropped Content.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<E>>>."
