    "To analyze the translation error, let's break down the source and translation step by step:\n\n1. **Source Analysis:**\n   - The source sentence in German mentions that Bonn was the seat of government of the Federal Republic of Germany from 1949 to 1999.\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - The translation states that Bonn was the seat of government from 1989 to 1999.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - The key difference between the source and the translation is the period during which Bonn was the seat of government. The source states \"1949 bis 1999,\" while the translation states \"1989 to 1999.\"\n\n4. **Error Identification:**\n   - The error is in the numerical values, specifically the starting year of the period during which Bonn was the seat of government. The source mentions 1949, but the translation incorrectly states 1989.\n\n5. **Error Type:**\n   - This error falls under the category of \"Numerical Values\" because it involves a change in the numerical representation of a date.\n\nBased on this analysis, the error in the translation pertains to numerical values.\n\nFinal answer: <<<B>>>."
