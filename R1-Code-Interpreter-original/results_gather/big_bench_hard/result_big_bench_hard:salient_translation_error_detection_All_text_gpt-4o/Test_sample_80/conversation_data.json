    "To analyze the translation error step by step, let's break down the source sentence and the translation:\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**\n   - \"Der Geierrabe\" translates to \"The Vulture Raven.\"\n   - \"ist eine Singvogelart\" translates to \"is a species of songbird.\"\n   - \"aus der Familie der Rabenvögel\" translates to \"from the family of corvids.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - \"The Vulture Raven\" is correctly translated from \"Der Geierrabe.\"\n   - \"is a species of bird\" is a partial translation of \"ist eine Singvogelart,\" but it omits the specific type of bird, which is a \"songbird.\"\n   - \"in the Columbine family\" is a mistranslation of \"aus der Familie der Rabenvögel.\" The correct translation should be \"from the family of corvids.\"\n\n3. **Error Identification:**\n   - The error lies in the translation of \"aus der Familie der Rabenvögel\" to \"in the Columbine family.\" The family \"Rabenvögel\" refers to \"corvids,\" not \"Columbine.\" This is a factual error regarding the classification of the bird family.\n\n4. **Error Type:**\n   - The error pertains to the category of \"Facts,\" as it involves a factual inaccuracy in the translation of the bird family.\n\nBased on the analysis, the translation error is a factual error.\n\nFinal answer: <<<F>>>."
