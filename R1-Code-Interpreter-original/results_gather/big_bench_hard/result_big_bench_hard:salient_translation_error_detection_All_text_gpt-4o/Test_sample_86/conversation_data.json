    "To analyze the translation error, let's break down the source and translated sentences:\n\n1. **Source Sentence**: \n   - \"Die Liste der Stolpersteine in Bochum enthält Stolpersteine, die im Rahmen des gleichnamigen Kunst-Projekts von Gunter Demnig in Bochum verlegt wurden.\"\n   - Translation: \"The list of stumbling blocks in Bochum contains stumbling blocks, which were laid as part of the art project of the same name by Gunter Demnig in Bochum.\"\n\n2. **Translated Sentence**: \n   - \"The list of stumbling blocks in Hokum contains stumbling blocks, which were laid as part of the art project of the same name by Hunter Demnig in Bochum.\"\n\n3. **Analysis of Errors**:\n   - **Named Entities**: \n     - \"Bochum\" is a city in Germany. In the translation, it is incorrectly translated as \"Hokum,\" which is not a correct representation of the original name.\n     - \"Gunter Demnig\" is the name of the artist. In the translation, it is incorrectly translated as \"Hunter Demnig,\" which changes the name of the person.\n   - **Numerical Values**: There are no numerical values in the sentence, so this is not applicable.\n   - **Modifiers or Adjectives**: There are no changes in modifiers or adjectives in the translation.\n   - **Negation or Antonyms**: There is no introduction or removal of negation or change to antonyms.\n   - **Facts**: The translation does not introduce any trivial factual errors.\n   - **Dropped Content**: The translation does not drop any significant content from the source.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The errors in the translation are related to the incorrect translation of named entities: \"Bochum\" to \"Hokum\" and \"Gunter Demnig\" to \"Hunter Demnig.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the translation error pertains to named entities.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>."
