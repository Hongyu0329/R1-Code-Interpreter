    "To analyze the translation error step by step, let's break down the source sentence and the translation:\n\n1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**\n   - \"Karl Borromäus Joseph Fürst von Liechtenstein\" is a name, where:\n     - \"Karl Borromäus Joseph\" is the person's full name.\n     - \"Fürst von Liechtenstein\" translates to \"Prince of Liechtenstein.\"\n   - \"war ein kaiserlicher Feldmarschall\" translates to \"was an imperial field marshal.\"\n\n2. **Translation Analysis:**\n   - \"Charles Borromeo Joseph Prince of Liechtenstein\" is the translated name, where:\n     - \"Charles Borromeo Joseph\" is used instead of \"Karl Borromäus Joseph.\"\n     - \"Prince of Liechtenstein\" is correctly translated.\n   - \"was an judicial field marshal\" is the translated role, where:\n     - \"judicial\" is used instead of \"imperial.\"\n\n3. **Identifying the Error:**\n   - The name \"Karl Borromäus Joseph\" is translated to \"Charles Borromeo Joseph,\" which is a change in the named entity. \"Karl\" is translated to \"Charles,\" and \"Borromäus\" is translated to \"Borromeo.\"\n   - The adjective \"kaiserlicher\" (imperial) is translated to \"judicial,\" which is incorrect.\n\n4. **Error Classification:**\n   - The change from \"Karl Borromäus Joseph\" to \"Charles Borromeo Joseph\" falls under the category of \"Named Entities\" because the names have been altered.\n   - The change from \"kaiserlicher\" to \"judicial\" falls under the category of \"Modifiers or Adjectives\" because the adjective describing the field marshal has been changed.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The translation contains an error in the named entities, as the names have been altered from the original German to English.\n\nTherefore, the translation error pertains to the category of Named Entities.\n\nFinal answer: <<<D>>>."
