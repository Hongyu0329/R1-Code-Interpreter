    "To analyze the translation error step by step, let's break down the source and translation:\n\n1. **Source Analysis**:\n   - The source text is \"Liste der Naturschutzgebiete im Landkreis Neu-Ulm\".\n   - This translates to \"List of nature reserves in the district of Neu-Ulm\" in English.\n\n2. **Translation Analysis**:\n   - The translation provided is \"List of nature reserves in the district of New-York\".\n\n3. **Identify the Error**:\n   - The key part of the source text is \"Landkreis Neu-Ulm\", which refers to a specific district in Germany.\n   - The translation changes \"Neu-Ulm\" to \"New-York\", which is a completely different location and not a district in Germany.\n\n4. **Error Type**:\n   - The error involves changing a specific named entity (\"Neu-Ulm\") to another named entity (\"New-York\").\n   - This falls under the category of \"Named Entities\" as the name of a place has been incorrectly translated to a different place.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The error in the translation is related to the incorrect translation of a named entity.\n\nBased on the analysis, the error type is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
