  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nA group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. The students did not cheat on the test. One student, John Granger, went along with the group. Granger follows the local norm and does not cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Granger caused the pre-med student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff, we need to analyze the situation in terms of causation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Scenario**: \n   - Granger scored the 20th highest in the class, securing the last A grade.\n   - The pre-med student scored 21st, receiving a B grade.\n   - The grading is done on a curve, meaning only the top 20 scores receive an A.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Direct Causation**: For Granger to have directly caused the pre-med student to miss the cutoff, his actions or score would need to have a direct impact on the pre-med student's score or grade. In this case, Granger's score did not change the pre-med student's score; it only affected the distribution of grades due to the curve.\n   - **Counterfactual Analysis**: If Granger had scored lower, the pre-med student would have been in the top 20 and received an A. However, this is a hypothetical scenario and does not imply direct causation.\n   - **Responsibility and Norms**: Granger followed the local norm and did not cheat. His actions were within the rules, and he did not actively do anything to harm the pre-med student's chances.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Granger's score indirectly affected the pre-med student's grade due to the grading curve, but he did not cause her to miss the cutoff in a direct or intentional manner. The grading system and the distribution of scores are the primary factors.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to whether Granger caused the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
