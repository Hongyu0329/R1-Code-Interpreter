  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Alice caused the empty email to be sent, we need to analyze the situation based on the concept of causation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation:**\n   - The company policy is that Alice logs in during the morning and Zoe logs in during the afternoon.\n   - Zoe violated the policy by logging in at 9 am.\n   - Alice followed the policy by logging in at 9:30 am.\n   - The system sends an empty email if two people are logged in simultaneously.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - For causation, we typically look for a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n   - Zoe's login at 9 am was the first action that violated the policy.\n   - Alice's login at 9:30 am, while following the policy, was the second action that led to both being logged in simultaneously.\n   - The simultaneous login of both Alice and Zoe triggered the email.\n\n3. **Evaluating Alice's Role:**\n   - Alice's login was a necessary condition for the email to be sent because it was her login that resulted in both being logged in at the same time.\n   - However, Alice was following the policy, and Zoe's prior login was the initial violation.\n   - If Zoe had not logged in, Alice's login would not have caused the email to be sent.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - While Alice's login was a necessary condition for the email to be sent, the primary cause was Zoe's initial violation of the policy.\n   - In terms of responsibility and causation, Zoe's action is the root cause.\n\nBased on this reasoning, a typical person might conclude that Alice did not cause the email to be sent because she was following the policy, and the situation was initiated by Zoe's violation.\n\n<<<No>>>"
