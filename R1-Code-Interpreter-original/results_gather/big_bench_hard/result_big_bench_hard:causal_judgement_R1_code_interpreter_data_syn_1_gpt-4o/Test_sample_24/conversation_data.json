  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Janet noticed that she did not put oil in the machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down, we need to analyze the situation based on the concept of causation.\n\n1. **Responsibility and Knowledge**: Janet is responsible for oiling the machines, and she knows how to do it. Kate also knows how to oil the machines but is not responsible for doing so.\n\n2. **Event Sequence**: Janet forgot to put oil in the machine, and as a result, the machine broke down a few days later. Kate did not notice the lack of oil and did not intervene.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**: \n   - **Direct Cause**: Janet's failure to oil the machine is a direct cause of the machine breaking down because it was her responsibility, and she had the knowledge to perform the task.\n   - **Counterfactual Test**: If Janet had oiled the machine, it likely would not have broken down. This supports the idea that her inaction was a cause of the breakdown.\n   - **Responsibility**: Since it was Janet's responsibility to oil the machine, her failure to do so directly links her action (or inaction) to the machine's breakdown.\n\nBased on this reasoning, a typical person would likely conclude that Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
