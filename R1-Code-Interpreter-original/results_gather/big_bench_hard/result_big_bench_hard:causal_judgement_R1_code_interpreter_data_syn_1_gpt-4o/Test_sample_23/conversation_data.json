    "To determine whether the board intentionally helped the environment, we need to consider the concept of intentionality in causation. Intentionality involves a deliberate action taken with a specific goal in mind. In this scenario, the board's primary and stated intention was to increase profits, not to help the environment. The fact that the program also helped the environment was incidental to the board's decision-making process.\n\nThe board's decision was based solely on the potential for increased profits, as evidenced by their explicit statement, \"We don't care at all about helping the environment. We just want to make as much profit as we can.\" Therefore, any positive environmental impact was not a result of the board's intention but rather a byproduct of their profit-driven decision.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the board did not intentionally help the environment because their actions were not motivated by a desire to achieve that outcome. The environmental benefit was an unintended consequence of their decision to pursue profit.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
