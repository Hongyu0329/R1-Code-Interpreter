  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nAlice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Zoe caused the empty email to be sent, we need to analyze the situation based on the concept of causation. In this scenario, the causation is related to the simultaneous login of two people into the central computer, which triggers the sending of an empty email.\n\n1. **Understanding the Policy and Actions:**\n   - The company policy states that Alice is the only one allowed to log in during the mornings.\n   - Zoe violated this policy by logging in at 9 am, which is considered morning.\n   - Alice also logged in at 9 am, which is within her permitted time according to the policy.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis:**\n   - The sending of the empty email is triggered by the simultaneous login of two people.\n   - If Zoe had not logged in, Alice's login alone would not have caused the email to be sent.\n   - Therefore, Zoe's action of logging in at the same time as Alice is a necessary condition for the email to be sent.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Zoe's login was a necessary condition for the email to be sent, and she violated the policy by logging in during the morning, it can be concluded that Zoe did cause the empty email to be sent.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
