  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nMr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the crime life cause Mr. Wallace's death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the crime life caused Mr. Wallace's death, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the potential causes of his death.\n\n1. **Poisoning**: Mr. Vincent poisoned Mr. Wallace's drink with a lethal dose of poison. The poison takes about an hour to kill, with a variance of 10 minutes depending on body weight. Mr. Wallace consumed the poison and left the restaurant shortly after.\n\n2. **Car Accident**: Mr. Wallace was followed by Mr. Bruce, who drove a van that rammed into Mr. Wallace's car, causing it to fall into a ravine and explode. The coroner's report indicated that Mr. Wallace died from fatal burns in the car explosion.\n\n3. **Timing**: The poison would have taken effect approximately an hour after consumption. If Mr. Wallace left the restaurant and was involved in the car accident within this timeframe, the poison may not have had time to kill him before the car explosion.\n\n4. **Coroner's Report**: The report confirmed that Mr. Wallace died from burns in the car explosion, but also found a lethal dose of poison in his blood. This suggests that while the poison was present, it was the car explosion that directly caused his death.\n\nGiven these points, the crime life, represented by both the poisoning and the car attack, contributed to the circumstances leading to Mr. Wallace's death. However, the immediate cause of death was the car explosion orchestrated by Mr. Bruce.\n\nTherefore, the crime life, involving both the poisoning and the car attack, can be seen as the cause of Mr. Wallace's death, as both events were orchestrated by individuals involved in organized crime.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
