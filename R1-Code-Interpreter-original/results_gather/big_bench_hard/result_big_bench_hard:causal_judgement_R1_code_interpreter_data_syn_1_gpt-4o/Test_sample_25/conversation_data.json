  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in the factory. She works in the maintenance department where she monitors the stability of all machines. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee in the factory. She works in the human resources department where she monitors the salaries of all employees. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. On June 1st, Janet forgot to put oil into the machine. The machine broke down. Did the machine break down because Kate did not put oil in the machine?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether the machine broke down because Kate did not put oil in the machine, we need to analyze the causal relationship and responsibilities described in the scenario.\n\n1. **Janet's Responsibility**: Janet is responsible for putting oil into the machines as part of her role in the maintenance department. It is explicitly stated that it is her responsibility to ensure the machines are oiled.\n\n2. **Kate's Role**: Kate works in the human resources department and, although she knows how to grease and oil the machines, it is not her responsibility to do so. The scenario clearly states that if Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to take over this task.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**: The machine broke down because Janet forgot to put oil in it. The breakdown is directly linked to Janet's failure to perform her duty. Kate's inaction is not a cause of the breakdown because it was never her responsibility to oil the machines.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the machine did not break down because Kate did not put oil in the machine. The breakdown was due to Janet's oversight.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
