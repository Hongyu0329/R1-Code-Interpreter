  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down, we need to analyze the situation using the concept of causation.\n\n1. **Identify the Cause and Effect**: \n   - Cause: Janet did not put oil in the machine.\n   - Effect: The machine broke down a few days later.\n\n2. **Analyze the Responsibility**:\n   - Janet is responsible for oiling the machines. It is explicitly stated that it is her responsibility to put oil into the machines.\n   - Kate, although she knows how to oil the machines, is not responsible for doing so if Janet fails to.\n\n3. **Consider the Counterfactual**:\n   - If Janet had put oil in the machine, would the machine have broken down? Given the information, it is likely that the machine would not have broken down if it had been properly oiled.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Causal Link**:\n   - Since Janet's action (or inaction) directly relates to her responsibility and the subsequent breakdown of the machine, there is a strong causal link between her not oiling the machine and the machine breaking down.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, Janet not putting oil in the machine is a direct cause of the machine breaking down because it was her responsibility, and her failure to act led to the negative outcome.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
