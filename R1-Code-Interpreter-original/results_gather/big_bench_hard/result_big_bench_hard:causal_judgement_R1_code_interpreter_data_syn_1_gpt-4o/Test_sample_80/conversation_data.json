  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in the factory. She works in the maintenance department where she monitors the stability of all machines. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee in the factory. She works in the human resources department where she monitors the salaries of all employees. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is Kate's responsibility to do so. On June 1st, Janet forgot to put oil into the machine. The machine broke down. Did the machine break down because Kate did not put oil in the machine?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the machine broke down because Kate did not put oil in the machine, we need to analyze the causal chain of events and responsibilities.\n\n1. **Janet's Responsibility**: Janet is primarily responsible for putting oil into the machines. On June 1st, she forgot to do so.\n\n2. **Kate's Responsibility**: Kate is responsible for putting oil in the machines only if Janet does not do it. This implies a backup or secondary responsibility.\n\n3. **Causal Chain**: The machine broke down because it was not oiled. The primary cause of the machine breaking down is Janet's failure to oil the machine. Kate's responsibility is contingent upon Janet's failure, but the primary failure lies with Janet.\n\n4. **Causation Analysis**: In terms of causation, the machine broke down because the primary responsible person (Janet) did not perform her duty. Kate's inaction is a secondary factor, and the primary cause of the breakdown is Janet's omission.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the typical answer to the question of whether the machine broke down because Kate did not put oil in the machine would be:\n\n- **No**, because the primary responsibility was Janet's, and her failure to act is the direct cause of the breakdown.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in the factory.
