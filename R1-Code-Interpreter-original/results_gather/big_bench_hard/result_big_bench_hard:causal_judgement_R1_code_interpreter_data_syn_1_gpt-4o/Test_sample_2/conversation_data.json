  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLong ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the misadministration of medication caused John's premature death, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the concept of causation.\n\n1. **John's Health Condition**: John had a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer, with doctors estimating he had no more than 2 months to live. This indicates that his death was imminent due to his cancer.\n\n2. **Event of Medication Misadministration**: A nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication, to which John was allergic, causing him to go into shock and experience cardiac arrest, leading to his death.\n\n3. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **But-for Test**: Would John have died at the same time if the medication had not been misadministered? Given his terminal condition, he was expected to die soon, but the medication error directly led to his immediate death.\n   - **Proximate Cause**: The medication error was a direct and immediate cause of his death, even though he was already terminally ill.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While John's death was inevitable due to his cancer, the misadministration of medication was the immediate cause of his death at that specific time. Therefore, in terms of causation, the medication error did cause his premature death.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
