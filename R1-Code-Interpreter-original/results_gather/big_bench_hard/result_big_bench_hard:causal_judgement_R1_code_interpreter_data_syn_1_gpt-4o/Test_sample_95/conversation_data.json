  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Jane logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Lauren decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Jane caused the computer to crash, we need to analyze the situation based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Scenario**: \n   - The computer crashes if two people are logged on at the same time.\n   - The company policy allows Jane to use the computer in the morning and Lauren in the afternoon.\n   - Jane logged on at 9:00 am, which is within her permitted time.\n   - Lauren also logged on at 9:00 am, which is against the policy.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - For Jane to be the cause of the crash, her action alone should be sufficient to cause the crash.\n   - However, the computer crashes only when both Jane and Lauren are logged on simultaneously.\n   - Jane logging on alone does not cause the crash; it is the simultaneous action of both Jane and Lauren logging on that causes the crash.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Jane was following the policy and her logging on alone does not cause the crash, she is not the cause of the crash.\n   - The crash was caused by the combination of both Jane and Lauren being logged on at the same time, with Lauren's action being against the policy.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to whether Jane caused the computer to crash is:\n\n<<<No>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nLauren and Jane work for the same company.
