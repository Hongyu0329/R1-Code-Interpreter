  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJoe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the neighbor cause injury to Joe's son?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the neighbor caused the injury to Joe's son, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the concept of causation.\n\n1. **Sequence of Events**: \n   - Joe was delayed because he was talking to friends.\n   - The neighbor, after waiting for 15 minutes, decided to take Joe's son home.\n   - On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver.\n   - Joe's son was injured in the accident.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - **Direct Cause**: The direct cause of the injury was the car accident caused by the drunk driver. The neighbor was not responsible for the accident itself.\n   - **Proximate Cause**: The neighbor's decision to take Joe's son home was a proximate cause in the sense that it placed the child in the situation where the accident occurred. However, the neighbor's action was not the cause of the accident.\n   - **Responsibility**: The neighbor acted with the intention of helping by taking Joe's son home. There was no negligence or wrongful act on the neighbor's part that directly led to the injury.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The neighbor did not cause the injury in the sense of being responsible for the accident. The injury was caused by the drunk driver, who was the direct and primary cause of the accident.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question of whether the neighbor caused the injury to Joe's son is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
