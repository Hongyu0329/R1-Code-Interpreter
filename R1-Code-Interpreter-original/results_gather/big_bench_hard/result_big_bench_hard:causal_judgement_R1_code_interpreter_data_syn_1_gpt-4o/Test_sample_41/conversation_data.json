  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJoe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the drunk driver cause injury to Joe's son?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the drunk driver caused injury to Joe's son, we need to analyze the causal chain of events and the concept of causation in this context.\n\n1. **Event Sequence**: \n   - Joe was delayed because he was talking to friends.\n   - Joe's neighbor decided to take Joe's son home due to the delay.\n   - On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver.\n   - Joe's son was injured in the accident.\n\n2. **Causation Analysis**:\n   - The direct cause of the injury is the car accident caused by the drunk driver. The drunk driver's actions directly led to the collision, which resulted in the injury.\n   - Joe's talkativeness and the subsequent delay are indirect factors. They set the stage for the neighbor to take Joe's son home, but they did not directly cause the injury.\n   - In legal and philosophical terms, causation often distinguishes between direct causes and contributing factors. The drunk driver's actions are the proximate cause of the injury.\n\n3. **Typical Person's Perspective**:\n   - A typical person would likely focus on the immediate cause of the injury, which is the car accident caused by the drunk driver. While Joe's actions contributed to the situation, they are not the direct cause of the injury.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the typical answer to the question of whether the drunk driver caused the injury would be:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
