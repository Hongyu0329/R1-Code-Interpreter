  "question": "How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?\nJanet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate did not notice that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Janet not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- No\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down, we need to analyze the situation using the concept of causation. Causation implies that one event (the cause) directly leads to another event (the effect). In this scenario, we need to assess whether Janet's action (or inaction) directly led to the machine breaking down.\n\n1. **Responsibility and Knowledge**: Janet is responsible for oiling the machines, and she knows how to do it. Kate also knows how to oil the machines but is not responsible for doing so if Janet forgets.\n\n2. **Event Sequence**: Janet forgot to put oil in the machine, and subsequently, the machine broke down a few days later.\n\n3. **Causal Link**: The lack of oiling is a plausible cause for the machine's breakdown, especially if regular oiling is necessary for the machine's proper functioning.\n\n4. **Counterfactual Consideration**: If Janet had put oil in the machine, it is likely that the machine would not have broken down. This suggests a causal relationship between Janet's inaction and the machine's failure.\n\n5. **Responsibility and Causation**: Since it was Janet's responsibility to oil the machine and she failed to do so, her inaction can be seen as the cause of the breakdown.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question of whether Janet not putting oil in the machine caused it to break down is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
