    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the fourth position from the left.\n\n2. **The hawk is to the right of the falcon.**\n   - This implies that the falcon is somewhere to the left of the hawk.\n\n3. **The raven is the second from the left.**\n   - This places the raven in the second position from the left.\n\n4. **The crow is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the crow is in the fifth position from the left.\n\nNow, let's use these clues to determine the positions of all the birds:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it occupies the fifth position.\n- The cardinal is the second from the right, so it occupies the fourth position.\n- The raven is the second from the left, so it occupies the second position.\n\nThis leaves the first and third positions for the falcon and the hawk. Since the hawk is to the right of the falcon, the falcon must be in the first position, and the hawk must be in the third position.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is:\n1. Falcon\n2. Raven\n3. Hawk\n4. Cardinal\n5. Crow\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The falcon is the leftmost - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(B) The raven is the leftmost - This is false; the raven is second from the left.\n(C) The cardinal is the leftmost - This is false; the cardinal is second from the right.\n(D) The hawk is the leftmost - This is false; the hawk is in the third position.\n(E) The crow is the leftmost - This is false; the crow is the rightmost.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
