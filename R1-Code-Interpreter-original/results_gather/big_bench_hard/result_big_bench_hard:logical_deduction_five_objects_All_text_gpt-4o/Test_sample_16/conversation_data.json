    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The tractor is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is older than the tractor.\n\n2. **The limousine is the second-newest.**\n   - This places the limousine in the fourth position from the oldest.\n\n3. **The truck is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the truck is older than both the hatchback and the tractor.\n\n4. **The convertible is the second-oldest.**\n   - This places the convertible in the second position from the oldest.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it occupies the second position.\n- The limousine is the second-newest, so it occupies the fourth position.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, and the hatchback is older than the tractor. Therefore, the truck must be the oldest, the hatchback is in the third position, and the tractor is the newest.\n\nArranging them from oldest to newest, we have:\n1. Truck\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Limousine\n5. Tractor\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n- (A) The hatchback is the second-oldest: Incorrect, the hatchback is third.\n- (B) The convertible is the second-oldest: Correct, as per our arrangement.\n- (C) The tractor is the second-oldest: Incorrect, the tractor is the newest.\n- (D) The truck is the second-oldest: Incorrect, the truck is the oldest.\n- (E) The limousine is the second-oldest: Incorrect, the limousine is fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
