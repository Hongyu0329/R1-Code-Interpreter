    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Ada finished above Eli.**\n   - This means Ada's position is better (numerically lower) than Eli's.\n\n2. **Amy finished below Mel.**\n   - This means Amy's position is worse (numerically higher) than Mel's.\n\n3. **Ada finished second.**\n   - This directly places Ada in the second position.\n\n4. **Mel finished below Eli.**\n   - This means Mel's position is worse (numerically higher) than Eli's.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place each golfer in their respective positions:\n\n- Since Ada is second, we have: \n  - Position 2: Ada\n\n- Ada finished above Eli, so Eli cannot be first. Eli must be third or lower.\n\n- Mel finished below Eli, so Mel cannot be third. Mel must be fourth or fifth.\n\n- Amy finished below Mel, so Amy must be fifth.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining golfers:\n\n- Since Ada is second, and Eli cannot be first, Eli must be third.\n\n- Mel, who is below Eli, must be fourth.\n\n- Amy, who is below Mel, must be fifth.\n\nThis leaves the first position for Joe, as he is the only golfer not yet placed.\n\nThus, the order is:\n1. Joe\n2. Ada\n3. Eli\n4. Mel\n5. Amy\n\nTherefore, the golfer who finished first is Joe.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
