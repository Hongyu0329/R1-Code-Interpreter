    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given statements:\n\n1. The plums are less expensive than the kiwis.\n2. The plums are more expensive than the watermelons.\n3. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n4. The oranges are the most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- From statement 4, we know that oranges are the most expensive. So, oranges are at the top of the list.\n\n- From statement 1, plums are less expensive than kiwis. This means kiwis are more expensive than plums.\n\n- From statement 2, plums are more expensive than watermelons. This means watermelons are less expensive than plums.\n\n- From statement 3, loquats are more expensive than kiwis. This means loquats are above kiwis in the price order.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since oranges are the most expensive, they are at the top.\n- Loquats are more expensive than kiwis, so loquats are above kiwis.\n- Kiwis are more expensive than plums, so kiwis are above plums.\n- Plums are more expensive than watermelons, so plums are above watermelons.\n\nPutting it all together, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n\n1. Watermelons\n2. Plums\n3. Kiwis\n4. Loquats\n5. Oranges\n\nFrom this order, we can see that watermelons are the cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
