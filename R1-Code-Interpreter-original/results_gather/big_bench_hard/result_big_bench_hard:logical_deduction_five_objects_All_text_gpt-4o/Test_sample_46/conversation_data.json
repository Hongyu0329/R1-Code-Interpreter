    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The quail is to the left of the blue jay.**\n   - This means the quail is positioned somewhere before the blue jay.\n\n2. **The cardinal is the third from the left.**\n   - This fixes the position of the cardinal as the third bird in the sequence.\n\n3. **The quail is the second from the left.**\n   - This fixes the position of the quail as the second bird in the sequence.\n\n4. **The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the blue jay is positioned somewhere before the hummingbird.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the order:\n\n- The cardinal is fixed as the third bird.\n- The quail is fixed as the second bird.\n- The blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird, and since the quail is second, the blue jay cannot be first. Therefore, the blue jay must be fourth.\n- The hummingbird must be to the right of the blue jay, so it must be fifth.\n- The only position left for the hawk is the first position.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: Hawk, Quail, Cardinal, Blue Jay, Hummingbird.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The blue jay is the second from the left - Incorrect, the blue jay is fourth.\n(B) The cardinal is the second from the left - Incorrect, the cardinal is third.\n(C) The hawk is the second from the left - Incorrect, the hawk is first.\n(D) The hummingbird is the second from the left - Incorrect, the hummingbird is fifth.\n(E) The quail is the second from the left - Correct, the quail is indeed second.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
