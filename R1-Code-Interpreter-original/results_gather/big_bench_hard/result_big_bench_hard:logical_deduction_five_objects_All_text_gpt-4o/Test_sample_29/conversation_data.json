    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Mel finished first.**\n   - This means Mel is in the 1st position.\n\n2. **Amy finished below Dan.**\n   - This implies that Dan finished in a higher position than Amy.\n\n3. **Joe finished above Dan.**\n   - This means Joe is in a higher position than Dan.\n\n4. **Eve finished last.**\n   - Eve is in the 5th position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the possible order:\n\n- Since Mel is 1st and Eve is 5th, the positions 2nd, 3rd, and 4th are left for Dan, Amy, and Joe.\n- Joe must be above Dan, so Joe cannot be 4th.\n- Amy must be below Dan, so Amy cannot be 2nd or 3rd.\n\nLet's try to place Joe, Dan, and Amy in the remaining positions:\n\n- If Joe is 2nd, then Dan can be 3rd, and Amy can be 4th. This satisfies all conditions:\n  - Joe is above Dan.\n  - Dan is above Amy.\n  - Mel is 1st, Joe is 2nd, Dan is 3rd, Amy is 4th, and Eve is 5th.\n\nThis order satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, Joe finished second.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
