On a branch, there are five birds: a cardinal, a robin, a blue jay, a quail, and a raven. The robin is to the right of the raven. The cardinal is the leftmost. The raven is to the right of the blue jay. The blue jay is the third from the left.\nOptions:\n(A) The cardinal is the leftmost\n(B) The robin is the leftmost\n(C) The blue jay is the leftmost\n(D) The quail is the leftmost\n(E) The raven is the leftmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the first position.\n\n2. **The robin is to the right of the raven.**\n   - This means the raven must be positioned to the left of the robin.\n\n3. **The raven is to the right of the blue jay.**\n   - This means the blue jay must be positioned to the left of the raven.\n\n4. **The blue jay is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the blue jay is in the third position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the positions:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n- The blue jay is third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n- The raven must be to the right of the blue jay, so it cannot be in position 2. It must be in position 4 or 5.\n- The robin is to the right of the raven, so the raven cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the raven is in position 4.\n- Consequently, the robin must be in position 5.\n- The only remaining position is 2, which must be occupied by the quail.\n\nThe final order from left to right is: Cardinal, Quail, Blue Jay, Raven, Robin.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The cardinal is the leftmost: This is consistent with our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
