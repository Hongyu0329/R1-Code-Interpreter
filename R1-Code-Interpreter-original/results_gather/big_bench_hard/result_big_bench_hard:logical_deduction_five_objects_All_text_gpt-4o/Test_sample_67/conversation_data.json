    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions and then identify which bird is second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1**: The owl is the second from the right.\n   - This means the owl is in the fourth position from the left.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: The robin is the second from the left.\n   - This means the robin is in the second position from the left.\n\n3. **Condition 3**: The robin is to the right of the blue jay.\n   - Since the robin is in the second position, the blue jay must be in the first position.\n\n4. **Condition 4**: The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n   - This means the hawk must be to the left of the hummingbird.\n\nNow, let's place the birds in order based on these conditions:\n\n- The blue jay is in the first position.\n- The robin is in the second position.\n- The owl is in the fourth position.\n\nThis leaves the third and fifth positions for the hawk and the hummingbird. Since the hummingbird must be to the right of the hawk, the hawk must be in the third position and the hummingbird in the fifth position.\n\nThus, the order of the birds from left to right is:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Owl\n5. Hummingbird\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is second from the right. The second from the right is the fourth position, which is occupied by the owl.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
