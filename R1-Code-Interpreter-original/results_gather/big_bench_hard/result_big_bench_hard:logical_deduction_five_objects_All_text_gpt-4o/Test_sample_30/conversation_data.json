    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The quail is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the quail is in the first position.\n\n2. **The robin is the second from the left.**\n   - This places the robin in the second position.\n\n3. **The hawk is the third from the left.**\n   - This places the hawk in the third position.\n\n4. **The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the blue jay must be placed before the hummingbird in the order.\n\nNow, let's place the birds in order based on these conditions:\n\n- Position 1: Quail\n- Position 2: Robin\n- Position 3: Hawk\n\nThe remaining two positions (4 and 5) must be filled by the blue jay and the hummingbird. Since the blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird, the blue jay must be in position 4, and the hummingbird must be in position 5.\n\nThus, the order of the birds from left to right is:\n1. Quail\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options to determine which bird is the rightmost:\n\n(A) The quail is the rightmost - Incorrect, the quail is the leftmost.\n(B) The hummingbird is the rightmost - Correct, the hummingbird is in position 5.\n(C) The blue jay is the rightmost - Incorrect, the blue jay is in position 4.\n(D) The hawk is the rightmost - Incorrect, the hawk is in position 3.\n(E) The robin is the rightmost - Incorrect, the robin is in position 2.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
