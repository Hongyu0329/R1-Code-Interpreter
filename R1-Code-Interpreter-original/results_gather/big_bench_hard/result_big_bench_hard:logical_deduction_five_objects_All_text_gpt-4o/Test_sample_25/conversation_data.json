    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints in the paragraph. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the most expensive fruit:**\n   - The watermelons are the most expensive.\n\n2. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - The plums are the second-most expensive.\n\n3. **Identify the second-cheapest fruit:**\n   - The pears are the second-cheapest.\n\n4. **Determine the relative position of loquats:**\n   - The loquats are more expensive than the pears. Since the pears are the second-cheapest, the loquats must be either the third-most expensive or the fourth-most expensive.\n\n5. **Determine the position of apples:**\n   - The apples are not mentioned in the constraints, so they could be either the cheapest or the third-most expensive, depending on the position of the loquats.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on the above analysis:\n\n- **Most expensive:** Watermelons\n- **Second-most expensive:** Plums\n- **Second-cheapest:** Pears\n\nSince the loquats are more expensive than the pears, they cannot be the cheapest. Therefore, the loquats must be the third-most expensive, and the apples must be the cheapest.\n\nThus, the order from most expensive to cheapest is:\n1. Watermelons\n2. Plums\n3. Loquats\n4. Pears\n5. Apples\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The watermelons are the third-most expensive: Incorrect, they are the most expensive.\n- (B) The loquats are the third-most expensive: Correct, as per our arrangement.\n- (C) The pears are the third-most expensive: Incorrect, they are the fourth-most expensive.\n- (D) The plums are the third-most expensive: Incorrect, they are the second-most expensive.\n- (E) The apples are the third-most expensive: Incorrect, they are the cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
