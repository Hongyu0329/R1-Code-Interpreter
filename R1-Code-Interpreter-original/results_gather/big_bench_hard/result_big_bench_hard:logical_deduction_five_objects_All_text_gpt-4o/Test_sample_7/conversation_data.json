    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Ada finished above Mel.**\n   - This means Ada's position is better (lower number) than Mel's position.\n\n2. **Mel finished above Dan.**\n   - This means Mel's position is better than Dan's position.\n\n3. **Joe finished below Dan.**\n   - This means Joe's position is worse (higher number) than Dan's position.\n\n4. **Ada finished second.**\n   - This gives us a fixed position for Ada: she is in 2nd place.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the positions of the other golfers:\n\n- Since Ada is 2nd, and she finished above Mel, Mel cannot be 1st or 2nd. Therefore, Mel must be 3rd or lower.\n- Mel finished above Dan, so Dan cannot be 3rd. Therefore, Dan must be 4th or 5th.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe must be 5th if Dan is 4th.\n\nLet's try to place the golfers:\n\n- Ada is 2nd.\n- Mel must be 3rd because he is above Dan and below Ada.\n- Dan must be 4th because he is above Joe.\n- Joe must be 5th because he is below Dan.\n\nThis leaves only the 1st position for Rob, as all other positions are filled.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Rob\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) Rob finished last - Incorrect, Rob finished 1st.\n(B) Ada finished last - Incorrect, Ada finished 2nd.\n(C) Dan finished last - Incorrect, Dan finished 4th.\n(D) Joe finished last - Correct, Joe finished 5th.\n(E) Mel finished last - Incorrect, Mel finished 3rd.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
