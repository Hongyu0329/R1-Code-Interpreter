    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The gray book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book cannot be the rightmost book.\n\n2. **The green book is the second from the right.**\n   - This fixes the position of the green book as the fourth book from the left.\n\n3. **The brown book is to the right of the white book.**\n   - This means the white book cannot be the rightmost book.\n\n4. **The brown book is to the left of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book cannot be the leftmost book.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the green book is the second from the right, the positions are:\n  - _ _ _ Green _\n\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, and the brown book is to the left of the orange book. Therefore, the orange book cannot be in the rightmost position, and the gray book must be the rightmost book:\n  - _ _ _ Green Gray\n\n- The brown book is to the right of the white book, and to the left of the orange book. Therefore, the order of the first three books must be:\n  - White Brown Orange Green Gray\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The white book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the white book is the leftmost.\n(B) The green book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the green book is second from the right.\n(C) The brown book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the brown book is in the middle.\n(D) The gray book is the rightmost - Correct, as the gray book is the rightmost.\n(E) The orange book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the orange book is in the middle.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
