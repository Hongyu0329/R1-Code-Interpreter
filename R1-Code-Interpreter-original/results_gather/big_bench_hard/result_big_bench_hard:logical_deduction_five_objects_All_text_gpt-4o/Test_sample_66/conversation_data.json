    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **The minivan is older than the sedan.**\n   - This means the minivan is not the newest, and the sedan is not the oldest.\n\n2. **The tractor is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the tractor is not the newest, and the hatchback is not the oldest.\n\n3. **The minivan is the third-newest.**\n   - This means there are two vehicles newer than the minivan and two vehicles older than the minivan.\n\n4. **The station wagon is the second-newest.**\n   - This means there is one vehicle newer than the station wagon and three vehicles older than the station wagon.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the order:\n\n- Since the station wagon is the second-newest, it must be newer than the minivan. Therefore, the minivan cannot be the second-newest, confirming it is the third-newest.\n- The only vehicle that can be newer than the station wagon is the sedan, as the minivan is the third-newest.\n- Therefore, the order from newest to oldest is: Sedan (newest), Station Wagon, Minivan, and then two older vehicles.\n- The tractor is older than the hatchback, so the hatchback is newer than the tractor.\n\nThus, the complete order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Tractor (oldest)\n2. Hatchback\n3. Minivan\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Sedan (newest)\n\nNow, we can determine which vehicle is the oldest:\n- The tractor is the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
