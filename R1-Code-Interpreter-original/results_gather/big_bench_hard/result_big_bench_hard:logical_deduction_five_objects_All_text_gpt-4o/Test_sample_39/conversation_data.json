    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the owl.\n2. The hummingbird is to the right of the cardinal.\n3. The crow is to the left of the robin.\n4. The owl is to the left of the crow.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Hummingbird (H) is to the left of Owl (O).\n- From condition 2, we know: Cardinal (C) is to the left of Hummingbird (H).\n- From condition 3, we know: Crow (Cr) is to the left of Robin (R).\n- From condition 4, we know: Owl (O) is to the left of Crow (Cr).\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the hummingbird is to the left of the owl and to the right of the cardinal, the order must be: Cardinal (C), Hummingbird (H), Owl (O).\n- The owl is to the left of the crow, so the order becomes: Cardinal (C), Hummingbird (H), Owl (O), Crow (Cr).\n- The crow is to the left of the robin, so the final order is: Cardinal (C), Hummingbird (H), Owl (O), Crow (Cr), Robin (R).\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which bird is second from the left:\n\n- The order is: Cardinal (C), Hummingbird (H), Owl (O), Crow (Cr), Robin (R).\n- The second bird from the left is the Hummingbird (H).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
