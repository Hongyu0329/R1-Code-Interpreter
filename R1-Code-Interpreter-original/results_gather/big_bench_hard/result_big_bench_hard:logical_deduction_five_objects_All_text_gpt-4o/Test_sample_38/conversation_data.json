    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Mya finished first.**\n   - This means Mya is in the 1st position.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Dan.**\n   - This implies that Joe's position number is greater than Dan's position number.\n\n3. **Dan finished below Rob.**\n   - This implies that Dan's position number is greater than Rob's position number.\n\n4. **Eve finished above Rob.**\n   - This implies that Eve's position number is less than Rob's position number.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order:\n\n- Since Mya is 1st, the remaining positions (2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th) are to be filled by Joe, Eve, Rob, and Dan.\n\n- From condition 4, Eve is above Rob, so Eve cannot be 4th or 5th. Therefore, Eve must be 2nd or 3rd.\n\n- From condition 3, Dan is below Rob, so Dan cannot be 2nd or 3rd. Therefore, Dan must be 4th or 5th.\n\n- From condition 2, Joe is below Dan, so Joe cannot be 4th. Therefore, Joe must be 5th.\n\n- Since Joe is 5th, Dan must be 4th (as Dan is above Joe).\n\n- Now, Rob must be 3rd because Dan is below Rob and Eve is above Rob.\n\n- Finally, Eve must be 2nd because she is above Rob.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Mya\n2. Eve\n3. Rob\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Who finished third?\" is Rob.\n\nThe correct option is (D) Rob finished third.\n\n<<<D>>>"
