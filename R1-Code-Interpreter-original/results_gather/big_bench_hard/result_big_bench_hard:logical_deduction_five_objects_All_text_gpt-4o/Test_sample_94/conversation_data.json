    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the first position.\n\n2. **The blue jay is the third from the left.**\n   - This places the blue jay in the third position.\n\n3. **The raven is to the right of the blue jay.**\n   - Since the blue jay is in the third position, the raven must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n\n4. **The robin is to the right of the raven.**\n   - This means the robin must be in a position to the right of the raven. Therefore, the raven cannot be in the fifth position because there would be no room for the robin to be to its right. Thus, the raven must be in the fourth position, and the robin must be in the fifth position.\n\n5. **The quail is the only bird not yet placed.**\n   - Since the cardinal is in the first position, the blue jay is in the third position, the raven is in the fourth position, and the robin is in the fifth position, the quail must be in the second position.\n\nNow, let's list the positions:\n1. Cardinal\n2. Quail\n3. Blue Jay\n4. Raven\n5. Robin\n\nFrom the options given, we need to determine which bird is the third from the left:\n- (A) The cardinal is the third from the left - Incorrect, the cardinal is first.\n- (B) The robin is the third from the left - Incorrect, the robin is fifth.\n- (C) The blue jay is the third from the left - Correct, the blue jay is indeed third.\n- (D) The quail is the third from the left - Incorrect, the quail is second.\n- (E) The raven is the third from the left - Incorrect, the raven is fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
