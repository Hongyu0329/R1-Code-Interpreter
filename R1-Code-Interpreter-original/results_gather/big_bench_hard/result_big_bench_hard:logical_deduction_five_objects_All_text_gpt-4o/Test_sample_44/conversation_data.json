    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vehicles**: We have five vehicles: a tractor, a station wagon, a bus, a motorcycle, and a minivan.\n\n2. **Given statements**:\n   - The minivan is older than the motorcycle.\n   - The bus is the newest.\n   - The tractor is the third-newest.\n   - The station wagon is the second-oldest.\n\n3. **Determine the order**:\n   - Since the bus is the newest, it must be in the 5th position.\n   - The station wagon is the second-oldest, so it must be in the 2nd position.\n   - The tractor is the third-newest, which means it is in the 3rd position.\n   - The minivan is older than the motorcycle, so the minivan must be in an older position than the motorcycle.\n\n4. **Arrange the vehicles**:\n   - The oldest vehicle must be the one not yet placed, which is the minivan or the motorcycle. Since the minivan is older than the motorcycle, the minivan must be the oldest.\n   - Therefore, the order from oldest to newest is: Minivan, Station Wagon, Tractor, Motorcycle, Bus.\n\n5. **Verify the position of the tractor**:\n   - The tractor is indeed the third-newest, as it is in the 3rd position from the newest (or 3rd position from the oldest in a list of 5).\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is (A) The tractor is the third-newest.\n\nFinal answer: <<<A>>>."
