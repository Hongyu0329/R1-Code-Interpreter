    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The green book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the green book is in the 5th position.\n\n2. **The gray book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book is somewhere to the left of the gray book.\n\n3. **The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the purple book is somewhere to the left of the yellow book.\n\n4. **The purple book is to the right of the gray book.**\n   - This means the gray book is somewhere to the left of the purple book.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it is in position 5: _ _ _ _ Green\n- The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so Orange is to the left of Gray.\n- The purple book must be to the left of the yellow book, so Purple is to the left of Yellow.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so Gray is to the left of Purple.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the books:\n\n- Start with the known position: _ _ _ _ Green\n- Place Gray to the left of Purple: _ _ Gray Purple _ Green\n- Place Orange to the left of Gray: Orange _ Gray Purple _ Green\n- Place Yellow to the right of Purple: Orange _ Gray Purple Yellow Green\n\nNow, we have the order: Orange, Gray, Purple, Yellow, Green.\n\nFinally, we need to determine which book is the leftmost:\n\n- The leftmost book is Orange.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
