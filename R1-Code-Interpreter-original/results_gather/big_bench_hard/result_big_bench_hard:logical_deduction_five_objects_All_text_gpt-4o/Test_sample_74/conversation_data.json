    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, from most expensive to least expensive, using the given statements.\n\n1. **Identify the cheapest fruit:**\n   - The pears are the cheapest. Therefore, pears are at the bottom of the list.\n\n2. **Compare mangoes and loquats:**\n   - The mangoes are more expensive than the loquats. This means loquats are cheaper than mangoes.\n\n3. **Compare cantaloupes and mangoes:**\n   - The cantaloupes are more expensive than the mangoes. This means mangoes are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n\n4. **Compare watermelons and cantaloupes:**\n   - The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes. This means cantaloupes are cheaper than watermelons.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits in order from most expensive to least expensive based on the above comparisons:\n\n- Watermelons (most expensive)\n- Cantaloupes\n- Mangoes\n- Loquats\n- Pears (least expensive)\n\n5. **Determine the third-most expensive fruit:**\n   - From the ordered list, the third-most expensive fruit is mangoes.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n\nFinal answer: <<<A>>>."
