    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The blue book is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the blue book is in the first position.\n\n2. **The red book is the third from the left.**\n   - Since the blue book is in the first position, the red book must be in the third position.\n\n3. **The red book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - Since the red book is in the third position, the gray book must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n\n4. **The white book is to the right of the gray book.**\n   - This means the white book must be in a position to the right of the gray book. If the gray book is in the fourth position, the white book must be in the fifth position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the positions of the books:\n\n- **Position 1:** Blue book (from statement 1)\n- **Position 2:** Unknown\n- **Position 3:** Red book (from statement 2)\n- **Position 4:** Gray book (from statement 3 and 4)\n- **Position 5:** White book (from statement 4)\n\nThe only book left to place is the purple book, which must be in the second position.\n\nNow, let's verify the order:\n- Blue book (1st position)\n- Purple book (2nd position)\n- Red book (3rd position)\n- Gray book (4th position)\n- White book (5th position)\n\nThe question asks which book is the rightmost. According to our arrangement, the white book is in the fifth position, which is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
