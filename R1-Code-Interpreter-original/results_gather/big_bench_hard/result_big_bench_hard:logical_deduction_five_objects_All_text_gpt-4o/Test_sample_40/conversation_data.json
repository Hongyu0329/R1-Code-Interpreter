    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The tractor is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is older than the tractor.\n\n2. **The limousine is the second-newest.**\n   - This places the limousine in the fourth position from the oldest.\n\n3. **The truck is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is not the oldest, and the truck is older than both the hatchback and the tractor.\n\n4. **The convertible is the second-oldest.**\n   - This places the convertible in the second position from the oldest.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it must be in the second position.\n- The limousine is the second-newest, so it is in the fourth position.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, and the hatchback is older than the tractor. Therefore, the truck must be in the first position, making it the oldest.\n- The hatchback must be in the third position because it is older than the tractor but younger than the truck and convertible.\n- The tractor, being newer than the hatchback, must be in the fifth position.\n\nThe order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Truck\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Limousine\n5. Tractor\n\nBased on this order, the oldest vehicle is the truck.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
