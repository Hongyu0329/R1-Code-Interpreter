    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The tractor is older than the bus.**\n   - This means the tractor is positioned before the bus in the order from oldest to newest.\n\n2. **The minivan is newer than the bus.**\n   - This means the minivan is positioned after the bus in the order from oldest to newest.\n\n3. **The hatchback is the second-newest.**\n   - This means there is only one vehicle newer than the hatchback.\n\n4. **The minivan is older than the convertible.**\n   - This means the minivan is positioned before the convertible in the order from oldest to newest.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the hatchback is the second-newest, it must be the fourth in the order, with only one vehicle newer than it.\n- The minivan is newer than the bus and older than the convertible, so the minivan cannot be the newest. Therefore, the convertible must be the newest.\n- The order of the last two vehicles (newest) is: Hatchback, Convertible.\n- The minivan, being older than the convertible, must be third in the order.\n- The bus, being older than the minivan, must be second in the order.\n- The tractor, being older than the bus, must be first in the order.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is: Tractor, Bus, Minivan, Hatchback, Convertible.\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the second-oldest:\n\n- The second-oldest vehicle in this order is the Bus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
