    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The tractor is newer than the minivan.**\n   - This means the minivan is older than the tractor.\n\n2. **The tractor is older than the limousine.**\n   - This means the limousine is newer than the tractor.\n\n3. **The convertible is older than the sedan.**\n   - This means the sedan is newer than the convertible.\n\n4. **The convertible is the second-newest.**\n   - This means there is only one vehicle newer than the convertible.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-newest, there must be one vehicle newer than it. The only vehicle that can be newer than the convertible, based on the given information, is the sedan (since the convertible is older than the sedan).\n\n- Therefore, the order from newest to oldest must be: Sedan, Convertible, [Unknown], [Unknown], [Unknown].\n\n- We know the tractor is newer than the minivan and older than the limousine. Therefore, the order of these three vehicles from newest to oldest is: Limousine, Tractor, Minivan.\n\n- Combining all the information, the complete order from newest to oldest is: Sedan, Convertible, Limousine, Tractor, Minivan.\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the second-oldest:\n\n- From the order: Sedan, Convertible, Limousine, Tractor, Minivan, the second-oldest vehicle is the Tractor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
