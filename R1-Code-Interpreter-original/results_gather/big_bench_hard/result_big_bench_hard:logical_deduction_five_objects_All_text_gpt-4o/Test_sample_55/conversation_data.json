    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The owl is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the owl is in the second position.\n\n2. **The hawk is to the left of the owl.**\n   - Since the owl is in the second position, the hawk must be in the first position.\n\n3. **The raven is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the raven is in the fourth position.\n\n4. **The robin is to the left of the raven.**\n   - Since the raven is in the fourth position, the robin must be in the third position.\n\n5. **We have one bird left, the crow, which must be in the remaining position.**\n   - The only position left is the fifth position, so the crow is the rightmost bird.\n\nNow, let's list the positions of the birds:\n1. Hawk\n2. Owl\n3. Robin\n4. Raven\n5. Crow\n\nBased on this arrangement, the crow is the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
