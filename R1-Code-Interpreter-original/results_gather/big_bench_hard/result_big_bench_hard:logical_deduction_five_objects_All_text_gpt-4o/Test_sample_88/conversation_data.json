    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The apples are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This implies: Apples > Oranges\n\n2. **The oranges are more expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This implies: Oranges > Mangoes\n\n3. **The apples are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than apples, and two fruits less expensive than apples.\n\n4. **The pears are more expensive than the watermelons.**\n   - This implies: Pears > Watermelons\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine the order of the fruits:\n\n- Since apples are the third-most expensive, there are two fruits more expensive than apples. Let's denote the order of fruits from most expensive to least expensive as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n- Apples are in position 3. Therefore, the order is: \n  1. ?\n  2. ?\n  3. Apples\n  4. ?\n  5. ?\n\n- From statement 1 and 2, we know: Apples > Oranges > Mangoes. Since apples are in position 3, oranges and mangoes must be in positions 4 and 5. Therefore, the order is:\n  1. ?\n  2. ?\n  3. Apples\n  4. Oranges\n  5. Mangoes\n\n- From statement 4, we know: Pears > Watermelons. Since the only positions left are 1 and 2, pears and watermelons must occupy these positions. Therefore, the order is:\n  1. Pears\n  2. Watermelons\n  3. Apples\n  4. Oranges\n  5. Mangoes\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The apples are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, apples are third.\n\n(B) The oranges are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, oranges are fourth.\n\n(C) The watermelons are the second-most expensive - Correct, watermelons are second.\n\n(D) The pears are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, pears are first.\n\n(E) The mangoes are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, mangoes are fifth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
