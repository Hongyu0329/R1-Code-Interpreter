    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **The red book is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the red book is in the first position.\n\n2. **The green book is to the left of the brown book.**\n   - This means the green book must be placed before the brown book in the order.\n\n3. **The gray book is to the left of the blue book.**\n   - This means the gray book must be placed before the blue book in the order.\n\n4. **The green book is to the right of the blue book.**\n   - This means the blue book must be placed before the green book in the order.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books based on these conditions:\n\n- Start with the red book in the first position: Red, _, _, _, _\n\n- The blue book must be to the left of the green book, and the gray book must be to the left of the blue book. Therefore, the gray book must be to the left of both the blue and green books.\n\n- The only possible order that satisfies all conditions is:\n  - Red, Gray, Blue, Green, Brown\n\nNow, let's determine which book is second from the left:\n\n- The order is: Red, Gray, Blue, Green, Brown\n- The second book from the left is the Gray book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
