    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **The minivan is older than the sedan.**\n   - This means the minivan is not the newest, and the sedan is not the oldest.\n\n2. **The tractor is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the tractor is not the newest, and the hatchback is not the oldest.\n\n3. **The minivan is the third-newest.**\n   - This places the minivan in the third position from the newest, or equivalently, the third-oldest position.\n\n4. **The station wagon is the second-newest.**\n   - This places the station wagon in the second position from the newest, or equivalently, the fourth-oldest position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the order from oldest to newest:\n\n- Since the minivan is the third-newest, it is in the middle position.\n- The station wagon is the second-newest, so it is newer than the minivan.\n- The tractor is older than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the oldest.\n- The sedan is newer than the minivan, so it cannot be the oldest.\n\nNow, let's arrange them:\n\n1. **Oldest:** The only vehicle that can be the oldest, given the conditions, is the tractor.\n2. **Second-oldest:** We need to determine which vehicle fits this position. The minivan is third-oldest, and the station wagon is fourth-oldest. The sedan is newer than the minivan, so it cannot be second-oldest. The hatchback is newer than the tractor, so it can be second-oldest.\n3. **Third-oldest:** Minivan (as given).\n4. **Fourth-oldest:** Station wagon (as given).\n5. **Newest:** Sedan (since it is newer than the minivan and station wagon).\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is: Tractor, Hatchback, Minivan, Station Wagon, Sedan.\n\nThe second-oldest vehicle is the hatchback.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
