    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The gray book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the gray book is positioned somewhere before the green book.\n\n2. **The gray book is the second from the right.**\n   - This places the gray book in the fourth position from the left (or second from the right).\n\n3. **The yellow book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book is positioned somewhere before the yellow book.\n\n4. **The blue book is the second from the left.**\n   - This places the blue book in the second position from the left.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the gray book is second from the right, the positions are as follows: _ _ _ Gray _.\n- The blue book is second from the left, so the positions are: _ Blue _ Gray _.\n- The gray book is to the left of the green book, so the green book must be in the rightmost position: _ Blue _ Gray Green.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the orange book. The only remaining positions are the first and third. Therefore, the orange book must be first, and the yellow book must be third: Orange Blue Yellow Gray Green.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The yellow book is the leftmost - Incorrect, the yellow book is third.\n(B) The green book is the leftmost - Incorrect, the green book is fifth.\n(C) The gray book is the leftmost - Incorrect, the gray book is fourth.\n(D) The blue book is the leftmost - Incorrect, the blue book is second.\n(E) The orange book is the leftmost - Correct, the orange book is first.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
