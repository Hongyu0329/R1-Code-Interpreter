    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the 5th position.\n\n2. **The raven is to the left of the owl.**\n   - This means the raven must be positioned somewhere to the left of the owl.\n\n3. **The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the robin must be positioned somewhere to the right of the hummingbird.\n\n4. **The hummingbird is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the hummingbird is in the 3rd position.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the positions of all the birds:\n\n- Since the hummingbird is in the 3rd position, the positions are as follows:\n  1. [unknown]\n  2. [unknown]\n  3. Hummingbird\n  4. [unknown]\n  5. Cardinal\n\n- The robin must be to the right of the hummingbird, so the robin can only be in the 4th position:\n  1. [unknown]\n  2. [unknown]\n  3. Hummingbird\n  4. Robin\n  5. Cardinal\n\n- The raven is to the left of the owl. The only positions left for the raven and the owl are the 1st and 2nd positions. Therefore, the raven must be in the 1st position and the owl in the 2nd position:\n  1. Raven\n  2. Owl\n  3. Hummingbird\n  4. Robin\n  5. Cardinal\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The raven is the leftmost - This is consistent with our arrangement.\n(B) The owl is the leftmost - This is not consistent, as the owl is in the 2nd position.\n(C) The cardinal is the leftmost - This is not consistent, as the cardinal is in the 5th position.\n(D) The hummingbird is the leftmost - This is not consistent, as the hummingbird is in the 3rd position.\n(E) The robin is the leftmost - This is not consistent, as the robin is in the 4th position.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
