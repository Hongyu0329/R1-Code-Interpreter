    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The green book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - This means the green book must be placed somewhere before the gray book in the order.\n\n2. **The brown book is the third from the left.**\n   - This directly places the brown book in the third position.\n\n3. **The gray book is the second from the right.**\n   - Since there are five books, the gray book is in the fourth position.\n\n4. **The yellow book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the yellow book must be placed somewhere before the green book in the order.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- We know the brown book is in the third position.\n- The gray book is in the fourth position.\n- The green book must be to the left of the gray book, so it can be in the first or second position.\n- The yellow book must be to the left of the green book, so it must be in the first position if the green book is in the second position.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 1:** Yellow book (since it must be to the left of the green book)\n- **Position 2:** Green book (since it must be to the left of the gray book)\n- **Position 3:** Brown book (as given)\n- **Position 4:** Gray book (as given)\n- **Position 5:** Orange book (the only book left)\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The green book is to the left of the gray book: **True** (Position 2 is left of Position 4)\n- The brown book is the third from the left: **True** (Position 3)\n- The gray book is the second from the right: **True** (Position 4)\n- The yellow book is to the left of the green book: **True** (Position 1 is left of Position 2)\n\nThe order of the books is: Yellow, Green, Brown, Gray, Orange.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The brown book is the third from the left: **True**\n(B) The yellow book is the third from the left: **False**\n(C) The orange book is the third from the left: **False**\n(D) The green book is the third from the left: **False**\n(E) The gray book is the third from the left: **False**\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
