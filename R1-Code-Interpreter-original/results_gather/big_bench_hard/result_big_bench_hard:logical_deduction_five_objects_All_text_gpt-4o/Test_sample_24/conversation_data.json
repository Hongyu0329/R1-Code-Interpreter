    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The brown book is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the brown book is in the first position.\n\n2. **The black book is the third from the left.**\n   - This places the black book in the third position.\n\n3. **The black book is to the left of the purple book.**\n   - Since the black book is in the third position, the purple book must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n\n4. **The yellow book is to the right of the purple book.**\n   - This means the yellow book must be placed after the purple book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the remaining books:\n\n- The brown book is in the first position.\n- The black book is in the third position.\n- The purple book must be in the fourth position because the yellow book is to the right of it.\n- The yellow book must be in the fifth position.\n- This leaves the gray book to be placed in the second position.\n\nThe final order from left to right is:\n1. Brown book\n2. Gray book\n3. Black book\n4. Purple book\n5. Yellow book\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The yellow book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's fifth.\n(B) The brown book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's first.\n(C) The gray book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's second.\n(D) The black book is the third from the left - Correct, as per the given condition.\n(E) The purple book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
