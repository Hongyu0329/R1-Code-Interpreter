    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The gray book is to the left of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the gray book is positioned somewhere before the yellow book.\n\n2. **The white book is to the left of the red book.**\n   - This means the white book is positioned somewhere before the red book.\n\n3. **The black book is to the right of the red book.**\n   - This means the black book is positioned somewhere after the red book.\n\n4. **The black book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - This means the black book is positioned somewhere before the gray book.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books based on these conditions:\n\n- From condition 3, we know the order of the red and black books: Red, Black.\n- From condition 4, we know the order of the black and gray books: Black, Gray.\n- From condition 2, we know the order of the white and red books: White, Red.\n- From condition 1, we know the order of the gray and yellow books: Gray, Yellow.\n\nCombining these conditions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The white book must be the first because it is to the left of the red book.\n- The red book comes next because it is to the left of the black book.\n- The black book follows because it is to the left of the gray book.\n- The gray book comes next because it is to the left of the yellow book.\n- Finally, the yellow book is the last one.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: White, Red, Black, Gray, Yellow.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The yellow book is the rightmost - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(B) The gray book is the rightmost - This is false; the gray book is not the rightmost.\n(C) The red book is the rightmost - This is false; the red book is not the rightmost.\n(D) The black book is the rightmost - This is false; the black book is not the rightmost.\n(E) The white book is the rightmost - This is false; the white book is not the rightmost.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
