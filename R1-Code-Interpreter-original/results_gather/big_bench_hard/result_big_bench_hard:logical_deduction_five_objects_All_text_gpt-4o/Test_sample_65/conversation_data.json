    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **The brown book is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the brown book is in position 3.\n\n2. **The gray book is the second from the right.**\n   - Since there are five books, the gray book is in position 4.\n\n3. **The green book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - The green book must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\n4. **The yellow book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - The yellow book must be in a position to the left of the green book.\n\nNow, let's place the books based on these conditions:\n\n- The brown book is in position 3.\n- The gray book is in position 4.\n- The green book must be in position 1 or 2 because it is to the left of the gray book.\n- The yellow book must be in position 1 if the green book is in position 2, or in position 2 if the green book is in position 3.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n- If the green book is in position 2, then the yellow book must be in position 1.\n  - This gives us: Yellow, Green, Brown, Gray, (unknown).\n- The only book left is the orange book, which must be in position 5.\n\nThus, the order of the books is:\n1. Yellow\n2. Green\n3. Brown\n4. Gray\n5. Orange\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The brown book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is third from the left.\n(B) The yellow book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is first from the left.\n(C) The orange book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is last.\n(D) The green book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is second from the left.\n(E) The gray book is the second from the right - Correct, as per the given condition.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
