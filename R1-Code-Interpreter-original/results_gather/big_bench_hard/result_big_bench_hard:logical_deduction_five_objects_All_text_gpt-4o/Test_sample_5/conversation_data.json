    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The gray book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book is not the last book on the right.\n\n2. **The green book is the second from the right.**\n   - This fixes the position of the green book as the fourth book from the left.\n\n3. **The brown book is to the right of the white book.**\n   - This means the white book is not the last book on the right.\n\n4. **The brown book is to the left of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book is not the first book on the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the books:\n\n- Since the green book is the second from the right, the positions are:\n  1. ___\n  2. ___\n  3. ___\n  4. Green\n  5. ___\n\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, and the brown book is to the left of the orange book. Therefore, the orange book cannot be in position 5, and the brown book cannot be in position 4 or 5. The only possible position for the orange book is position 5, and the brown book must be in position 3.\n\n- Placing the orange and brown books:\n  1. ___\n  2. ___\n  3. Brown\n  4. Green\n  5. Orange\n\n- The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so it must be in position 5. This means the orange book must be in position 3, and the brown book must be in position 2.\n\n- Placing the gray book:\n  1. ___\n  2. ___\n  3. Brown\n  4. Green\n  5. Gray\n\n- The white book must be to the left of the brown book, so it must be in position 1.\n\n- Placing the white book:\n  1. White\n  2. ___\n  3. Brown\n  4. Green\n  5. Gray\n\n- The only remaining book is the orange book, which must be in position 2.\n\n- Final arrangement:\n  1. White\n  2. Orange\n  3. Brown\n  4. Green\n  5. Gray\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The white book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's first.\n(B) The green book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's fourth.\n(C) The brown book is the third from the left - Correct.\n(D) The gray book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's fifth.\n(E) The orange book is the third from the left - Incorrect, it's second.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
