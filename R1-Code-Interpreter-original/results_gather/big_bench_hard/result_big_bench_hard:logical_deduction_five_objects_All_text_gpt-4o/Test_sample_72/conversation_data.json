    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Eve finished last.**\n   - This means Eve is in the 5th position.\n\n2. **Rob finished above Mel.**\n   - This means Rob's position is better (lower number) than Mel's position.\n\n3. **Amy finished above Rob.**\n   - This means Amy's position is better (lower number) than Rob's position.\n\n4. **Mya finished third.**\n   - This means Mya is in the 3rd position.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine the positions of each golfer:\n\n- Since Mya is 3rd, we have:  \n  1. ___  \n  2. ___  \n  3. Mya  \n  4. ___  \n  5. Eve  \n\n- Amy finished above Rob, and Rob finished above Mel. Therefore, the order of Amy, Rob, and Mel must be: Amy, Rob, Mel.\n\n- Since Mya is 3rd and Eve is 5th, the only positions left for Amy, Rob, and Mel are 1st, 2nd, and 4th.\n\n- Given that Amy finished above Rob, and Rob finished above Mel, the only possible arrangement is:\n  1. Amy  \n  2. Rob  \n  3. Mya  \n  4. Mel  \n  5. Eve  \n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) Amy finished third - Incorrect, Amy finished 1st.\n(B) Eve finished third - Incorrect, Eve finished 5th.\n(C) Mel finished third - Incorrect, Mel finished 4th.\n(D) Mya finished third - Correct, Mya finished 3rd.\n(E) Rob finished third - Incorrect, Rob finished 2nd.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
