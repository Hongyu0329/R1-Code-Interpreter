    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The convertible is newer than the truck.**\n   - This means the truck is older than the convertible.\n\n2. **The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is older than the station wagon.\n\n3. **The convertible is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is newer than the convertible.\n\n4. **The station wagon is the second-newest.**\n   - This means there is only one vehicle newer than the station wagon.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- From statement 4, the station wagon is the second-newest. Therefore, there is one vehicle that is newer than the station wagon.\n- From statement 2, the hatchback is older than the station wagon.\n- From statement 3, the convertible is older than the hatchback, which means the convertible is also older than the station wagon.\n- From statement 1, the truck is older than the convertible.\n\nGiven these points, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Truck\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Station Wagon\n5.
