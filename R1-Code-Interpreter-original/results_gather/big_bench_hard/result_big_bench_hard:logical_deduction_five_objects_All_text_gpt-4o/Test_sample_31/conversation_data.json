    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions and then identify which bird is third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze the given conditions step by step:\n\n1. **The owl is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the owl is in the first position.\n\n2. **The robin is to the left of the raven.**\n   - This means the robin must be positioned somewhere before the raven.\n\n3. **The quail is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the quail is in the fifth position.\n\n4. **The raven is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the raven is in the third position.\n\nNow, let's arrange the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the owl is the leftmost, it is in the first position.\n- The raven is the third from the left, so it is in the third position.\n- The quail is the rightmost, so it is in the fifth position.\n- The robin must be to the left of the raven, so it must be in the second position.\n- The only remaining position is the fourth, which must be occupied by the falcon.\n\nThus, the order of the birds from left to right is:\n1. Owl\n2. Robin\n3. Raven\n4. Falcon\n5. Quail\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is third from the left. According to our arrangement, the raven is third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
