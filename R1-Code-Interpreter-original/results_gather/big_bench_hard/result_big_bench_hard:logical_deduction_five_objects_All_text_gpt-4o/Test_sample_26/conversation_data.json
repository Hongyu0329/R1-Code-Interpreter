    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished the tournament based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Joe finished second.**\n   - This means Joe is in the 2nd position.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Amy.**\n   - Since Joe is in the 2nd position, Amy must be in the 1st position because she finished above Joe.\n\n3. **Mel finished second-to-last.**\n   - The second-to-last position is the 4th position. Therefore, Mel is in the 4th position.\n\n4. **Ada finished last.**\n   - The last position is the 5th position. Therefore, Ada is in the 5th position.\n\nNow, let's summarize the positions we have determined so far:\n- 1st: Amy\n- 2nd: Joe\n- 4th: Mel\n- 5th: Ada\n\nThe only position left is the 3rd position, which must be occupied by Rob, as he is the only golfer not yet placed.\n\nThus, the final order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- (A) Amy finished last: Incorrect, Amy finished 1st.\n- (B) Mel finished last: Incorrect, Mel finished 4th.\n- (C) Rob finished last: Incorrect, Rob finished 3rd.\n- (D) Joe finished last: Incorrect, Joe finished 2nd.\n- (E) Ada finished last: Correct, Ada finished 5th.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
