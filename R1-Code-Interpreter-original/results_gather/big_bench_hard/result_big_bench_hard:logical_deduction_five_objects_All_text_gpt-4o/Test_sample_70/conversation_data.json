    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The green book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - This means the green book is positioned somewhere before the gray book.\n\n2. **The brown book is the third from the left.**\n   - This fixes the position of the brown book as the third book on the shelf.\n\n3. **The gray book is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the gray book is the fourth book on the shelf.\n\n4. **The yellow book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the yellow book is positioned somewhere before the green book.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the brown book is the third from the left, the order starts as: _ _ Brown _ _.\n\n- The gray book is the second from the right, so it must be the fourth book: _ _ Brown Gray _.\n\n- The green book is to the left of the gray book, so it must be the first or second book: Green _ Brown Gray _ or _ Green Brown Gray _.\n\n- The yellow book is to the left of the green book, so it must be the first book if the green book is the second: Yellow Green Brown Gray _.\n\n- The only book left is the orange book, which must be the fifth book: Yellow Green Brown Gray Orange.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Yellow, Green, Brown, Gray, Orange.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The brown book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the brown book is in the middle.\n(B) The yellow book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the yellow book is the leftmost.\n(C) The orange book is the rightmost - Correct, as the orange book is the fifth and last book.\n(D) The green book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the green book is the second.\n(E) The gray book is the rightmost - Incorrect, as the gray book is the fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
