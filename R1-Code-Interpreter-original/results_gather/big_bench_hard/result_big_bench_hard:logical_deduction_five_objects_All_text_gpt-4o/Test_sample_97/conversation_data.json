    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The peaches are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means that oranges are cheaper than peaches.\n\n2. **The cantaloupes are more expensive than the peaches.**\n   - This means that cantaloupes are more expensive than both peaches and oranges.\n\n3. **The kiwis are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means that there are two fruits more expensive than kiwis and two fruits cheaper than kiwis.\n\n4. **The loquats are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means that there is only one fruit cheaper than loquats.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine the order of the fruits:\n\n- Since loquats are the second-cheapest, there must be one fruit cheaper than loquats. \n- The kiwis are the third-most expensive, so there are two fruits more expensive than kiwis.\n- The cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches, and peaches are more expensive than oranges.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the fruits in order:\n\n- **Cheapest:** Oranges (since loquats are second-cheapest, oranges must be the cheapest)\n- **Second-cheapest:** Loquats\n- **Third-most expensive:** Kiwis\n- **Fourth-most expensive:** Peaches (since peaches are more expensive than oranges and loquats, but less expensive than cantaloupes)\n- **Most expensive:** Cantaloupes (since cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches)\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is: Oranges, Loquats, Kiwis, Peaches, Cantaloupes.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The oranges are the cheapest - This matches our analysis.\n- (B) The cantaloupes are the cheapest - This does not match.\n- (C) The peaches are the cheapest - This does not match.\n- (D) The loquats are the cheapest - This does not match.\n- (E) The kiwis are the cheapest - This does not match.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
