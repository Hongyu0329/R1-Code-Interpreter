    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, from cheapest to most expensive, using the given statements:\n\n1. The oranges are more expensive than the mangoes.\n2. The plums are the cheapest.\n3. The apples are less expensive than the mangoes.\n4. The pears are more expensive than the oranges.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- From statement 2, we know that plums are the cheapest. So, plums are in the first position.\n\n- From statement 3, apples are less expensive than mangoes. This means apples come before mangoes in the order.\n\n- From statement 1, oranges are more expensive than mangoes. This means oranges come after mangoes in the order.\n\n- From statement 4, pears are more expensive than oranges. This means pears come after oranges in the order.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n1. Plums (cheapest)\n2. Apples (since apples are less expensive than mangoes)\n3. Mangoes (since mangoes are less expensive than oranges)\n4. Oranges (since oranges are less expensive than pears)\n5. Pears (most expensive)\n\nWith this arrangement, we can see that the second-cheapest fruit is apples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
