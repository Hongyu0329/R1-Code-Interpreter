    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Rob finished below Dan.**\n   - This means Dan finished higher than Rob.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Ana.**\n   - This means Ana finished higher than Joe.\n\n3. **Joe finished above Amy.**\n   - This means Joe finished higher than Amy.\n\n4. **Dan finished below Amy.**\n   - This means Amy finished higher than Dan.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the golfers based on these conditions:\n\n- From statement 3, we know Joe > Amy.\n- From statement 4, we know Amy > Dan.\n- Combining these, we get Joe > Amy > Dan.\n\n- From statement 1, we know Dan > Rob.\n- Combining this with the previous, we get Joe > Amy > Dan > Rob.\n\n- From statement 2, we know Ana > Joe.\n- Combining this with the previous, we get Ana > Joe > Amy > Dan > Rob.\n\nNow, we have a complete order: Ana, Joe, Amy, Dan, Rob.\n\nFinally, we need to determine who finished last. According to the order, Rob is the last golfer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
