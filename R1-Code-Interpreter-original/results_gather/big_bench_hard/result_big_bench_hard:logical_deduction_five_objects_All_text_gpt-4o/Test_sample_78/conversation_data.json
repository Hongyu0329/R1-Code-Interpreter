    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Mel finished first.**\n   - This means Mel is in the 1st position.\n\n2. **Amy finished below Dan.**\n   - This implies that Dan finished in a higher position than Amy.\n\n3. **Joe finished above Dan.**\n   - This means Joe is in a higher position than Dan.\n\n4. **Eve finished last.**\n   - Eve is in the 5th position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the positions:\n\n- **Mel** is 1st.\n- **Eve** is 5th.\n\nNow, we need to place Dan, Amy, and Joe in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th positions, keeping in mind:\n- Joe is above Dan.\n- Dan is above Amy.\n\nThe only order that satisfies these conditions is:\n- **Joe** in 2nd position.\n- **Dan** in 3rd position.\n- **Amy** in 4th position.\n\nNow, let's check the options for who finished second-to-last (4th position):\n- Mel is 1st.\n- Joe is 2nd.\n- Dan is 3rd.\n- Amy is 4th.\n- Eve is 5th.\n\nTherefore, Amy finished second-to-last.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<<<C>>>"
