    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Ada finished above Mel.**\n   - This means Ada's position is better (lower number) than Mel's.\n\n2. **Mel finished above Dan.**\n   - This means Mel's position is better than Dan's.\n\n3. **Joe finished below Dan.**\n   - This means Joe's position is worse (higher number) than Dan's.\n\n4. **Ada finished second.**\n   - This directly tells us Ada's position is 2nd.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the positions of the other golfers:\n\n- Since Ada is 2nd, and she finished above Mel, Mel cannot be 1st or 2nd. Therefore, Mel must be 3rd or lower.\n- Mel finished above Dan, so Mel cannot be 4th or 5th. Therefore, Mel must be 3rd.\n- Dan must be below Mel, so Dan cannot be 3rd. Therefore, Dan must be 4th or 5th.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe must be 5th.\n- Since Joe is 5th, Dan must be 4th.\n- The only position left for Rob is 1st.\n\nThus, the final order is:\n1. Rob\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nFrom the options given, we need to find who finished third:\n- (A) Rob finished third - Incorrect, Rob finished 1st.\n- (B) Ada finished third - Incorrect, Ada finished 2nd.\n- (C) Dan finished third - Incorrect, Dan finished 4th.\n- (D) Joe finished third - Incorrect, Joe finished 5th.\n- (E) Mel finished third - Correct, Mel finished 3rd.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
