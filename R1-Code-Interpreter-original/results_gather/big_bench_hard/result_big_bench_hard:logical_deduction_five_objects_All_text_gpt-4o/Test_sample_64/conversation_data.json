    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The red book is to the right of the gray book.**\n   - This means the gray book cannot be the rightmost book.\n\n2. **The black book is to the left of the blue book.**\n   - This means the black book cannot be the rightmost book.\n\n3. **The blue book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - This means the blue book cannot be the rightmost book.\n\n4. **The purple book is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the purple book is not the rightmost book, but the book immediately to its right is the rightmost.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order:\n\n- Since the purple book is second from the right, the order from the rightmost position is: [?, Purple, ?].\n- The gray book cannot be the rightmost, so it cannot be in the rightmost position.\n- The black book is to the left of the blue book, and the blue book is to the left of the gray book, so the order from left to right must be: [Black, Blue, Gray].\n- The red book is to the right of the gray book, so it must be in the rightmost position.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: [Black, Blue, Gray, Purple, Red].\n\nTherefore, the rightmost book is the red book.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
