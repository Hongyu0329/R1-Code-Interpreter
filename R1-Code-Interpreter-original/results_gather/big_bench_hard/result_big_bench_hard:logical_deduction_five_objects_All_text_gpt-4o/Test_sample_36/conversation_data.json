    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, from most expensive to least expensive, using the given statements:\n\n1. \"The peaches are more expensive than the mangoes.\"\n   - This implies: Peaches > Mangoes\n\n2. \"The oranges are more expensive than the kiwis.\"\n   - This implies: Oranges > Kiwis\n\n3. \"The pears are the most expensive.\"\n   - This implies: Pears > all other fruits\n\n4. \"The mangoes are more expensive than the oranges.\"\n   - This implies: Mangoes > Oranges\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that Pears are the most expensive, so they are at the top of the list.\n- From statement 1, Peaches are more expensive than Mangoes.\n- From statement 4, Mangoes are more expensive than Oranges.\n- From statement 2, Oranges are more expensive than Kiwis.\n\nCombining all these, we get the order:\n- Pears > Peaches > Mangoes > Oranges > Kiwis\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the cheapest. From the order above, Kiwis are at the bottom, making them the cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
