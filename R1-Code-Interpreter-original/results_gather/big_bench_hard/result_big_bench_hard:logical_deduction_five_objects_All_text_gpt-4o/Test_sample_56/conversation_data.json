    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Mya finished first.**\n   - This means Mya is in the 1st position.\n\n2. **Dan finished last.**\n   - This means Dan is in the 5th position.\n\n3. **Amy finished above Mel.**\n   - This means Amy's position is better (lower number) than Mel's position.\n\n4. **Amy finished below Eli.**\n   - This means Eli's position is better (lower number) than Amy's position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n- Mya is 1st.\n- Dan is 5th.\n- Amy must be above Mel, so Amy cannot be 4th if Mel is 3rd. Therefore, Mel cannot be 3rd.\n- Amy must be below Eli, so Eli cannot be 4th if Amy is 3rd. Therefore, Amy cannot be 3rd.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible positions for Eli, Amy, and Mel:\n\n- Since Mya is 1st and Dan is 5th, the remaining positions are 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.\n- Eli must be above Amy, so Eli cannot be 4th if Amy is 3rd. Therefore, Eli must be 2nd.\n- With Eli in 2nd, Amy must be below Eli, so Amy can be either 3rd or 4th.\n- Since Amy must be above Mel, Amy cannot be 4th if Mel is 3rd. Therefore, Amy must be 3rd.\n- This leaves Mel in 4th position.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Mya\n2. Eli\n3. Amy\n4. Mel\n5. Dan\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n(A) Amy finished third - This is consistent with our analysis.\n(B) Dan finished third - Incorrect, Dan finished last.\n(C) Mya finished third - Incorrect, Mya finished first.\n(D) Eli finished third - Incorrect, Eli finished second.\n(E) Mel finished third - Incorrect, Mel finished fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
