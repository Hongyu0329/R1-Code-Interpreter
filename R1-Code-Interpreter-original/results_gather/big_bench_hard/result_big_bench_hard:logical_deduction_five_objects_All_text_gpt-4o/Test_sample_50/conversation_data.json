    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The blue book is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the blue book is in the first position.\n\n2. **The red book is the third from the left.**\n   - Since the blue book is in the first position, the red book must be in the third position.\n\n3. **The red book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - This means the gray book must be in a position to the right of the red book. Since the red book is in the third position, the gray book can only be in the fourth or fifth position.\n\n4. **The white book is to the right of the gray book.**\n   - This means the white book must be in a position to the right of the gray book. If the gray book is in the fourth position, the white book must be in the fifth position. If the gray book is in the fifth position, the white book cannot be to its right, so the gray book must be in the fourth position and the white book in the fifth position.\n\n5. **Determine the position of the purple book.**\n   - The blue book is in the first position, the red book is in the third position, the gray book is in the fourth position, and the white book is in the fifth position. The only position left for the purple book is the second position.\n\nNow, let's list the books in order from left to right:\n1. Blue book\n2. Purple book\n3. Red book\n4. Gray book\n5. White book\n\nFinally, we need to determine which book is the second from the right:\n- The second from the right is the gray book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
