    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Dan finished last.**\n   - This means Dan is in the 5th position.\n\n2. **Amy finished above Eli.**\n   - This implies Amy's position is better (lower number) than Eli's.\n\n3. **Ana finished above Amy.**\n   - This means Ana's position is better than Amy's.\n\n4. **Mya finished below Eli.**\n   - This means Mya's position is worse (higher number) than Eli's.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the golfers:\n\n- Since Dan is last, the positions 1 to 4 are left for Ana, Amy, Eli, and Mya.\n- Ana must be above Amy, and Amy must be above Eli, so the order of these three must be Ana, Amy, Eli.\n- Mya must be below Eli, so Mya is in the 4th position.\n\nNow, let's assign the positions:\n\n1. Ana\n2. Amy\n3. Eli\n4. Mya\n5. Dan\n\nWith this arrangement, Eli is in the 3rd position.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
