    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The hummingbird is to the left of the owl.**\n   - This means the order is: Hummingbird, Owl (H < O).\n\n2. **The hummingbird is to the right of the cardinal.**\n   - This means the order is: Cardinal, Hummingbird (C < H).\n\n3. **The crow is to the left of the robin.**\n   - This means the order is: Crow, Robin (Cr < R).\n\n4. **The owl is to the left of the crow.**\n   - This means the order is: Owl, Crow (O < Cr).\n\nNow, let's combine these conditions to find the complete order:\n\n- From conditions 1 and 4, we have: H < O < Cr.\n- From conditions 2 and 1, we have: C < H < O.\n- From condition 3, we have: Cr < R.\n\nCombining all these, we get:\n- C < H < O < Cr < R\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which bird is the rightmost:\n\n- (A) The owl is the rightmost: Incorrect, because the owl is not the last in the sequence.\n- (B) The cardinal is the rightmost: Incorrect, because the cardinal is the first in the sequence.\n- (C) The robin is the rightmost: Correct, because the robin is the last in the sequence.\n- (D) The hummingbird is the rightmost: Incorrect, because the hummingbird is not the last in the sequence.\n- (E) The crow is the rightmost: Incorrect, because the crow is not the last in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
