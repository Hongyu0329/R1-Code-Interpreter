    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given statements:\n\n1. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n2. The mangoes are less expensive than the pears.\n3. The apples are the second-cheapest.\n4. The watermelons are less expensive than the mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that the apples are the second-cheapest. This means there is only one fruit cheaper than the apples.\n\n- From statement 1, the watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes. This implies that cantaloupes are cheaper than watermelons.\n\n- From statement 4, the watermelons are less expensive than the mangoes. This implies that mangoes are more expensive than watermelons.\n\n- From statement 2, the mangoes are less expensive than the pears. This implies that pears are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since apples are the second-cheapest, there must be one fruit cheaper than apples. Given the statements, cantaloupes are the only fruit that can be cheaper than apples. So, cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\n- Therefore, the order starts with cantaloupes, followed by apples.\n\n- Next, we know that watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes but less expensive than mangoes. Therefore, watermelons must come after apples.\n\n- Mangoes are more expensive than watermelons but less expensive than pears. Therefore, mangoes come after watermelons.\n\n- Finally, pears are the most expensive, as they are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nThe order of the fruits from cheapest to most expensive is: cantaloupes, apples, watermelons, mangoes, pears.\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The watermelons are the second-cheapest - Incorrect, as watermelons are third in order.\n(B) The apples are the second-cheapest - Correct, as apples are indeed second in order.\n(C) The mangoes are the second-cheapest - Incorrect, as mangoes are fourth in order.\n(D) The pears are the second-cheapest - Incorrect, as pears are the most expensive.\n(E) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest - Incorrect, as cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
