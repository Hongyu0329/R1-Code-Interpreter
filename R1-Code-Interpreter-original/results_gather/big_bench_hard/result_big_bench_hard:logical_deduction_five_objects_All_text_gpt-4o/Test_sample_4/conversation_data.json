    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The green book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the green book is in the 5th position.\n\n2. **The gray book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This implies that the orange book is somewhere to the left of the gray book.\n\n3. **The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the purple book is somewhere to the left of the yellow book.\n\n4. **The purple book is to the right of the gray book.**\n   - This implies that the gray book is somewhere to the left of the purple book.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books in order:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it is in position 5.\n- The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be in position 4 or 5.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in position 1.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be in position 4 or 5.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n- **Position 5:** Green book (G)\n- **Position 4:** Yellow book (Y) (since purple is to the left of yellow)\n- **Position 3:** Purple book (P) (since purple is to the right of gray)\n- **Position 2:** Gray book (Gr) (since gray is to the right of orange)\n- **Position 1:** Orange book (O) (since orange is to the left of gray)\n\nThe order of the books from left to right is: Orange, Gray, Purple, Yellow, Green.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The green book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is the rightmost.\n(B) The orange book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is the leftmost.\n(C) The gray book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is the second from the left.\n(D) The yellow book is the second from the right - Correct, it is in position 4.\n(E) The purple book is the second from the right - Incorrect, it is in position 3.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
