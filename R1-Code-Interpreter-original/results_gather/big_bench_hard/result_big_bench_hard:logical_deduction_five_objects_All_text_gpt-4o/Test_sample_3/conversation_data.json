    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the 5th position.\n\n2. **The raven is to the left of the owl.**\n   - This means the raven must be positioned somewhere to the left of the owl.\n\n3. **The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the robin must be positioned somewhere to the right of the hummingbird.\n\n4. **The hummingbird is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the hummingbird is in the 3rd position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- Since the hummingbird is in the 3rd position, the positions are as follows: [_, _, Hummingbird, _, _].\n\n- The cardinal is the rightmost, so it is in the 5th position: [_, _, Hummingbird, _, Cardinal].\n\n- The robin is to the right of the hummingbird, so the robin must be in the 4th position: [_, _, Hummingbird, Robin, Cardinal].\n\n- The raven is to the left of the owl. The only positions left are the 1st and 2nd. Therefore, the raven must be in the 1st position and the owl in the 2nd position: [Raven, Owl, Hummingbird, Robin, Cardinal].\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The raven is the second from the left - Incorrect, the raven is the first from the left.\n\n(B) The owl is the second from the left - Correct, the owl is indeed in the second position.\n\n(C) The cardinal is the second from the left - Incorrect, the cardinal is the fifth from the left.\n\n(D) The hummingbird is the second from the left - Incorrect, the hummingbird is the third from the left.\n\n(E) The robin is the second from the left - Incorrect, the robin is the fourth from the left.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
