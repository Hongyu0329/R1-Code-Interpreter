  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Eve, Eli, Joe, Rob, and Mya. Rob finished above Mya. Eve finished first. Joe finished above Eli. Joe finished below Mya.\nOptions:\n(A) Eve finished second-to-last\n(B) Eli finished second-to-last\n(C) Joe finished second-to-last\n(D) Rob finished second-to-last\n(E) Mya finished second-to-last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Eve finished first.**\n   - This means Eve is in position 1.\n\n2. **Rob finished above Mya.**\n   - This means Rob's position is less than Mya's position.\n\n3. **Joe finished above Eli.**\n   - This means Joe's position is less than Eli's position.\n\n4. **Joe finished below Mya.**\n   - This means Joe's position is greater than Mya's position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- Since Eve is first, the order starts with Eve: [Eve, _, _, _, _].\n\n- Rob must be above Mya, and Joe must be below Mya. Therefore, Mya cannot be in the second position because Joe would have to be below her, and there would be no room for Rob to be above her. So, Mya must be in the third position or later.\n\n- Joe is below Mya, so Joe cannot be in the second position either. Therefore, Mya must be in the second position, and Joe must be in the third position or later.\n\n- If Mya is in the second position, then Rob must be in the third position because he must be above Mya.\n\n- Joe must be below Mya, so Joe must be in the fourth position.\n\n- Eli, being below Joe, must be in the fifth position.\n\nThus, the order is:\n1. Eve\n2. Mya\n3. Rob\n4. Joe\n5. Eli\n\nNow, let's determine who finished second-to-last:\n- The second-to-last position is the fourth position, which is occupied by Joe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<C>>>"
