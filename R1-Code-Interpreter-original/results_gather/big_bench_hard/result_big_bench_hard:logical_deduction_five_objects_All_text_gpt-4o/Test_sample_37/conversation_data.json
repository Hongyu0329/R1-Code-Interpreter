    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **The yellow book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the yellow book is in the 5th position.\n\n2. **The black book is to the left of the orange book.**\n   - This means the black book is positioned somewhere before the orange book.\n\n3. **The orange book is to the left of the purple book.**\n   - This means the orange book is positioned somewhere before the purple book.\n\n4. **The black book is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the black book is in the 2nd position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the books:\n\n- Since the black book is second from the left, it is in position 2.\n- The yellow book is the rightmost, so it is in position 5.\n- The black book is to the left of the orange book, and the orange book is to the left of the purple book. Therefore, the order from left to right for these three books must be: black, orange, purple.\n- The black book is already in position 2, so the orange book must be in position 3, and the purple book must be in position 4.\n\nNow, let's place the red book:\n\n- The only position left is the first position, so the red book must be in position 1.\n\nThe final order of the books from left to right is:\n1. Red book\n2. Black book\n3. Orange book\n4. Purple book\n5. Yellow book\n\nNow, we need to determine which book is second from the right:\n- The second from the right is position 4, which is occupied by the purple book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
