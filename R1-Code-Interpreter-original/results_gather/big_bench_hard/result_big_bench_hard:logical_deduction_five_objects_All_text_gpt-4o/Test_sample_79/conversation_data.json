    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the birds.\n\n1. **Identify the positions based on the given statements:**\n   - The robin is the second from the left.\n   - The quail is the leftmost.\n   - The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.\n   - The hawk is the third from the left.\n\n2. **Start placing the birds based on the fixed positions:**\n   - Since the quail is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n   - The robin is the second from the left, so it is in position 2.\n   - The hawk is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of the blue jay and the hummingbird:**\n   - The blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird.\n   - The only remaining positions are 4 and 5.\n   - Therefore, the blue jay must be in position 4, and the hummingbird must be in position 5.\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - Position 1: Quail\n   - Position 2: Robin\n   - Position 3: Hawk\n   - Position 4: Blue Jay\n   - Position 5: Hummingbird\n\n5. **Check the options:**\n   - (A) The quail is the third from the left - Incorrect, the quail is first.\n   - (B) The hummingbird is the third from the left - Incorrect, the hummingbird is fifth.\n   - (C) The blue jay is the third from the left - Incorrect, the blue jay is fourth.\n   - (D) The hawk is the third from the left - Correct, the hawk is third.\n   - (E) The robin is the third from the left - Incorrect, the robin is second.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
