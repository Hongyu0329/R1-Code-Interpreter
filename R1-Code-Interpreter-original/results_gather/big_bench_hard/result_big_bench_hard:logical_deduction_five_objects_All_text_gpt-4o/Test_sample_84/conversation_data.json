    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the newest vehicle:**\n   - The bus is the newest.\n\n2. **Identify the third-newest vehicle:**\n   - The tractor is the third-newest.\n\n3. **Identify the second-oldest vehicle:**\n   - The station wagon is the second-oldest.\n\n4. **Determine the relative age of the minivan and the motorcycle:**\n   - The minivan is older than the motorcycle.\n\nGiven these points, let's arrange the vehicles in order from oldest to newest:\n\n- Since the station wagon is the second-oldest, it must be the second vehicle in the order.\n- The minivan is older than the motorcycle, so the minivan must come before the motorcycle.\n- The bus is the newest, so it must be the last vehicle in the order.\n- The tractor is the third-newest, so it must be the third vehicle in the order.\n\nNow, let's fill in the order:\n\n1. Oldest: ?\n2. Second-oldest: Station wagon\n3. Third-newest: Tractor\n4. Fourth-newest: ?\n5. Newest: Bus\n\nSince the minivan is older than the motorcycle, the minivan must be the oldest, and the motorcycle must be the fourth-newest.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Minivan\n2. Station wagon\n3. Tractor\n4. Motorcycle\n5. Bus\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the second-newest:\n- The second-newest vehicle is the fourth vehicle in the order, which is the motorcycle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
