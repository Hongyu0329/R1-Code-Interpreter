    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Rob finished above Mel.**\n   - This means Rob's position is better (lower number) than Mel's.\n\n2. **Mel finished second.**\n   - Mel is in the 2nd position.\n\n3. **Ana finished above Eli.**\n   - Ana's position is better (lower number) than Eli's.\n\n4. **Dan finished last.**\n   - Dan is in the 5th position.\n\nGiven these statements, let's deduce the positions:\n\n- Since Mel is in 2nd place, and Rob finished above Mel, Rob must be in 1st place.\n- Dan is in 5th place.\n- Ana finished above Eli, so Ana must be in 3rd or 4th place, and Eli must be in 4th or 3rd place, respectively.\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions:\n\n1. Rob\n2. Mel\n3. Ana\n4. Eli\n5. Dan\n\nWith this order, we can see that Eli is in the 4th position, which is second-to-last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
