    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The raven is to the right of the owl.**\n   - This means the owl is somewhere to the left of the raven.\n\n2. **The raven is the second from the left.**\n   - This places the raven in the second position.\n\n3. **The robin is to the left of the crow.**\n   - This means the robin is somewhere to the left of the crow.\n\n4. **The robin is the second from the right.**\n   - This places the robin in the fourth position.\n\nGiven these positions:\n- The raven is in the second position.\n- The robin is in the fourth position.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining positions:\n- Since the raven is second, the owl must be in the first position (to the left of the raven).\n- The robin is fourth, and it must be to the left of the crow, so the crow must be in the fifth position.\n- The only position left is the third position, which must be occupied by the cardinal.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is:\n1. Owl\n2. Raven\n3. Cardinal\n4. Robin\n5. Crow\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- (A) The owl is the third from the left: Incorrect, the owl is first.\n- (B) The crow is the third from the left: Incorrect, the crow is fifth.\n- (C) The raven is the third from the left: Incorrect, the raven is second.\n- (D) The robin is the third from the left: Incorrect, the robin is fourth.\n- (E) The cardinal is the third from the left: Correct, the cardinal is in the third position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
