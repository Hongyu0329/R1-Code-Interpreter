    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Joe finished second.**\n   - This means Joe is in the 2nd position.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Amy.**\n   - Since Joe is in the 2nd position, Amy must be in the 1st position because she is the only one who can be above Joe.\n\n3. **Mel finished second-to-last.**\n   - The second-to-last position is the 4th position. Therefore, Mel is in the 4th position.\n\n4. **Ada finished last.**\n   - The last position is the 5th position. Therefore, Ada is in the 5th position.\n\nNow, let's summarize the positions we have determined so far:\n- 1st: Amy\n- 2nd: Joe\n- 4th: Mel\n- 5th: Ada\n\nThe only position left is the 3rd position, which must be occupied by Rob.\n\nThus, the final order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n(A) Amy finished first\n(B) Mel finished first\n(C) Rob finished first\n(D) Joe finished first\n(E) Ada finished first\n\nBased on our analysis, Amy finished first. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Amy finished first"
