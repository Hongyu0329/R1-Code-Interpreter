    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The gray book is to the right of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the yellow book is somewhere to the left of the gray book.\n\n2. **The orange book is to the right of the red book.**\n   - This means the red book is somewhere to the left of the orange book.\n\n3. **The blue book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the blue book is in the fifth position.\n\n4. **The gray book is to the left of the red book.**\n   - This means the gray book is somewhere to the left of the red book.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the blue book is the rightmost, it is in position 5.\n- The gray book must be to the left of the red book, and the red book must be to the left of the orange book. Therefore, the order of these three books from left to right is: gray, red, orange.\n- The yellow book must be to the left of the gray book.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the books:\n\n1. **Position 1:** Yellow book (since it must be to the left of the gray book).\n2. **Position 2:** Gray book (since it must be to the left of the red book).\n3. **Position 3:** Red book (since it must be to the left of the orange book).\n4. **Position 4:** Orange book.\n5. **Position 5:** Blue book (as it is the rightmost).\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n- (A) The gray book is the second from the left: This is true based on our arrangement.\n- (B) The red book is the second from the left: This is false; the red book is third.\n- (C) The yellow book is the second from the left: This is false; the yellow book is first.\n- (D) The blue book is the second from the left: This is false; the blue book is fifth.\n- (E) The orange book is the second from the left: This is false; the orange book is fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
