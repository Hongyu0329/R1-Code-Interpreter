    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Joe finished second.**\n   - This means Joe is in the 2nd position.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Amy.**\n   - Since Joe is in the 2nd position, Amy must be in the 1st position.\n\n3. **Mel finished second-to-last.**\n   - The second-to-last position is the 4th position, so Mel is in the 4th position.\n\n4. **Ada finished last.**\n   - The last position is the 5th position, so Ada is in the 5th position.\n\nNow, let's determine the position of Rob. We have the following positions filled:\n- 1st: Amy\n- 2nd: Joe\n- 4th: Mel\n- 5th: Ada\n\nThe only position left is the 3rd position, so Rob must be in the 3rd position.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n(A) Amy finished second - Incorrect, Amy finished first.\n(B) Mel finished second - Incorrect, Mel finished fourth.\n(C) Rob finished second - Incorrect, Rob finished third.\n(D) Joe finished second - Correct, Joe finished second.\n(E) Ada finished second - Incorrect, Ada finished last.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
