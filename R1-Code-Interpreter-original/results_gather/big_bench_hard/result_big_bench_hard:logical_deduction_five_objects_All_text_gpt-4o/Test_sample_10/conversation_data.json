A fruit stand sells five fruits: kiwis, pears, peaches, loquats, and apples. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis. The pears are more expensive than the peaches. The apples are more expensive than the loquats. The apples are less expensive than the peaches.\nOptions:\n(A) The kiwis are the second-cheapest\n(B) The pears are the second-cheapest\n(C) The peaches are the second-cheapest\n(D) The loquats are the second-cheapest\n(E) The apples are the second-cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. \"The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\"\n   - This implies: kiwis < loquats\n\n2. \"The pears are more expensive than the peaches.\"\n   - This implies: peaches < pears\n\n3. \"The apples are more expensive than the loquats.\"\n   - This implies: loquats < apples\n\n4. \"The apples are less expensive than the peaches.\"\n   - This implies: apples < peaches\n\nNow, let's combine these inequalities to find the order:\n\n- From statement 1 and 3: kiwis < loquats < apples\n- From statement 4: apples < peaches\n- From statement 2: peaches < pears\n\nCombining all these, we get the following order:\nkiwis < loquats < apples < peaches < pears\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-cheapest:\n\n- The order is: kiwis, loquats, apples, peaches, pears\n- The second-cheapest fruit is loquats.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
