    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions and then identify which bird is second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze the given conditions step by step:\n\n1. **The owl is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the owl is in the first position.\n\n2. **The robin is to the left of the raven.**\n   - This means the robin must be placed somewhere before the raven.\n\n3. **The quail is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the quail is in the fifth position.\n\n4. **The raven is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the raven is in the third position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- **Position 1:** Owl (since the owl is the leftmost)\n- **Position 2:** Robin (since the robin is to the left of the raven)\n- **Position 3:** Raven (since the raven is the third from the left)\n- **Position 4:** Falcon (since the quail is the rightmost, the falcon must be in the remaining position)\n- **Position 5:** Quail (since the quail is the rightmost)\n\nNow, let's verify the positions:\n- Owl is indeed the leftmost.\n- Robin is to the left of the raven.\n- Raven is third from the left.\n- Quail is the rightmost.\n\nThe order of the birds is: Owl, Robin, Raven, Falcon, Quail.\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is second from the right:\n- The second from the right is the fourth position, which is occupied by the Falcon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
