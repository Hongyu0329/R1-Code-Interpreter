    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The sedan is the second-newest.**\n   - This means there is only one vehicle newer than the sedan.\n\n2. **The station wagon is newer than the convertible.**\n   - This implies that the convertible cannot be the newest, as the station wagon is newer.\n\n3. **The sedan is older than the motorcycle.**\n   - This means the motorcycle is newer than the sedan.\n\n4. **The bus is the oldest.**\n   - This places the bus at the end of the order.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the bus is the oldest, it is at the end of the list.\n- The sedan is the second-newest, so there is one vehicle newer than it.\n- The motorcycle is newer than the sedan, so the motorcycle must be the newest.\n- The station wagon is newer than the convertible, so the convertible cannot be the newest.\n- Therefore, the order from newest to oldest is: Motorcycle, Sedan, Station Wagon, Convertible, Bus.\n\nBased on this order, the motorcycle is the newest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
