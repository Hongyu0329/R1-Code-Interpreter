    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This implies: Watermelons > Cantaloupes\n\n2. **The mangoes are less expensive than the pears.**\n   - This implies: Mangoes < Pears\n\n3. **The apples are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This implies that there is only one fruit cheaper than apples.\n\n4. **The watermelons are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This implies: Watermelons < Mangoes\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine the order of the fruits:\n\n- From statement 3, since apples are the second-cheapest, there must be one fruit cheaper than apples. Let's denote this fruit as the cheapest.\n\n- From statement 1 and 4, we know:\n  - Watermelons > Cantaloupes\n  - Watermelons < Mangoes\n\n  Combining these, we can infer:\n  - Cantaloupes < Watermelons < Mangoes\n\n- From statement 2, we know:\n  - Mangoes < Pears\n\n  Combining this with the previous order, we get:\n  - Cantaloupes < Watermelons < Mangoes < Pears\n\n- Since apples are the second-cheapest, the order must be:\n  - Cheapest < Apples < Watermelons < Mangoes < Pears\n\n- The only fruit not mentioned yet is cantaloupes, which must be the cheapest because apples are the second-cheapest.\n\nThus, the final order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Apples\n3. Watermelons\n4. Mangoes\n5. Pears\n\nNow, we can determine which fruit is the third-most expensive:\n- The third-most expensive fruit is Watermelons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
