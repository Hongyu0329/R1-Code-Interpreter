    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the information given in the paragraph. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - This means: Watermelons > Loquats\n\n2. **The watermelons are less expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - This means: Kiwis > Watermelons\n\n3. **The loquats are more expensive than the apples.**\n   - This means: Loquats > Apples\n\n4. **The cantaloupes are the cheapest.**\n   - This means: Cantaloupes < all other fruits\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits in order from cheapest to most expensive using the above information:\n\n- From statement 4, we know that cantaloupes are the cheapest, so they must be at the beginning of the list.\n- From statement 3, we know that apples are cheaper than loquats.\n- From statement 1, we know that loquats are cheaper than watermelons.\n- From statement 2, we know that watermelons are cheaper than kiwis.\n\nPutting it all together, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Apples\n3. Loquats\n4. Watermelons\n5. Kiwis\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The apples are the cheapest - Incorrect, because cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n- (B) The loquats are the cheapest - Incorrect, because cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n- (C) The cantaloupes are the cheapest - Correct, as per our analysis.\n- (D) The watermelons are the cheapest - Incorrect, because cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n- (E) The kiwis are the cheapest - Incorrect, because cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
