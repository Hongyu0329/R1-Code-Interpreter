    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The blue jay is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the blue jay is in position 2.\n\n2. **The cardinal is to the right of the blue jay.**\n   - Since the blue jay is in position 2, the cardinal must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. **The robin is to the right of the cardinal.**\n   - This means the robin must be in a position further right than the cardinal. If the cardinal is in position 3, the robin could be in position 4 or 5. If the cardinal is in position 4, the robin must be in position 5.\n\n4. **The crow is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the crow is in position 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the positions:\n\n- **Position 1:** Since the blue jay is in position 2, and the cardinal is to the right of the blue jay, the only bird that can be in position 1 is the falcon.\n\n- **Position 2:** Blue jay (as given).\n\n- **Position 3:** The cardinal must be here because the robin is to the right of the cardinal, and the crow is the rightmost.\n\n- **Position 4:** The robin must be here because the crow is the rightmost.\n\n- **Position 5:** The crow (as given).\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: Falcon, Blue Jay, Cardinal, Robin, Crow.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The cardinal is the rightmost - Incorrect, the cardinal is in position 3.\n(B) The crow is the rightmost - Correct, the crow is in position 5.\n(C) The falcon is the rightmost - Incorrect, the falcon is in position 1.\n(D) The robin is the rightmost - Incorrect, the robin is in position 4.\n(E) The blue jay is the rightmost - Incorrect, the blue jay is in position 2.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
