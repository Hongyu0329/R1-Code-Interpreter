    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the first position.\n\n2. **The blue jay is the third from the left.**\n   - Since the cardinal is in the first position, the blue jay must be in the third position.\n\n3. **The raven is to the right of the blue jay.**\n   - The blue jay is in the third position, so the raven must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n\n4. **The robin is to the right of the raven.**\n   - This means the robin must be in a position to the right of the raven. If the raven is in the fourth position, the robin must be in the fifth position.\n\n5. **Determine the position of the quail.**\n   - The cardinal is in the first position, the blue jay is in the third position, and the raven and robin occupy the fourth and fifth positions, respectively. Therefore, the quail must be in the second position.\n\nNow, let's list the positions of the birds:\n1. Cardinal\n2. Quail\n3. Blue Jay\n4. Raven\n5. Robin\n\nFrom this arrangement, we can see that the robin is the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n<<<B>>>"
