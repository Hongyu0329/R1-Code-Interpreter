    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The peaches are more expensive than the oranges.\n2. The cantaloupes are more expensive than the peaches.\n3. The kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n4. The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- From statement 1, we know: Oranges < Peaches.\n- From statement 2, we know: Peaches < Cantaloupes.\n- From statement 3, we know: Kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n- From statement 4, we know: Loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these statements:\n\n- Since loquats are the second-cheapest, they cannot be the most expensive. This rules out option (D).\n- Since kiwis are the third-most expensive, they cannot be the most expensive. This rules out option (E).\n- The order of the fruits based on the given information is:\n  1. Cheapest: Oranges\n  2. Second-cheapest: Loquats\n  3. Third-most expensive: Kiwis\n  4. Fourth-most expensive: Peaches\n  5. Most expensive: Cantaloupes\n\nBased on this order, the cantaloupes are the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
