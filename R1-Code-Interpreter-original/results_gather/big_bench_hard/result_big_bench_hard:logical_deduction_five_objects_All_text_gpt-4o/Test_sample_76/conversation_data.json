    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The owl is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the owl is in the fourth position from the left.\n\n2. **The robin is the second from the left.**\n   - This places the robin in the second position from the left.\n\n3. **The robin is to the right of the blue jay.**\n   - Since the robin is in the second position, the blue jay must be in the first position.\n\n4. **The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.**\n   - This means the hawk must be to the left of the hummingbird.\n\nNow, let's place the birds in order based on these conditions:\n\n- The blue jay is in the first position.\n- The robin is in the second position.\n- The owl is in the fourth position.\n\nThis leaves the third and fifth positions for the hawk and the hummingbird. Since the hummingbird is to the right of the hawk, the hawk must be in the third position, and the hummingbird must be in the fifth position.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Owl\n5. Hummingbird\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The owl is the third from the left - Incorrect, the owl is fourth from the left.\n(B) The robin is the third from the left - Incorrect, the robin is second from the left.\n(C) The blue jay is the third from the left - Incorrect, the blue jay is first from the left.\n(D) The hawk is the third from the left - Correct, the hawk is indeed third from the left.\n(E) The hummingbird is the third from the left - Incorrect, the hummingbird is fifth from the left.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
