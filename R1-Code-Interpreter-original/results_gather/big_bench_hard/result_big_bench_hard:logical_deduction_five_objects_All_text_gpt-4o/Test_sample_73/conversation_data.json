    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The sedan is newer than the station wagon.**\n   - This means the station wagon is older than the sedan.\n\n2. **The limousine is the newest.**\n   - This places the limousine at the end of the order (newest).\n\n3. **The bus is the second-newest.**\n   - This places the bus just before the limousine in the order.\n\n4. **The convertible is the second-oldest.**\n   - This places the convertible just after the oldest vehicle.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the limousine is the newest, it is in the 5th position.\n- The bus, being the second-newest, is in the 4th position.\n- The convertible is the second-oldest, so it is in the 2nd position.\n- The sedan is newer than the station wagon, so the station wagon must be the oldest, and the sedan is in the 3rd position.\n\nArranging them from oldest to newest, we have:\n1. Station wagon (oldest)\n2. Convertible\n3. Sedan\n4. Bus\n5. Limousine (newest)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The convertible is the newest - Incorrect, as the convertible is the second-oldest.\n(B) The sedan is the newest - Incorrect, as the sedan is in the middle.\n(C) The station wagon is the newest - Incorrect, as the station wagon is the oldest.\n(D) The bus is the newest - Incorrect, as the bus is the second-newest.\n(E) The limousine is the newest - Correct, as per the given statement.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
