    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Mya finished first.**\n   - This means Mya is in the 1st position.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Dan.**\n   - Joe's position is lower than Dan's position.\n\n3. **Dan finished below Rob.**\n   - Dan's position is lower than Rob's position.\n\n4. **Eve finished above Rob.**\n   - Eve's position is higher than Rob's position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- Since Mya is 1st, we have: Mya, _, _, _, _.\n\n- Eve must be above Rob, so Eve cannot be 4th or 5th. The only positions available for Eve are 2nd or 3rd.\n\n- Dan must be below Rob, so Dan cannot be 2nd or 3rd. The only positions available for Dan are 4th or 5th.\n\n- Joe must be below Dan, so Joe cannot be 4th. The only position available for Joe is 5th.\n\nLet's try to fill in the positions:\n\n- Mya is 1st.\n- Eve must be 2nd or 3rd.\n- Rob must be above Dan, so Rob can be 2nd or 3rd.\n- Dan must be below Rob, so Dan can be 4th.\n- Joe must be below Dan, so Joe is 5th.\n\nNow, let's place Eve and Rob:\n\n- If Eve is 2nd, then Rob must be 3rd, and Dan is 4th.\n- If Eve is 3rd, then Rob must be 2nd, and Dan is 4th.\n\nBoth scenarios satisfy all conditions, but in both cases, Joe is 5th.\n\nTherefore, Joe finished second-to-last, which is 4th place.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
