    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The apples are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means apples are priced higher than oranges.\n\n2. **The oranges are more expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This means oranges are priced higher than mangoes.\n\n3. **The apples are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This places apples in the third position when ordered by price.\n\n4. **The pears are more expensive than the watermelons.**\n   - This means pears are priced higher than watermelons.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine the order of the fruits:\n\n- Since apples are the third-most expensive, there are two fruits more expensive than apples and two fruits less expensive than apples.\n- From statement 1, apples are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be in the top two positions.\n- From statement 2, oranges are more expensive than mangoes, so mangoes cannot be in the top three positions.\n- From statement 4, pears are more expensive than watermelons, so watermelons cannot be in the top four positions.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the fruits in order:\n\n- **Position 1 (Most expensive):** Since apples are third, and pears are more expensive than watermelons, pears could be the most expensive.\n- **Position 2:** The only fruit that can be more expensive than apples and less expensive than pears is oranges.\n- **Position 3:** Apples, as given.\n- **Position 4:** Since oranges are more expensive than mangoes, and apples are more expensive than oranges, mangoes must be less expensive than apples, placing mangoes here.\n- **Position 5 (Least expensive):** Watermelons, since pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nThus, the order from most expensive to least expensive is: Pears, Oranges, Apples, Mangoes, Watermelons.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The apples are the most expensive - Incorrect, apples are third.\n(B) The oranges are the most expensive - Incorrect, oranges are second.\n(C) The watermelons are the most expensive - Incorrect, watermelons are last.\n(D) The pears are the most expensive - Correct, pears are first.\n(E) The mangoes are the most expensive - Incorrect, mangoes are fourth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
