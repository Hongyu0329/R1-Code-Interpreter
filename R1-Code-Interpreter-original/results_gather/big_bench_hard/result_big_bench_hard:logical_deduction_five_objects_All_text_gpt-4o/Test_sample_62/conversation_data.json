    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Books on the shelf**: Green, Blue, White, Purple, Yellow.\n\n2. **Condition 1**: The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n   - This means the yellow book is somewhere to the left of the blue book.\n\n3. **Condition 2**: The white book is to the left of the yellow book.\n   - This means the white book is somewhere to the left of the yellow book.\n\n4. **Condition 3**: The blue book is the second from the right.\n   - This means the blue book is in the fourth position from the left.\n\n5. **Condition 4**: The purple book is the second from the left.\n   - This means the purple book is in the second position from the left.\n\nNow, let's arrange the books based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the blue book is second from the right, it is in position 4.\n- The purple book is second from the left, so it is in position 2.\n\nThe arrangement so far is: _ , Purple, _ , Blue, _\n\n- The white book must be to the left of the yellow book, and both must be to the left of the blue book. Therefore, the white book cannot be in position 3 (as it would not leave room for the yellow book to be to its right and still to the left of the blue book). Thus, the white book must be in position 1.\n\nThe arrangement now is: White, Purple, _ , Blue, _\n\n- The yellow book must be to the left of the blue book, so it must be in position 3.\n\nThe arrangement now is: White, Purple, Yellow, Blue, _\n\n- The only remaining book, the green book, must be in position 5.\n\nThe final arrangement is: White, Purple, Yellow, Blue, Green\n\nNow, let's determine which book is third from the left:\n\n- The book in the third position from the left is the Yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
