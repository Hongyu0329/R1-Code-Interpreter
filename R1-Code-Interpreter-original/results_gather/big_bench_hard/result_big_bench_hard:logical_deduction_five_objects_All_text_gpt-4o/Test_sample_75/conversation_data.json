    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, from cheapest to most expensive, using the given statements:\n\n1. The mangoes are more expensive than the loquats.\n2. The cantaloupes are more expensive than the mangoes.\n3. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n4. The pears are the cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- Since the pears are the cheapest, they must be in the first position.\n- The mangoes are more expensive than the loquats, so the loquats must be cheaper than the mangoes.\n- The cantaloupes are more expensive than the mangoes, so the mangoes must be cheaper than the cantaloupes.\n- The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes, so the cantaloupes must be cheaper than the watermelons.\n\nBased on these statements, we can establish the following order from cheapest to most expensive:\n\n1. Pears\n2. Loquats\n3. Mangoes\n4. Cantaloupes\n5. Watermelons\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-cheapest:\n\n- The first position is occupied by the pears.\n- The second position is occupied by the loquats.\n\nTherefore, the loquats are the second-cheapest fruit.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
