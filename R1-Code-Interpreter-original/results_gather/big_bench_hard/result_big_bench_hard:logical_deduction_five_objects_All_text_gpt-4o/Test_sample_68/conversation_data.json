    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The sedan is the second-newest.**\n   - This means there is only one vehicle newer than the sedan.\n\n2. **The station wagon is newer than the convertible.**\n   - This implies that the convertible cannot be the newest, as the station wagon is newer.\n\n3. **The sedan is older than the motorcycle.**\n   - This means the motorcycle is newer than the sedan.\n\n4. **The bus is the oldest.**\n   - This directly tells us that the bus is the oldest vehicle.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the bus is the oldest, it is in the first position.\n- The sedan is the second-newest, so it is in the fourth position.\n- The motorcycle is newer than the sedan, so it is in the fifth position (newest).\n- The station wagon is newer than the convertible, so the convertible must be in the third position, and the station wagon in the second position.\n\nArranging them from oldest to newest, we have:\n1. Bus (oldest)\n2. Station wagon\n3. Convertible\n4. Sedan\n5. Motorcycle (newest)\n\nBased on the options provided, the correct answer is:\n(D) The bus is the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
