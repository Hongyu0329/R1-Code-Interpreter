    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The brown book is the second from the left.**\n   - This gives us a fixed position for the brown book: it is in the second position.\n\n2. **The red book is to the left of the brown book.**\n   - Since the brown book is second, the red book must be in the first position.\n\n3. **The yellow book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book must be to the left of the yellow book.\n\n4. **The yellow book is to the left of the blue book.**\n   - This means the yellow book must be to the left of the blue book.\n\nNow, let's place the books based on these conditions:\n\n- We know the red book is first and the brown book is second.\n- The orange book must be to the left of the yellow book, and the yellow book must be to the left of the blue book.\n- The remaining positions are third, fourth, and fifth.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only way to arrange the remaining books (orange, yellow, blue) is:\n- Orange book in the third position\n- Yellow book in the fourth position\n- Blue book in the fifth position\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is:\n1. Red book\n2. Brown book\n3. Orange book\n4. Yellow book\n5. Blue book\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect, the blue book is fifth.\n(B) The red book is the second from the left - Incorrect, the red book is first.\n(C) The brown book is the second from the left - Correct, the brown book is second.\n(D) The yellow book is the second from the left - Incorrect, the yellow book is fourth.\n(E) The orange book is the second from the left - Incorrect, the orange book is third.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
