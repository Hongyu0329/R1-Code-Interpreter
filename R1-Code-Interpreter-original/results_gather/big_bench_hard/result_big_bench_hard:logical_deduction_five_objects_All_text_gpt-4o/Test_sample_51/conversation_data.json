    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The purple book is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the purple book is in position 3.\n\n2. **The yellow book is to the left of the black book.**\n   - This means the yellow book must be in a position to the left of the black book.\n\n3. **The green book is to the left of the purple book.**\n   - Since the purple book is in position 3, the green book must be in position 1 or 2.\n\n4. **The blue book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the blue book must be in a position to the left of the green book.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books in order:\n\n- Since the purple book is in position 3, the possible positions for the green book are 1 or 2.\n- The blue book must be to the left of the green book, so if the green book is in position 2, the blue book must be in position 1.\n- If the green book is in position 1, there is no position for the blue book to be to the left of it, so the green book must be in position 2 and the blue book in position 1.\n\nNow we have:\n1. Blue book\n2. Green book\n3. Purple book\n\n- The yellow book must be to the left of the black book. The only remaining positions are 4 and 5.\n- Therefore, the yellow book must be in position 4 and the black book in position 5.\n\nThe final order of the books is:\n1. Blue book\n2. Green book\n3. Purple book\n4. Yellow book\n5. Black book\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n(A) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's first.\n(B) The purple book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's third.\n(C) The yellow book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's fourth.\n(D) The black book is the second from the left - Incorrect, it's fifth.\n(E) The green book is the second from the left - Correct, it is indeed second.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
