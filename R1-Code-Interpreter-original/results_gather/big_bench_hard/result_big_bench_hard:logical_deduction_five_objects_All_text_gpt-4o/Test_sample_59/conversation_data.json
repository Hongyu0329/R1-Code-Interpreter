    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The limousine is the newest.**\n   - This means the limousine is at the end of the order.\n\n2. **The bus is the second-oldest.**\n   - This places the bus in the second position from the start.\n\n3. **The tractor is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is older than the tractor.\n\n4. **The hatchback is newer than the sedan.**\n   - This means the sedan is older than the hatchback.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- Since the limousine is the newest, it is in the last position.\n- The bus is the second-oldest, so it is in the second position.\n- The sedan must be older than the hatchback, so the sedan is before the hatchback.\n- The tractor is newer than the hatchback, so the tractor is after the hatchback.\n\nGiven these conditions, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Oldest: Sedan\n2. Second-oldest: Bus\n3. Middle: Hatchback\n4. Second-newest: Tractor\n5. Newest: Limousine\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the bus is indeed the second-oldest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
