    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The orange book is to the right of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the yellow book is positioned somewhere to the left of the orange book.\n\n2. **The green book is the rightmost.**\n   - The green book is in the fifth position from the left.\n\n3. **The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.**\n   - This means the blue book is positioned somewhere to the left of the yellow book.\n\n4. **The orange book is the third from the left.**\n   - This places the orange book in the third position.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the orange book is third from the left, the positions are as follows:\n  1. [First]\n  2. [Second]\n  3. Orange\n  4. [Fourth]\n  5. Green (rightmost)\n\n- The yellow book must be to the left of the orange book, so it can only be in the first or second position.\n\n- The blue book must be to the left of the yellow book, so it must be in the first position if the yellow book is in the second position.\n\n- The brown book is the only book not yet placed, so it must be in the remaining position.\n\nLet's try placing the yellow book in the second position:\n- 1st: Blue\n- 2nd: Yellow\n- 3rd: Orange\n- 4th: Brown\n- 5th: Green\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n- The orange book is to the right of the yellow book.\n- The green book is the rightmost.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n- The orange book is the third from the left.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n(A) The green book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n(B) The orange book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n(C) The brown book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n(D) The yellow book is the second from the left - Correct\n(E) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
