    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Mel finished first.**\n   - This directly tells us that Mel is in the first position.\n\n2. **Amy finished below Dan.**\n   - This means Dan finished in a higher position than Amy.\n\n3. **Joe finished above Dan.**\n   - This means Joe finished in a higher position than Dan.\n\n4. **Eve finished last.**\n   - This tells us that Eve is in the fifth position.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine the order:\n\n- Since Mel finished first, Mel is in position 1.\n- Eve finished last, so Eve is in position 5.\n- Joe finished above Dan, and Dan finished above Amy. Therefore, Joe must be in a higher position than both Dan and Amy.\n- The only positions left for Joe, Dan, and Amy are 2, 3, and 4.\n- Since Joe is above Dan, Joe cannot be in position 4. Therefore, Joe must be in position 2 or 3.\n- Since Dan is above Amy, Dan cannot be in position 4. Therefore, Dan must be in position 2 or 3.\n- The only position left for Amy is position 4.\n\nGiven these constraints, the only possible order is:\n1. Mel\n2. Joe\n3. Dan\n4. Amy\n5. Eve\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Mel finished first: This is consistent with our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
