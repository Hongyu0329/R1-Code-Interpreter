    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The convertible is newer than the truck.**\n   - This means the convertible is not the oldest, and the truck is not the newest.\n\n2. **The minivan is the newest.**\n   - This directly tells us that the minivan is at the top of the list (newest).\n\n3. **The bus is the third-newest.**\n   - This places the bus in the third position when ordered from newest to oldest.\n\n4. **The truck is newer than the sedan.**\n   - This means the truck is not the oldest, and the sedan is not the newest.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- The minivan is the newest, so it is in the first position.\n- The bus is the third-newest, so it is in the third position.\n- The convertible is newer than the truck, so the convertible must be in a position before the truck.\n- The truck is newer than the sedan, so the truck must be in a position before the sedan.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the vehicles:\n\n1. Minivan (newest)\n2. Convertible\n3. Bus\n4. Truck\n5. Sedan (oldest)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:\n- The minivan is the newest.\n- The bus is the third-newest.\n- The convertible is newer than the truck.\n- The truck is newer than the sedan.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The convertible is the newest - Incorrect, because the minivan is the newest.\n(B) The bus is the newest - Incorrect, because the minivan is the newest.\n(C) The minivan is the newest - Correct, as per the given statement.\n(D) The truck is the newest - Incorrect, because the minivan is the newest.\n(E) The sedan is the newest - Incorrect, because the minivan is the newest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
