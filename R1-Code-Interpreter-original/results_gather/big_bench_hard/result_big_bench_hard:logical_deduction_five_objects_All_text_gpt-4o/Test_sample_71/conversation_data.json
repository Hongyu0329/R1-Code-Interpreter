A fruit stand sells five fruits: oranges, apples, peaches, cantaloupes, and loquats. The loquats are less expensive than the cantaloupes. The cantaloupes are less expensive than the apples. The oranges are the most expensive. The apples are the third-most expensive.\nOptions:\n(A) The oranges are the second-cheapest\n(B) The apples are the second-cheapest\n(C) The peaches are the second-cheapest\n(D) The cantaloupes are the second-cheapest\n(E) The loquats are the second-cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, from most expensive to least expensive, using the given information:\n\n1. **Oranges are the most expensive.**\n   - This means oranges are at the top of the list.\n\n2. **Apples are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This places apples in the third position.\n\n3. **Loquats are less expensive than cantaloupes.**\n   - This means loquats are below cantaloupes in the order.\n\n4. **Cantaloupes are less expensive than apples.**\n   - This places cantaloupes below apples.\n\nGiven these points, let's arrange the fruits:\n\n- **1st (Most Expensive):** Oranges\n- **2nd:** Cantaloupes (since they are less expensive than apples but more expensive than loquats)\n- **3rd:** Apples\n- **4th:** Peaches (since they are not mentioned in the constraints, they can be placed here)\n- **5th (Least Expensive):** Loquats\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-cheapest:\n\n- The order from least to most expensive is: Loquats, Peaches, Apples, Cantaloupes, Oranges.\n- Therefore, the second-cheapest fruit is Peaches.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
