    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The tractor is newer than the minivan.**\n   - This means the minivan is older than the tractor.\n\n2. **The tractor is older than the limousine.**\n   - This means the limousine is newer than the tractor.\n\n3. **The convertible is older than the sedan.**\n   - This means the sedan is newer than the convertible.\n\n4. **The convertible is the second-newest.**\n   - This means there is only one vehicle newer than the convertible.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to determine the order:\n\n- From statement 4, since the convertible is the second-newest, there must be one vehicle newer than it. This means the convertible cannot be the newest, and it cannot be the oldest because there are vehicles older than it.\n\n- From statement 3, the sedan is newer than the convertible. Since the convertible is the second-newest, the sedan must be the newest.\n\n- From statements 1 and 2, we know the order of the tractor, minivan, and limousine:\n  - The minivan is older than the tractor.\n  - The tractor is older than the limousine.\n  - Therefore, the order from oldest to newest among these three is: minivan, tractor, limousine.\n\nNow, let's place all vehicles in order from oldest to newest:\n\n1. Minivan (oldest)\n2. Tractor\n3. Limousine\n4. Convertible (second-newest)\n5. Sedan (newest)\n\nBased on this order, the oldest vehicle is the minivan.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
