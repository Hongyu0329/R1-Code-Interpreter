    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the five golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Ada finished above Eli.**\n   - This means Ada's position is better (numerically lower) than Eli's.\n\n2. **Amy finished below Mel.**\n   - This means Amy's position is worse (numerically higher) than Mel's.\n\n3. **Ada finished second.**\n   - This gives us a fixed position for Ada: 2nd place.\n\n4. **Mel finished below Eli.**\n   - This means Mel's position is worse (numerically higher) than Eli's.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the positions:\n\n- Since Ada is 2nd, we have: \n  - 1st: Unknown\n  - 2nd: Ada\n  - 3rd: Unknown\n  - 4th: Unknown\n  - 5th: Unknown\n\n- Ada finished above Eli, so Eli cannot be 1st. Eli must be 3rd, 4th, or 5th.\n\n- Mel finished below Eli, so Mel must be in a position worse than Eli's. Therefore, Mel cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd if Eli is 3rd. Mel must be 4th or 5th.\n\n- Amy finished below Mel, so Amy must be in a position worse than Mel's. Therefore, Amy cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th if Mel is 4th. Amy must be 5th.\n\nLet's try to place Eli and Mel:\n\n- If Eli is 3rd, then Mel must be 4th, and Amy must be 5th. This satisfies all conditions:\n  - Ada is 2nd.\n  - Eli is 3rd.\n  - Mel is 4th.\n  - Amy is 5th.\n  - Joe must be 1st because he is the only one left.\n\nThis order satisfies all the given conditions:\n- Ada finished above Eli (2nd vs. 3rd).\n- Amy finished below Mel (5th vs. 4th).\n- Ada finished second.\n- Mel finished below Eli (4th vs. 3rd).\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Eli finished third.\n\n<<<B>>>"
