Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) enormous new triangular Nigerian lead cat\n- enormous: size\n- new: age\n- triangular: shape\n- Nigerian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- lead: material\n\n(B) enormous Nigerian triangular new lead cat\n- enormous: size\n- Nigerian: proper adjective (nationality)\n- triangular: shape\n- new: age\n- lead: material\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: size, age, shape, proper adjective, material. \n\nOption (A) follows this order: size (enormous), age (new), shape (triangular), proper adjective (Nigerian), material (lead).\n\nOption (B) does not follow the correct order because it places the proper adjective (Nigerian) before the age (new).\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
