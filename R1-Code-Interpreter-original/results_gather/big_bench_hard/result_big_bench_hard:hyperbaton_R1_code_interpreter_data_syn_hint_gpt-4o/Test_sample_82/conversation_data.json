    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) lovely ancient triangular orange Turkish wood smoking shoe\n- lovely (opinion)\n- ancient (age)\n- triangular (shape)\n- orange (color)\n- Turkish (proper adjective)\n- wood (material)\n- smoking (purpose)\n\n(B) Turkish wood smoking lovely orange ancient triangular shoe\n- Turkish (proper adjective)\n- wood (material)\n- smoking (purpose)\n- lovely (opinion)\n- orange (color)\n- ancient (age)\n- triangular (shape)\n\nComparing both options with the standard order, option (A) follows the correct sequence of adjectives:\n\n1. Opinion: lovely\n2. Age: ancient\n3. Shape: triangular\n4. Color: orange\n5. Proper adjective: Turkish\n6. Material: wood\n7. Purpose: smoking\n\nOption (B) does not follow the standard order, as it starts with the proper adjective and material, which should come later in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
