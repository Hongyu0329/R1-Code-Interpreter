Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) medium-size Filipino old-fashioned ship\n- \"medium-size\" is a size adjective.\n- \"Filipino\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age adjective.\n\n(B) medium-size old-fashioned Filipino ship\n- \"medium-size\" is a size adjective.\n- \"old-fashioned\" is an age adjective.\n- \"Filipino\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nAccording to the adjective order rule, the correct sequence should be size, age, and then proper adjective.
