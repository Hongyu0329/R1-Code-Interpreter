Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) silver new repulsive exercise green Pakistani computer\n- silver (color)\n- new (age)\n- repulsive (opinion)\n- exercise (purpose)\n- green (color)\n- Pakistani (proper adjective)\n\n(B) repulsive new green Pakistani silver exercise computer\n- repulsive (opinion)\n- new (age)\n- green (color)\n- Pakistani (proper adjective)\n- silver (color)\n- exercise (purpose)\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: opinion, age, color, proper adjective, and purpose. \n\nOption (B) follows this order more closely:\n- Opinion: repulsive\n- Age: new\n- Color: green\n- Proper adjective: Pakistani\n- Color: silver\n- Purpose: exercise\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct sentence with the proper adjective order.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
