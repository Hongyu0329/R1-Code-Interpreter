    "To determine the correct adjective order in English, we follow a specific sequence: \n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) tiny whittling grey brand-new Indian triangular dog\n- tiny (size)\n- whittling (not a standard adjective, possibly a verb form)\n- grey (color)\n- brand-new (age)\n- Indian (proper adjective)\n- triangular (shape)\n\n(B) tiny brand-new triangular grey Indian whittling dog\n- tiny (size)\n- brand-new (age)\n- triangular (shape)\n- grey (color)\n- Indian (proper adjective)\n- whittling (not a standard adjective, possibly a verb form)\n\nAccording to the standard order, the correct sequence should be: size, age, shape, color, proper adjective. \n\nOption (B) follows this order more closely than option (A), except for the \"whittling\" part, which is not a standard adjective and seems out of place in both options. However, ignoring \"whittling,\" option (B) aligns with the standard adjective order.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) tiny brand-new triangular grey Indian whittling dog"
