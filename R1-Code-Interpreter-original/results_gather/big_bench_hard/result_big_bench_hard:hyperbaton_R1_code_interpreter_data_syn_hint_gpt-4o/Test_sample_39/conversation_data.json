    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the general rule for the order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"new\" and \"green.\" According to the order:\n\n- \"New\" is an adjective of age.\n- \"Green\" is an adjective of color.\n\nAccording to the adjective order rule, adjectives of age should come before adjectives of color. Therefore, the correct order is:\n\n(B) new green chair\n\nThus, the correct sentence is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
