    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the general rules for the order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"whittling\" and \"Nigerian.\" \n\n- \"Whittling\" is a participle adjective that describes the purpose or function of the noun \"computer.\"\n- \"Nigerian\" is a proper adjective that indicates the origin or nationality.\n\nAccording to the adjective order rules, the proper adjective (nationality) should come before the purpose or qualifier adjective. Therefore, the correct order should be:\n\n(B) Nigerian whittling computer\n\nThus, the correct sentence is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
