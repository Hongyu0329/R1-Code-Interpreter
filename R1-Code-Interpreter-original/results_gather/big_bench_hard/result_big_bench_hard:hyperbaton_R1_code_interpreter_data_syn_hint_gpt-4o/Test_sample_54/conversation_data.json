    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the general rule for the order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have the adjectives \"terrible,\" \"old-fashioned,\" and \"Turkish.\" Let's categorize them according to the order:\n\n- \"Terrible\" is an opinion or quality.\n- \"Old-fashioned\" refers to age.\n- \"Turkish\" is a proper adjective (nationality).\n\nAccording to the order, the correct sequence should be: opinion/quality, age, proper adjective. Therefore, the correct order is:\n\n(A) terrible old-fashioned Turkish baby\n\nOption (B) \"old-fashioned terrible Turkish baby\" does not follow the correct adjective order because it places the age adjective before the opinion/quality adjective.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
