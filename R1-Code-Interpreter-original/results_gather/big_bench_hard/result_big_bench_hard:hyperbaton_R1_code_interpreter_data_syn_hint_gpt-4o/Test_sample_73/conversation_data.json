    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)\n8. Purpose or qualifier\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"old\" and \"drinking.\" \n\n- \"Old\" is an adjective that describes age.\n- \"Drinking\" is a purpose or qualifier adjective, as it describes the monkey's activity or function.\n\nAccording to the standard order, adjectives describing age should come before adjectives describing purpose or qualifier. Therefore, the correct order should be \"old drinking monkey.\"\n\nThus, the correct sentence is option (B) \"old drinking monkey.\"\n\n<<<answer>>>"
