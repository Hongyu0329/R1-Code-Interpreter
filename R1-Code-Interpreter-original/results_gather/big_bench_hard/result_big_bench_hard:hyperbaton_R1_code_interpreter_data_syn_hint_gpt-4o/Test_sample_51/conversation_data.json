    "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the standard order of adjectives in English. The typical order is:\n\n1. Quantity or number\n2. Quality or opinion\n3. Size\n4. Age\n5. Shape\n6. Color\n7. Origin\n8. Material\n9. Purpose\n\nIn the given options, we have two adjectives: \"green\" (color) and \"wool\" (material).
