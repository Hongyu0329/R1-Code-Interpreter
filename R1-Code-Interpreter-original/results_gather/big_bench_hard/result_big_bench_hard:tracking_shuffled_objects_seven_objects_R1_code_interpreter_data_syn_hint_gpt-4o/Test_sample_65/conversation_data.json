    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the balls as the players swap them. We will follow the sequence of swaps and determine which ball Alice ends up with.\n\n1. **Initial Ball Distribution:**\n   - Alice: Black\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Red\n   - Dave: Purple\n   - Eve: Pink\n   - Fred: Brown\n   - Gertrude: White\n\n2. **Swaps:**\n   - Fred and Gertrude swap: \n     - Fred: White\n     - Gertrude: Brown\n   - Fred and Alice swap:\n     - Fred: Black\n     - Alice: White\n   - Alice and Claire swap:\n     - Alice: Red\n     - Claire: White\n   - Bob and Dave swap:\n     - Bob: Purple\n     - Dave: Blue\n   - Fred and Eve swap:\n     - Fred: Pink\n     - Eve: Black\n   - Gertrude and Fred swap:\n     - Gertrude: Pink\n     - Fred: Brown\n   - Gertrude and Bob swap:\n     - Gertrude: Purple\n     - Bob: Pink\n\nNow, let's determine which ball Alice has at the end of the game. After following the swaps, Alice ends up with the red ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
