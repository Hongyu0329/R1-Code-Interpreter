    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the presents as they are swapped among the participants. We will follow the sequence of swaps and determine which present Bob ends up with.\n\n1. **Initial Distribution:**\n   - Alice: Blue\n   - Bob: Yellow\n   - Claire: Red\n   - Dave: Black\n   - Eve: White\n   - Fred: Brown\n   - Gertrude: Orange\n\n2. **Swaps:**\n   - **Alice and Fred swap:** \n     - Alice: Brown\n     - Fred: Blue\n   - **Claire and Bob swap:** \n     - Claire: Yellow\n     - Bob: Red\n   - **Dave and Fred swap:** \n     - Dave: Blue\n     - Fred: Black\n   - **Eve and Alice swap:** \n     - Eve: Brown\n     - Alice: White\n   - **Bob and Alice swap:** \n     - Bob: White\n     - Alice: Red\n   - **Eve and Gertrude swap:** \n     - Eve: Orange\n     - Gertrude: Brown\n   - **Fred and Alice swap:** \n     - Fred: Red\n     - Alice: Black\n\nAfter all the swaps, we need to determine what Bob is holding. Let's track Bob's present through the swaps:\n\n- Initially, Bob has the Yellow present.\n- After swapping with Claire, Bob has the Red present.\n- After swapping with Alice, Bob has the White present.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the event, Bob has the White present.\n\nThe correct option is (E) white present.\n\n<<<E>>>"
