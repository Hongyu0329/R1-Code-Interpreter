    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are swapped among the friends. We will start by listing the initial ownership of the books and then apply each swap in sequence to determine the final ownership.\n\nInitial ownership:\n- Alice: The Pearl\n- Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring\n- Claire: Catch-22\n- Dave: The Great Gatsby\n- Eve: Frankenstein\n- Fred: Ulysses\n- Gertrude: The Odyssey\n\nLet's apply the swaps step by step:\n\n1. Gertrude and Bob swap books:\n   - Gertrude: The Fellowship of the Ring\n   - Bob: The Odyssey\n\n2. Alice and Fred swap books:\n   - Alice: Ulysses\n   - Fred: The Pearl\n\n3. Gertrude and Claire swap books:\n   - Gertrude: Catch-22\n   - Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\n4. Fred and Eve swap books:\n   - Fred: Frankenstein\n   - Eve: The Pearl\n\n5. Claire and Dave swap books:\n   - Claire: The Great Gatsby\n   - Dave: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\n6. Eve and Bob swap books:\n   - Eve: The Odyssey\n   - Bob: The Pearl\n\n7. Fred and Gertrude swap books:\n   - Fred: Catch-22\n   - Gertrude: Frankenstein\n\nAfter all the swaps, we need to determine which book Bob has. According to the swaps, Bob ends up with \"The Pearl.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
