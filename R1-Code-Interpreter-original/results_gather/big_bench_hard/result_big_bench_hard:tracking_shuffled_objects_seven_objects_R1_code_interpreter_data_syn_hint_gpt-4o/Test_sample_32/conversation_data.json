    "To solve this problem, we need to track the position changes of each player as they swap positions according to the given sequence of swaps. We will start by listing the initial positions and then apply each swap step by step.\n\nInitial positions:\n- Alice: benchwarmer\n- Bob: striker\n- Claire: right winger\n- Dave: center midfielder\n- Eve: cheerleader\n- Fred: left winger\n- Gertrude: goalkeeper\n\nNow, let's apply the swaps:\n\n1. Eve and Alice trade positions:\n   - Alice: cheerleader\n   - Eve: benchwarmer\n\n2. Alice and Fred trade positions:\n   - Alice: left winger\n   - Fred: cheerleader\n\n3. Alice and Gertrude trade positions:\n   - Alice: goalkeeper\n   - Gertrude: left winger\n\n4. Bob and Eve trade positions:\n   - Bob: benchwarmer\n   - Eve: striker\n\n5. Alice and Bob trade positions:\n   - Alice: benchwarmer\n   - Bob: goalkeeper\n\n6. Eve and Claire trade positions:\n   - Eve: right winger\n   - Claire: striker\n\n7. Alice and Dave trade positions:\n   - Alice: center midfielder\n   - Dave: benchwarmer\n\nAt the end of the match, we need to determine Gertrude's position.
