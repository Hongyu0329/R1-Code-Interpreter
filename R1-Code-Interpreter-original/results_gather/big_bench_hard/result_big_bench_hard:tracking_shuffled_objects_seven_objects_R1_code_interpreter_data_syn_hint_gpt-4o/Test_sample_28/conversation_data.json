    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Lola\n- Bob with Helga\n- Claire with Sam\n- Dave with Melissa\n- Eve with Jamie\n- Fred with Rodrigo\n- Gertrude with Patrick\n\nNow, let's apply the partner switches:\n\n1. **Dave and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Dave with Sam\n   - Claire with Melissa\n\n2. **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Gertrude with Melissa\n   - Claire with Patrick\n\n3. **Claire and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Claire with Jamie\n   - Eve with Patrick\n\n4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Gertrude with Patrick\n   - Eve with Melissa\n\n5. **Fred and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Fred with Jamie\n   - Claire with Rodrigo\n\n6. **Bob and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Bob with Lola\n   - Alice with Helga\n\n7. **Eve and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Eve with Rodrigo\n   - Claire with Melissa\n\nAt the end of these switches, we need to determine who Gertrude is dancing with. According to the last known switch involving Gertrude, she was dancing with Patrick. Since there are no further switches involving Gertrude, she remains with Patrick.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G) Patrick>>>"
