    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the presents as they are swapped among the participants. We will follow the sequence of swaps and determine which present Gertrude ends up with.\n\nInitially, the distribution of presents is as follows:\n- Alice: Red\n- Bob: Purple\n- Claire: White\n- Dave: Brown\n- Eve: Green\n- Fred: Blue\n- Gertrude: Yellow\n\nLet's go through each swap step by step:\n\n1. **Dave and Bob swap their gifts:**\n   - Dave: Purple\n   - Bob: Brown\n\n2. **Alice and Bob swap their gifts:**\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Red\n\n3. **Gertrude and Alice swap their gifts:**\n   - Gertrude: Brown\n   - Alice: Yellow\n\n4. **Claire and Alice swap their gifts:**\n   - Claire: Yellow\n   - Alice: White\n\n5. **Bob and Dave swap their gifts:**\n   - Bob: Purple\n   - Dave: Red\n\n6. **Fred and Alice swap their gifts:**\n   - Fred: White\n   - Alice: Blue\n\n7. **Fred and Eve swap their gifts:**\n   - Fred: Green\n   - Eve: White\n\nAt the end of these swaps, we need to determine which present Gertrude has. After the third swap, Gertrude received the Brown present from Alice, and there are no further swaps involving Gertrude. Therefore, Gertrude ends up with the Brown present.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D) brown present>>>"
