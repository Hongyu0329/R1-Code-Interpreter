    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the balls as the players swap them. We will start by listing the initial distribution of the balls and then apply each swap in sequence to determine the final ball each player holds.\n\nInitial distribution:\n- Alice: green\n- Bob: brown\n- Claire: purple\n- Dave: pink\n- Eve: white\n- Fred: red\n- Gertrude: orange\n\nLet's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. Eve and Dave swap balls:\n   - Eve: pink\n   - Dave: white\n\n2. Claire and Eve swap balls:\n   - Claire: pink\n   - Eve: purple\n\n3. Dave and Claire swap balls:\n   - Dave: pink\n   - Claire: white\n\n4. Bob and Fred swap balls:\n   - Bob: red\n   - Fred: brown\n\n5. Fred and Dave swap balls:\n   - Fred: pink\n   - Dave: brown\n\n6. Eve and Alice swap balls:\n   - Eve: green\n   - Alice: purple\n\n7. Dave and Gertrude swap balls:\n   - Dave: orange\n   - Gertrude: brown\n\nNow, let's determine which ball Alice has at the end of the game. After the swaps, Alice has the purple ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option (C) purple ball.\n\n<<<C>>>"
