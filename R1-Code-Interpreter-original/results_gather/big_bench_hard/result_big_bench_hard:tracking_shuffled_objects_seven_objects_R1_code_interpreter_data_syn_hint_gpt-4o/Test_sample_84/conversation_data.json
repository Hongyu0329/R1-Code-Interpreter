    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Patrick\n- Bob with Lola\n- Claire with Izzi\n- Dave with Rodrigo\n- Eve with Helga\n- Fred with Sam\n- Gertrude with Melissa\n\nNow, let's apply the partner switches:\n\n1. Eve and Bob switch partners:\n   - Eve with Lola\n   - Bob with Helga\n\n2. Eve and Dave switch partners:\n   - Eve with Rodrigo\n   - Dave with Lola\n\n3. Fred and Gertrude switch partners:\n   - Fred with Melissa\n   - Gertrude with Sam\n\n4. Gertrude and Alice switch partners:\n   - Gertrude with Patrick\n   - Alice with Sam\n\n5. Alice and Dave switch partners:\n   - Alice with Lola\n   - Dave with Sam\n\n6. Claire and Alice switch partners:\n   - Claire with Lola\n   - Alice with Izzi\n\n7. Alice and Dave switch partners:\n   - Alice with Sam\n   - Dave with Izzi\n\nAt the end of these switches, we need to determine who Gertrude is dancing with. From the steps above, we see that after step 4, Gertrude is dancing with Patrick, and there are no further changes involving Gertrude. Therefore, Gertrude remains with Patrick.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<A) Patrick>>>"
