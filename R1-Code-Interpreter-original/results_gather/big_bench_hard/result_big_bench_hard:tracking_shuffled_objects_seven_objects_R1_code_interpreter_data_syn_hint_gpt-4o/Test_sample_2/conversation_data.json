    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes throughout the dance. We start with the initial pairings and then apply each switch in sequence.\n\nInitial pairings:\n- Alice with Melissa\n- Bob with Ophelia\n- Claire with Patrick\n- Dave with Jamie\n- Eve with Lola\n- Fred with Helga\n- Gertrude with Izzi\n\nLet's go through each switch step by step:\n\n1. **Alice and Fred switch partners:**\n   - Alice is now with Helga\n   - Fred is now with Melissa\n\n2. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:**\n   - Gertrude is now with Lola\n   - Eve is now with Izzi\n\n3. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Gertrude is now with Helga\n   - Alice is now with Lola\n\n4. **Bob and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Bob is now with Lola\n   - Alice is now with Ophelia\n\n5. **Dave and Fred switch partners:**\n   - Dave is now with Melissa\n   - Fred is now with Jamie\n\n6. **Eve and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Eve is now with Ophelia\n   - Alice is now with Izzi\n\n7. **Eve and Claire switch partners:**\n   - Eve is now with Patrick\n   - Claire is now with Ophelia\n\nAt the end of these switches, we need to determine who Gertrude is dancing with. From step 3, we know Gertrude is with Helga, and there are no further switches involving Gertrude. Therefore, Gertrude remains with Helga.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<F) Helga>>>"
