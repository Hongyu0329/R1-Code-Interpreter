    "To solve this problem, we need to track the position changes of each player as they swap positions according to the given sequence. We will focus on Gertrude's position throughout the swaps.\n\nInitially, the positions are:\n- Alice: left winger\n- Bob: goalkeeper\n- Claire: center midfielder\n- Dave: right midfielder\n- Eve: fullback\n- Fred: left midfielder\n- Gertrude: cheerleader\n\nLet's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Gertrude and Eve trade positions:**\n   - Gertrude: fullback\n   - Eve: cheerleader\n\n2. **Gertrude and Alice trade positions:**\n   - Gertrude: left winger\n   - Alice: fullback\n\n3. **Eve and Claire trade positions:**\n   - Eve: center midfielder\n   - Claire: cheerleader\n\n4. **Fred and Eve trade positions:**\n   - Fred: center midfielder\n   - Eve: left midfielder\n\n5. **Claire and Gertrude trade positions:**\n   - Claire: left winger\n   - Gertrude: cheerleader\n\n6. **Claire and Dave trade positions:**\n   - Claire: right midfielder\n   - Dave: left winger\n\n7. **Fred and Bob trade positions:**\n   - Fred: goalkeeper\n   - Bob: center midfielder\n\nAfter all these swaps, we need to determine Gertrude's final position. From the swaps, we see that after step 5, Gertrude is back to being the cheerleader, and there are no further swaps involving Gertrude. Therefore, Gertrude's final position is cheerleader.\n\nThus, the correct option is (G) cheerleader.\n\n<<<G>>>"
