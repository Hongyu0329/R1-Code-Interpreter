    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are traded among the friends. We will start by assigning each person their initial book and then follow the sequence of trades to determine which book each person has at the end of the semester.\n\n1. Initial assignment:\n   - Alice: Lolita\n   - Bob: Frankenstein\n   - Claire: Moby Dick\n   - Dave: The Pearl\n   - Eve: Hound of the Baskervilles\n   - Fred: The Fellowship of the Ring\n   - Gertrude: The Odyssey\n\n2. Sequence of trades:\n   - Dave and Gertrude swap books:\n     - Dave: The Odyssey\n     - Gertrude: The Pearl\n   - Claire and Bob swap books:\n     - Claire: Frankenstein\n     - Bob: Moby Dick\n   - Alice and Dave swap books:\n     - Alice: The Odyssey\n     - Dave: Lolita\n   - Fred and Claire swap books:\n     - Fred: Frankenstein\n     - Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring\n   - Dave and Fred swap books:\n     - Dave: Frankenstein\n     - Fred: Lolita\n   - Bob and Claire swap books:\n     - Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring\n     - Claire: Moby Dick\n   - Eve and Fred swap books:\n     - Eve: Lolita\n     - Fred: Hound of the Baskervilles\n\nNow, we need to determine which book Eve has at the end of the semester.
