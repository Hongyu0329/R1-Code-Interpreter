    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are traded among the friends. We will start by listing the initial ownership of the books and then apply each swap in sequence to determine the final ownership.\n\nInitial ownership:\n- Alice: Ulysses\n- Bob: Frankenstein\n- Claire: Moby Dick\n- Dave: The Odyssey\n- Eve: The Great Gatsby\n- Fred: Lolita\n- Gertrude: The Pearl\n\nLet's apply the swaps one by one:\n\n1. Bob and Claire swap books:\n   - Bob: Moby Dick\n   - Claire: Frankenstein\n\n2. Eve and Alice swap books:\n   - Eve: Ulysses\n   - Alice: The Great Gatsby\n\n3. Alice and Dave swap books:\n   - Alice: The Odyssey\n   - Dave: The Great Gatsby\n\n4. Gertrude and Dave swap books:\n   - Gertrude: The Great Gatsby\n   - Dave: The Pearl\n\n5. Alice and Bob swap books:\n   - Alice: Moby Dick\n   - Bob: The Odyssey\n\n6. Eve and Claire swap books:\n   - Eve: Frankenstein\n   - Claire: Ulysses\n\n7. Alice and Fred swap books:\n   - Alice: Lolita\n   - Fred: Moby Dick\n\nNow, we need to determine which book Gertrude has at the end of the semester. After the swaps, Gertrude has \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
