    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as they are swapped among the friends. We will start by listing the initial ownership of the books and then apply each swap in sequence to determine the final ownership.\n\nInitial ownership:\n- Alice: The Odyssey\n- Bob: The Great Gatsby\n- Claire: Lolita\n- Dave: The Pearl\n- Eve: The Fellowship of the Ring\n- Fred: Frankenstein\n- Gertrude: Hound of the Baskervilles\n\nLet's apply the swaps step by step:\n\n1. Claire and Bob swap books:\n   - Claire: The Great Gatsby\n   - Bob: Lolita\n\n2. Alice and Dave swap books:\n   - Alice: The Pearl\n   - Dave: The Odyssey\n\n3. Gertrude and Fred swap books:\n   - Gertrude: Frankenstein\n   - Fred: Hound of the Baskervilles\n\n4. Bob and Alice swap books:\n   - Bob: The Pearl\n   - Alice: Lolita\n\n5. Alice and Eve swap books:\n   - Alice: The Fellowship of the Ring\n   - Eve: Lolita\n\n6. Dave and Gertrude swap books:\n   - Dave: Frankenstein\n   - Gertrude: The Odyssey\n\n7. Dave and Eve swap books:\n   - Dave: Lolita\n   - Eve: Frankenstein\n\nNow, we need to determine which book Gertrude has at the end of the semester. After the swaps, Gertrude has The Odyssey.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
