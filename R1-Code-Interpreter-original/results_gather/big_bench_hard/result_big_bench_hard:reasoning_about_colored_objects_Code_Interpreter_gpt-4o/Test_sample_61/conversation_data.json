Magenta sheet of paper\n2. Pink fidget spinner\n3. Turquoise keychain\n4. Green pen\n\nThe magenta sheet of paper is the first item in the row, and the turquoise keychain is the third item. We are asked to find the number of non-turquoise things to the left of the magenta sheet of paper.\n\nSince the magenta sheet of paper is the first item, there are no items to its left. Therefore, the number of non-turquoise things to the left of the magenta sheet of paper is zero.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<zero>>>"
