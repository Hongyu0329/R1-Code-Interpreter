The following argument pertains to this question: Every expert of AS Saint-Étienne is an admirer of FC Krasnodar. Every ex-fan of FC Sion is not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor. Being an admirer of FC Krasnodar is necessary for being an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every expert of AS Saint-Étienne is an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an expert of AS Saint-Étienne, then they are an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ex-fan of FC Sion is not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, then they are either not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Being an admirer of FC Krasnodar is necessary for being an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, then they are an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Being an ex-fan of FC Sion is sufficient for being an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, then they are an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, they are either not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n- If they are not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne, Premise 1 does not apply to them.\n- If they are not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, Premise 3 does not apply to them.\n- However, if they are an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, then by Premise 3, they must be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\nThe conclusion states that being an ex-fan of FC Sion is sufficient for being an admirer of FC Krasnodar. However, the premises do not provide a direct logical path that guarantees this conclusion. The premises allow for the possibility that an ex-fan of FC Sion might not be an admirer of FC Krasnodar if they are neither an expert of AS Saint-Étienne nor an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
