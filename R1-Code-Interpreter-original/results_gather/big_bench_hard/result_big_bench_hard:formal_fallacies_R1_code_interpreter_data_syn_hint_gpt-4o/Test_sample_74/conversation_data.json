  "question": "\"Is Titanium oxide an ingredient of my washing power? Which chemicals does my perfume contain? It is really difficult to keep track of all chemicals one is regularly exposed to. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm. Everything that is an ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, too. In consequence, every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm and an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone?.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, then it is either not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Everything that is an ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, too.\n   - This means: If something is an ingredient of Black Shadow, then it is also an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm and an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone?.\n   - This means: If something is an ingredient of Black Shadow, then it is both an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm and an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone?.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that any ingredient of Black Shadow is also an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch.\n- According to Premise 1, any ingredient of Hawaiian Punch cannot be an ingredient of both Ice Queen Anyone? and Exfoliating Balm simultaneously.\n- The conclusion states that every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of both Exfoliating Balm and Ice Queen Anyone?, which directly contradicts Premise 1.\n\nSince the conclusion contradicts the premises, the argument is deductively invalid. The premises do not logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
