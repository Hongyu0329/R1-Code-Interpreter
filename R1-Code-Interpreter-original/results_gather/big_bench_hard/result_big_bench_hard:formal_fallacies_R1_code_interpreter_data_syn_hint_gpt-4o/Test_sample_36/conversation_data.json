    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Whoever is not a rare consumer of Lever soap is an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n2. There exists an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who is not an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap or not an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Some rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Premise 1**: This can be interpreted as a conditional statement: If a person is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, then they are an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n- **Premise 2**: This states that there is at least one person who is an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo and does not purchase either Paul Mitchell soap or Zest soap occasionally.\n\n### Logical Implication:\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, they must be an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n- Premise 2 provides an example of an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who does not purchase either Paul Mitchell soap or Zest soap occasionally.\n- The conclusion claims that some rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n### Deductive Validity:\n- For the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises.\n- The premises do not provide a direct link between rare consumers of Lever soap and their purchasing habits of Paul Mitchell or Zest soap.\n- The premises only establish a relationship between non-rare consumers of Lever soap and infrequent users of TRESemmé shampoo, and then a separate condition about infrequent users of TRESemmé shampoo.\n- There is no direct logical pathway from the premises to the conclusion that some rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
