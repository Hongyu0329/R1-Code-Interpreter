The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Every supporter of Tottenham Hotspur is not an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and not a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio. Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit. In consequence, everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio is a devotee of FC Zenit.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every supporter of Tottenham Hotspur is not an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and not a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n   - This means if someone supports Tottenham, they cannot be both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n   - This means if someone is both a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio and an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ, they must support Tottenham or be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio is a devotee of FC Zenit.\n   - This means if someone is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they must be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that supporters of Tottenham cannot be both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they must be a supporter of Tottenham or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they must be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio is a devotee of FC Zenit. The premises only provide conditions for those who are both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, not for those who are not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
