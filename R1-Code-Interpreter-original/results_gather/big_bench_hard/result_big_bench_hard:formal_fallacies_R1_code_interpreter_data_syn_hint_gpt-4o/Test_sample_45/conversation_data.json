    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: \"Not being a close friend of Williams is sufficient for not being a nephew of Rolando.\" \n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is not a close friend of Williams, then they are not a nephew of Rolando. In logical terms, this is: \n     \\[\n     \\neg F(x) \\rightarrow \\neg N(x)\n     \\]\n     where \\( F(x) \\) means \"x is a close friend of Williams\" and \\( N(x) \\) means \"x is a nephew of Rolando.\"\n\n2. **Conclusion**: \"Every nephew of Rolando is a close friend of Williams.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a nephew of Rolando, then they are a close friend of Williams. In logical terms, this is:\n     \\[\n     N(x) \\rightarrow F(x)\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship:\n\n- The first premise states that if someone is not a close friend of Williams, then they are not a nephew of Rolando. This is equivalent to saying that if someone is a nephew of Rolando, then they must be a close friend of Williams (contrapositive reasoning).\n\n- The conclusion directly states that every nephew of Rolando is a close friend of Williams, which is exactly what the contrapositive of the first premise implies.\n\nSince the conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the first premise through contrapositive reasoning, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
