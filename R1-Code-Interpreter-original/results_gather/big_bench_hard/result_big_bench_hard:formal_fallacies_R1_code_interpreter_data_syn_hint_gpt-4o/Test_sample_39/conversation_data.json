  "question": "\"Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.\n   - This means that if someone is a brother of Edward, then they must be a nephew of Henry.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is both an ancestor of Carlos and a nephew of Henry, and this person is also a workmate of Efrain.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.\n   - This means that if someone is a brother of Edward, then they are definitely a workmate of Efrain.\n\n**Conclusion**: Somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- From the first premise, we know that to be a brother of Edward, one must be a nephew of Henry.\n- The second premise tells us that there is an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.\n- The third premise states that being a brother of Edward guarantees being a workmate of Efrain.\n\nTo validate the conclusion:\n- We know from the second premise that there is an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry.\n- From the first premise, being a nephew of Henry is necessary to be a brother of Edward.\n- The third premise tells us that if someone is a brother of Edward, they are a workmate of Efrain.\n- Since the ancestor of Carlos is already a workmate of Efrain (from the second premise), and being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain, it is possible that this ancestor is also a brother of Edward.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
