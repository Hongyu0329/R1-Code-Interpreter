    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being an expert of Aberdeen FC is sufficient for not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Every expert of Aberdeen FC is not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are either not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid (or both).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is an expert of Aberdeen FC is not a fan of AZ Alkmaar.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are not a fan of AZ Alkmaar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that being an expert of Aberdeen FC implies not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n- The second premise states that being an expert of Aberdeen FC implies either not being a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n- The conclusion claims that being an expert of Aberdeen FC implies not being a fan of AZ Alkmaar.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises:\n\n- The first premise ensures that an expert of Aberdeen FC is not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n- The second premise gives two possibilities: not being a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid. Since the first premise already ensures the latter (not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid), the only remaining possibility is that they are not a fan of AZ Alkmaar.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
