    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Peach Paint is sufficient for being an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n   - This means if something is an ingredient of Peach Paint, it must also be an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or an ingredient of Calming Shampoo.\n   - This means if something is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, it must be an ingredient of either Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every ingredient of Peach Paint is an ingredient of Calming Shampoo or an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde.\n   - This is what we need to determine as valid or invalid based on the premises.\n\n**Logical Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, if X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, then X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n- From Premise 2, if X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, then X is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo.\n- Therefore, if X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, then X is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The structure of the argument is such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is a classic example of a deductively valid argument where the conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
