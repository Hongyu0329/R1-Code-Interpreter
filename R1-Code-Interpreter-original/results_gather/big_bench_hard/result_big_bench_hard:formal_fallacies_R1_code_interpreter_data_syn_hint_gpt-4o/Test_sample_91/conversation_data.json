    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n2. **Second Premise**: Oliver is not a supporter of FC Viitorul.\n3. **Third Premise**: Every supporter of SK Rapid Wien is neither a supporter of FC Viitorul nor an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n\n**Conclusion**: It is false that Oliver is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nLet's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion:\n\n- From the third premise, we know that if someone is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien, they cannot be a supporter of FC Viitorul and cannot be an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n- Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz (First Premise), which is consistent with being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n- Oliver is not a supporter of FC Viitorul (Second Premise), which is also consistent with being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nThe premises do not provide any information that directly contradicts Oliver being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien. In fact, the premises are consistent with Oliver being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien. Therefore, the conclusion that \"it is false that Oliver is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien\" does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
