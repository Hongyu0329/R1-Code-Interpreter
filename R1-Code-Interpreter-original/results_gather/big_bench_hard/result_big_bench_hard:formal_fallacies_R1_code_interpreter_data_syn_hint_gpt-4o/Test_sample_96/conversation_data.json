    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Gorgeous is necessary for not being an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is not an ingredient of Gorgeous, then it is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Something is not an ingredient of Gorgeous and, in addition, not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n   - This can be interpreted as: There exists something (let's call it X) such that X is not an ingredient of Gorgeous and (X is not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or X is not an ingredient of Deternined).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: There is something that is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow and not both an ingredient of Coverage Duo and an ingredient of Deternined.\n   - This can be interpreted as: There exists something (let's call it Y) such that Y is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow and (Y is not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or Y is not an ingredient of Deternined).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if something is not an ingredient of Gorgeous, it must be an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\n- From Premise 2, we know there exists something that is not an ingredient of Gorgeous. Therefore, by Premise 1, this something must be an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\n- Premise 2 also states that this something is not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: there exists something that is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow and not both an ingredient of Coverage Duo and an ingredient of Deternined.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
