    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a niece of Shona is sufficient for not being a daughter of Hattie.\n3. **Conclusion**: Carmen is not a niece of Shona.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is a niece of Shona, then they cannot be a daughter of Hattie. This implies a mutually exclusive relationship between being a niece of Shona and being a daughter of Hattie.\n- Given that Carmen is a daughter of Hattie (Premise 1), she cannot be a niece of Shona according to Premise 2.\n\nThe conclusion that \"Carmen is not a niece of Shona\" logically follows from the premises. The premises provide a sufficient condition that excludes the possibility of Carmen being a niece of Shona if she is a daughter of Hattie.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
