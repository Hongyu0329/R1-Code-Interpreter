The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, not being an ingredient of Pink Smoothie is sufficient for not being an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC. Now, everything that is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, too. All this entails that every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: Not being an ingredient of Pink Smoothie is sufficient for not being an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is not an ingredient of Pink Smoothie, then it is not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\n2. Premise 2: Everything that is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This means: If something is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER, then it is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\n3. Conclusion: Every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER, then it is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that all ingredients of ILLUMINIZING POWDER are also ingredients of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- Premise 1 states that if something is not an ingredient of Pink Smoothie, it cannot be an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- For the conclusion to be true, every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER must also be an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n\nHowever, the premises do not provide a direct link between ILLUMINIZING POWDER and Pink Smoothie. The premises only establish a relationship between ILLUMINIZING POWDER and A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, and between Pink Smoothie and A.D LIPSTICK CHIC. There is no premise that directly connects ILLUMINIZING POWDER to Pink Smoothie.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
