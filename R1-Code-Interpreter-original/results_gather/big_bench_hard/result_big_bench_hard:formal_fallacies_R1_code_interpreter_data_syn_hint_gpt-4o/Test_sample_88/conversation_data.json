    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some classmate of Sherry is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is a classmate of Sherry and does not satisfy both conditions of being a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie simultaneously.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a schoolmate of Leonor is sufficient for being a half-sister of Peggy.\n   - This implies that if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, then they are automatically a half-sister of Peggy.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Leonor is a great-grandmother of Sophie, too.\n   - This means that if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, they are also a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n\n**Conclusion**: There is somebody who is a classmate of Sherry and not a schoolmate of Leonor.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2 and Premise 3, we can deduce that if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, they must be both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n- Premise 1 states that there is a classmate of Sherry who is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie. This implies that this classmate of Sherry cannot be a schoolmate of Leonor, because if they were, they would have to be both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie, contradicting Premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
