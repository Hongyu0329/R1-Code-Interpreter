    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo is necessary for being a regular consumer of Yardley London soap.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, then they must be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is a regular user of Joico shampoo is not a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a regular user of Joico shampoo, then they are not a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: No regular consumer of Yardley London soap is a regular user of Joico shampoo.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, then they are not a regular user of Joico shampoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, they must be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a regular user of Joico shampoo, they cannot be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n- Therefore, if someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, they cannot be a regular user of Joico shampoo, because being a regular user of Joico shampoo would contradict the requirement of being a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo (as per Premise 2).\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
