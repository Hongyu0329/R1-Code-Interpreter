    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premises:**\n   - Nobody is neither an ancestor of Alvin nor a workmate of Tony.\n   - Whoever is a schoolmate of Keith is not an ancestor of Alvin.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - Everyone who is a schoolmate of Keith is a workmate of Tony.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The first premise states that nobody is neither an ancestor of Alvin nor a workmate of Tony. This can be interpreted as: if someone is not an ancestor of Alvin, then they must be a workmate of Tony.\n\n- The second premise states that whoever is a schoolmate of Keith is not an ancestor of Alvin.\n\n- From the second premise, we can infer that if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they are not an ancestor of Alvin. According to the first premise, if someone is not an ancestor of Alvin, they must be a workmate of Tony.\n\n- Therefore, if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they are not an ancestor of Alvin, and thus, by the first premise, they must be a workmate of Tony.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
