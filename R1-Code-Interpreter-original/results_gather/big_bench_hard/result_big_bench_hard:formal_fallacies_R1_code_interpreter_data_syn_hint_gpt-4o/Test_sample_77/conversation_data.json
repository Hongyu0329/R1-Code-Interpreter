    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne is an ancestor of Leslie.\n3. **Conclusion**: It is false that Darwin is an ancestor of Leslie.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne, then they are an ancestor of Leslie. This is a conditional statement.\n- The conclusion states that Darwin is not an ancestor of Leslie.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- According to Premise 2, for someone to not be an ancestor of Leslie, they must be both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne.\n- Since Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne (Premise 1), for him to not be an ancestor of Leslie, he must also be a half-brother of Alvin.\n- The conclusion states that Darwin is not an ancestor of Leslie, which implies that Darwin must be both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne.\n\nThe argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
