  "question": "\"Is Siri a stepsister of Mary? Is Susan related to Kate? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Whoever is not a workmate of Hilda is a stepsister of Heather. Every workmate of Hilda is either a stepsister of Heather or an aunt of Clara, or both. We may conclude: Being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premises:**\n   - Whoever is not a workmate of Hilda is a stepsister of Heather.\n   - Every workmate of Hilda is either a stepsister of Heather or an aunt of Clara, or both.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - Being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From the first premise, we know that if someone is not a workmate of Hilda, they must be a stepsister of Heather. This implies that all non-workmates of Hilda are stepsisters of Heather.\n\n- The second premise states that every workmate of Hilda is either a stepsister of Heather, an aunt of Clara, or both. This means that being a workmate of Hilda does not necessarily require being an aunt of Clara, as one could be a stepsister of Heather instead.\n\n- The conclusion claims that being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda. However, the second premise allows for the possibility that a workmate of Hilda could be a stepsister of Heather without being an aunt of Clara.\n\nSince the premises allow for workmates of Hilda to be stepsisters of Heather without being aunts of Clara, the conclusion that being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
