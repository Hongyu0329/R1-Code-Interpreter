    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Whoever is not a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo is not a rare consumer of South of France soap or not a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: \n     - If not Regular(Pantene), then not Rare(South of France) or not Rare(Kiss My Face).\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Being a rare consumer of South of France soap is necessary for not being a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     - If not Rare(South of France), then Frequent(Proactiv).\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap nor a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     - If not Frequent(Proactiv), then Rare(Kiss My Face).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap is a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     - If not Frequent(Proactiv), then Regular(Pantene).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the third premise, if someone is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv, they must be a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- From the first premise, if someone is not a regular consumer of Pantene, they must either not be a rare consumer of South of France or not be a rare consumer of Kiss My Face.\n- If they are a rare consumer of Kiss My Face (from the third premise), then the first premise implies they must be a rare consumer of South of France to avoid contradicting the first premise.\n- However, if they are a rare consumer of South of France, the second premise implies they cannot be a frequent consumer of Proactiv, which is consistent with the third premise.\n- Therefore, if they are not a frequent consumer of Proactiv, they must be a regular consumer of Pantene to satisfy all premises without contradiction.\n\nThe logical structure holds, and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
