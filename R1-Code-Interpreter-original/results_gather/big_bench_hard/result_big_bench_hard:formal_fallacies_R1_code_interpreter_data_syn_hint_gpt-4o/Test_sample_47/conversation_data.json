    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: Every close friend of Myra is neither a cousin of Sue nor a daughter of Tommy.\n   - This means that if someone is a close friend of Myra, then they cannot be a cousin of Sue and they cannot be a daughter of Tommy.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: No cousin of Sue and no daughter of Tommy is a close friend of Myra.\n   - This means that if someone is a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy, then they cannot be a close friend of Myra.\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise states a condition for being a close friend of Myra: they cannot be a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy.\n- The conclusion states that being a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy excludes the possibility of being a close friend of Myra.\n\nThe conclusion is essentially a restatement of the premise in a different form. The premise states a condition for being a close friend, and the conclusion states the same condition in terms of exclusion from being a close friend.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
