  "question": "\"Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: First of all, some backer of BSC Young Boys is a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Next, being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ. Plus,being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor. So, necessarily, there is somebody who is a backer of BSC Young Boys and an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some backer of BSC Young Boys is a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is both a backer of BSC Young Boys and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n   - This implies that if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, then they are necessarily a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n   - This means that if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, they must be an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n**Conclusion**: There is somebody who is a backer of BSC Young Boys and an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\n**Logical Analysis**:\n- From Premise 3, we know that being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is a requirement for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n- From Premise 1, we know there is a backer of BSC Young Boys who is also an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- However, Premise 1 does not state that this person is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, only that they are an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- Premise 2 states that being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ, but it does not provide a direct link to being a backer of BSC Young Boys.\n\nThe conclusion requires that there is a person who is both a backer of BSC Young Boys and an ex-fan of NK Maribor. However, the premises do not provide a direct logical connection that guarantees the existence of such a person. The premises only establish that there is a backer of BSC Young Boys who is an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen, and that being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor. There is no premise that directly links being a backer of BSC Young Boys to being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
