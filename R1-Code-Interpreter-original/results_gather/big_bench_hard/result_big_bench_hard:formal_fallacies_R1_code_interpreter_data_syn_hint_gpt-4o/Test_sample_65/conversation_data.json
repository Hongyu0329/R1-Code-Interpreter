    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion logically.\n\n1. **First Premise**: It is not the case that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Nobility.\n   - This means Propylene oxide is not in Nobility.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: It is false that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core.\n   - This means Propylene oxide is not in Cover Pink, Core.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is neither an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core nor an ingredient of Nobility.\n   - This means that if something is an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry, it cannot be an ingredient of either Cover Pink, Core or Nobility.\n\n**Conclusion**: Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- From the first and second premises, we know that Propylene oxide is not in either Nobility or Cover Pink, Core.\n- The third premise states that any ingredient of Charged Up Cherry cannot be in either Nobility or Cover Pink, Core.\n- Since Propylene oxide is not in Nobility or Cover Pink, Core, it does not violate the condition set by the third premise.\n- However, the third premise does not provide any information about what is actually in Charged Up Cherry, only what cannot be in it if it is in the other two products.\n- Therefore, the premises do not logically lead to the conclusion that Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry. The premises do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that Propylene oxide is not in Charged Up Cherry.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
