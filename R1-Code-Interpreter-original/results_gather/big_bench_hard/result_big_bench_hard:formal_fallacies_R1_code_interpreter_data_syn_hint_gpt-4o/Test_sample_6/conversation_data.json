    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ingredient of Sahara Saphire is both an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and an ingredient of Brushless Mascara.\n2. **Premise 2**: Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap.\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- Premise 1 states a condition about the ingredients of Sahara Saphire: if something is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire, then it must also be an ingredient of both Pink Lotion Soap and Brushless Mascara.\n- Premise 2 states that Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap.\n\nThe conclusion claims that Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire. However, the premises do not provide any information that directly links Cocamide to Sahara Saphire. Premise 1 only states a condition about the ingredients of Sahara Saphire, but it does not state that all ingredients of Pink Lotion Soap are ingredients of Sahara Saphire. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
