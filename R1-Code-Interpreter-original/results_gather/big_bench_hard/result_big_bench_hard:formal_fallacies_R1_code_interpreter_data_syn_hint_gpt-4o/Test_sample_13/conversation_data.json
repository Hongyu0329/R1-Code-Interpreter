    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ancestor of Jonathan is sufficient for not being a grandson of Carmelo.\n   - This means if someone is an ancestor of Jonathan, they cannot be a grandson of Carmelo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is an ancestor of Jonathan is not a schoolmate of Reyes.\n   - This means if someone is an ancestor of Jonathan, they cannot be a schoolmate of Reyes.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Every grandson of Carmelo who is a schoolmate of Reyes is also a close friend of Clifford.\n   - This means if someone is both a grandson of Carmelo and a schoolmate of Reyes, then they are a close friend of Clifford.\n\n**Conclusion**: Being an ancestor of Jonathan is sufficient for being a close friend of Clifford.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is an ancestor of Jonathan, they are not a grandson of Carmelo.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is an ancestor of Jonathan, they are not a schoolmate of Reyes.\n- Premise 3 states that only those who are both grandsons of Carmelo and schoolmates of Reyes are close friends of Clifford.\n\nThe conclusion claims that being an ancestor of Jonathan is sufficient for being a close friend of Clifford. However, the premises do not provide any direct link between being an ancestor of Jonathan and being a close friend of Clifford. The premises only establish conditions under which someone is not a close friend of Clifford (i.e., not being both a grandson of Carmelo and a schoolmate of Reyes).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
