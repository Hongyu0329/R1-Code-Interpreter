    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a close friend of Glenna is a close friend of Tamara.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Glenna.\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a half-sister of Deborah or workmate of Nila, is a close friend of Tamara.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Glenna.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a close friend of Glenna, then they are also a close friend of Tamara.\n\nThe conclusion states that if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Tamara. This follows directly from the combination of Premise 1 and Premise 2:\n\n- If someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, they are a close friend of Glenna (Premise 2).\n- If they are a close friend of Glenna, they are a close friend of Tamara (Premise 1).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
