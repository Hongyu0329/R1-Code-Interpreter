    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No ex-supporter of Getafe CF is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n2. **Premise 2**: Everyone who is a friend of R. Charleroi SC is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF, they cannot be a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they must be a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC, then they are an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nTo check the validity, let's consider the contrapositive of Premise 2:\n\n- If someone is not a critic of Kilmarnock FC, then they are not a friend of R. Charleroi SC.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n\n- If someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC, according to the contrapositive of Premise 2, they are not a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- According to Premise 1, if someone is not a critic of Kilmarnock FC, they could be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF, but it doesn't necessarily mean they must be.\n\nThe conclusion that \"whoever is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF\" does not logically follow from the premises because there could be individuals who are neither friends of R. Charleroi SC nor ex-supporters of Getafe CF. The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that all non-friends of R. Charleroi SC must be ex-supporters of Getafe CF.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
