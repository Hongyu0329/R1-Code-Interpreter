    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every schoolmate of Jeffery is a grandson of Todd.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is a schoolmate of Jeffery is at least one of these: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern.\n3. **Premise 3**: Every schoolmate of Jeffery is an uncle of Lavern.\n\n**Conclusion**: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Jeffery is a brother of Kenneth, too.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that all schoolmates of Jeffery are grandsons of Todd.\n- Premise 2 states that schoolmates of Jeffery must be at least one of the following: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern. Since Premise 1 already establishes that they are grandsons of Todd, this condition is satisfied.\n- Premise 3 states that every schoolmate of Jeffery is an uncle of Lavern.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\n- The conclusion claims that every schoolmate of Jeffery is also a brother of Kenneth. However, none of the premises directly or indirectly establish that being a grandson of Todd or an uncle of Lavern implies being a brother of Kenneth. \n\nThe premises do not provide any information that would lead to the conclusion that schoolmates of Jeffery are brothers of Kenneth. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
