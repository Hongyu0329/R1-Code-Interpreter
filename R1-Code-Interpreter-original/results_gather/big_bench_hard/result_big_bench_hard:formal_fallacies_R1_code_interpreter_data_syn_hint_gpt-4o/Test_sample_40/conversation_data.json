The following argument pertains to this question: To start with, every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir. Now, every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir or a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC. Therefore, every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir or a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n\n**Conclusion**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a critic of FC Ufa, they must be a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n- Premise 2 states that every critic of FC Ufa is either a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir, a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva, or an expert of Randers FC.\n\nThe conclusion claims that every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 already states that every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir. \n- Premise 2 adds that they could also be a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC, but it doesn't negate the possibility of them being just a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n\nThe conclusion, however, excludes the possibility of being just a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir, which is allowed by Premise 1. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises because it excludes a possibility that the premises allow.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
