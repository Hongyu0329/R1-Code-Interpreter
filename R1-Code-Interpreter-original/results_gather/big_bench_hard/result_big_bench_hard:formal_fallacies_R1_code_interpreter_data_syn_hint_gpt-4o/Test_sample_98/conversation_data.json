    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Andres is a member of Paris Saint-Germain.\n2. **Premise 2**: It is false that Andres is a follower of FC Mariupol.\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is a follower of FC Mariupol and a member of Paris Saint-Germain is also a devotee of FC Arouca.\n4. **Conclusion**: Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- From Premise 3, we know that being both a follower of FC Mariupol and a member of Paris Saint-Germain leads to being a devotee of FC Arouca.\n- Premise 2 states that Andres is not a follower of FC Mariupol. Therefore, the condition in Premise 3 is not satisfied for Andres.\n- Since the condition in Premise 3 is not satisfied, Premise 3 does not apply to Andres, and we cannot conclude anything about Andres being a devotee of FC Arouca based solely on Premise 3.\n\nThe conclusion that Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca does not necessarily follow from the premises. The premises do not provide sufficient information to deduce the conclusion with certainty. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
