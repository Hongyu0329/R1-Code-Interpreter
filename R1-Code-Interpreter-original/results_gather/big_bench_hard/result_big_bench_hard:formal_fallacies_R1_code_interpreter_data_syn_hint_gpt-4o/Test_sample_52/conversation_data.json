    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: Whoever is an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo is not a regular user of Ivory soap.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo, then they are not a regular user of Ivory soap.\n   - In logical terms: If P (occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo), then not Q (not a regular user of Ivory soap).\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Being a regular user of Ivory soap is sufficient for not being an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a regular user of Ivory soap, then they are not an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo.\n   - In logical terms: If Q (regular user of Ivory soap), then not P (not an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The premise states: If P, then not Q.\n- The conclusion states: If Q, then not P.\n\nThis is a classic example of a contrapositive relationship in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P,\" and they are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
