  "question": "\"Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, some uncle of Dominic is a schoolmate of Earl. Next, everyone who is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey is not a schoolmate of Earl. All this entails that some uncle of Dominic is not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some uncle of Dominic is a schoolmate of Earl.\n2. **Premise 2**: Everyone who is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey is not a schoolmate of Earl.\n\n**Conclusion**: Some uncle of Dominic is not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n- **Premise 1** states that there exists at least one person who is both an uncle of Dominic and a schoolmate of Earl.\n- **Premise 2** states that if someone is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey, then that person cannot be a schoolmate of Earl.\n\nThe conclusion claims that there exists at least one person who is an uncle of Dominic and is either not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey.\n\n**Logical Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know there is at least one uncle of Dominic who is a schoolmate of Earl.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is both an uncle of Reyes and Corey, they cannot be a schoolmate of Earl.\n- Therefore, the uncle of Dominic who is a schoolmate of Earl cannot be both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey, because that would contradict Premise 2.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: there must be an uncle of Dominic who is not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey, to satisfy both premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
