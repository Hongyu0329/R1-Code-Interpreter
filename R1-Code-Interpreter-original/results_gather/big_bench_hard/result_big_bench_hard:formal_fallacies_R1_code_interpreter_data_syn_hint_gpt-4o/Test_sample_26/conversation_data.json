    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every admirer of AEK Athens FC is an expert of Feyenoord.\n3. **Conclusion**: Jose is an expert of Feyenoord.\n\nA deductively valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premises provide a clear logical path to the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC.\n- Premise 2 states that every admirer of AEK Athens FC is an expert of Feyenoord.\n- Therefore, it logically follows that Jose, being an admirer of AEK Athens FC, must be an expert of Feyenoord.\n\nThe conclusion is directly supported by the premises, and there is no logical gap between them. Thus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
