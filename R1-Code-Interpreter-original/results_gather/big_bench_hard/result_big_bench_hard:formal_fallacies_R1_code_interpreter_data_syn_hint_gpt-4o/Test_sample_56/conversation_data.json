So, necessarily, Santo is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal is not a son of Ronald.\n2. **Premise 2**: It is false that Santo is a son of Ronald.\n\n**Conclusion**: Santo is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal, then they cannot be a son of Ronald.\n- Premise 2 states that Santo is not a son of Ronald.\n\nGiven these premises, we need to determine if the conclusion that Santo is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal necessarily follows.\n\n- If Santo is not a son of Ronald (Premise 2), it does not necessarily mean he must be a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal. There could be other reasons why Santo is not a son of Ronald that are not covered by Premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
