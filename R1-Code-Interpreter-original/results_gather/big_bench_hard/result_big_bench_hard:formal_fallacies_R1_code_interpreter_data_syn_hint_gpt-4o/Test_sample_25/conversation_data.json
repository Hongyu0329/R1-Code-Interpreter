    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: Nobody is neither a workmate of Calvin nor a schoolmate of Barton.\n   - This means that everyone is either a workmate of Calvin or a schoolmate of Barton (or both).\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Being a workmate of Calvin is necessary for not being a schoolmate of Barton.\n   - This implies that if someone is not a schoolmate of Barton, then they must be a workmate of Calvin.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- The premise states that everyone falls into at least one of the two categories: workmate of Calvin or schoolmate of Barton.\n- The conclusion claims that to not be a schoolmate of Barton, one must be a workmate of Calvin.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because if someone is not a schoolmate of Barton, the only other option (given the premise) is that they must be a workmate of Calvin. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
