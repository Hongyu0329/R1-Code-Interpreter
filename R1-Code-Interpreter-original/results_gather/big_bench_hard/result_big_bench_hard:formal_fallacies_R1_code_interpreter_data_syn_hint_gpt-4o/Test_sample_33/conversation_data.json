    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Whatever is an ingredient of Vertica Rush and an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n\n   This can be represented as:\n   - If X is an ingredient of both Vertica Rush and Liqua Versa Gel, then X is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Every ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.\n\n   This can be represented as:\n   - If X is an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad, then X is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or X is not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise states that if something is an ingredient of both Vertica Rush and Liqua Versa Gel, it cannot be an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n- The conclusion states that if something is an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad, it cannot be an ingredient of both Vertica Rush and Liqua Versa Gel simultaneously (i.e., it must be missing from at least one of them).\n\nThe conclusion is essentially a contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, making the argument deductively valid.\n\nThus, the argument is valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
