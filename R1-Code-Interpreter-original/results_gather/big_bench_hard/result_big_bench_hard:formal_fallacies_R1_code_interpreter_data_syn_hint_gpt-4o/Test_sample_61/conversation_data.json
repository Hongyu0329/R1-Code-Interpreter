    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Every uncle of Harvey is not an ancestor of Adrian.\n2. Every uncle of Harvey is not a nephew of Ward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No nephew of Ward and no ancestor of Adrian is an uncle of Harvey.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From premise 1, we know that if someone is an uncle of Harvey, they cannot be an ancestor of Adrian. This means that the set of uncles of Harvey and the set of ancestors of Adrian are disjoint.\n\n- From premise 2, we know that if someone is an uncle of Harvey, they cannot be a nephew of Ward. This means that the set of uncles of Harvey and the set of nephews of Ward are disjoint.\n\n**Conclusion Analysis:**\n\n- The conclusion states that no nephew of Ward and no ancestor of Adrian is an uncle of Harvey. \n\n- This conclusion is directly supported by the premises. Since the sets are disjoint as per the premises, it logically follows that no member of the set of nephews of Ward or the set of ancestors of Adrian can be an uncle of Harvey.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
