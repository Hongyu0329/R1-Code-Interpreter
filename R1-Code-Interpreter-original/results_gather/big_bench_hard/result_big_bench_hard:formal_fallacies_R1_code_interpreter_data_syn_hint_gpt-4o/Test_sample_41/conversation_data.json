The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, everyone who is a schoolmate of Mildred is a daughter of Jeanette, too. Now, being a daughter of Jeanette is sufficient for not being a cousin of Cristi.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Mildred is a daughter of Jeanette.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a daughter of Jeanette is sufficient for not being a cousin of Cristi.\n\n**Conclusion**: No schoolmate of Mildred is a cousin of Cristi.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, then they are a daughter of Jeanette.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a daughter of Jeanette, then they cannot be a cousin of Cristi.\n\nThe conclusion states that no schoolmate of Mildred is a cousin of Cristi. \n\nTo check for deductive validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- If someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, by Premise 1, they must be a daughter of Jeanette.\n- If they are a daughter of Jeanette, by Premise 2, they cannot be a cousin of Cristi.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that no schoolmate of Mildred is a cousin of Cristi logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is the definition of a deductively valid argument.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
