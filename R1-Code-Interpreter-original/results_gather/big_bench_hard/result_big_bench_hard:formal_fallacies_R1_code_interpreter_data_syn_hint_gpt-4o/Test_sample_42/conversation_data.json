    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise: Every ingredient of the Moisturizing Bar is neither an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR nor an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM.\n2. Conclusion: Therefore, necessarily, whatever is none of this: an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM or an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR, is an ingredient of Moisturizing Bar.\n\nLet's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise states that the set of ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar is disjoint from the sets of ingredients of 31 EYE COLOUR and VITAMIN E BB CREAM. This means there is no overlap between the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar and the ingredients of the other two products.\n\n- The conclusion claims that if something is not an ingredient of either 31 EYE COLOUR or VITAMIN E BB CREAM, then it must be an ingredient of the Moisturizing Bar.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premise. However, the premise only tells us about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar, not about all possible ingredients in the world. The conclusion makes a universal claim about all ingredients that are not part of 31 EYE COLOUR or VITAMIN E BB CREAM, which is not supported by the premise. The premise does not provide information about ingredients that are not part of any of the three products.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
