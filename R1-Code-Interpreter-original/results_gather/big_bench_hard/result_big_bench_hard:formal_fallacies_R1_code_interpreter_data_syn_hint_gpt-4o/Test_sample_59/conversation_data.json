  "question": "\"Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First of all, every loyal buyer of Tocca soap is an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap. Next, being a loyal buyer of Tocca soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo. Plus,some regular user of Lever soap is not an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap or not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo. We may conclude that not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every loyal buyer of Tocca soap is an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a loyal buyer of Tocca soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n3. **Premise 3**: Some regular user of Lever soap is not an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap or not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n4. **Conclusion**: Not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical connections:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, they must be a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n- Premise 3 states that there exists at least one regular user of Lever soap who is either not an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap or not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n\nThe conclusion claims that not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap. \n\nTo determine the validity, we need to see if the premises logically lead to the conclusion:\n\n- If a regular user of Lever soap were a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, according to Premises 1 and 2, they would have to be both an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap and a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n- However, Premise 3 provides a counterexample: there is at least one regular user of Lever soap who does not meet one or both of these conditions.\n- Therefore, this counterexample supports the conclusion that not every regular user of Lever soap can be a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\n\nThe argument is structured such that the premises logically lead to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
