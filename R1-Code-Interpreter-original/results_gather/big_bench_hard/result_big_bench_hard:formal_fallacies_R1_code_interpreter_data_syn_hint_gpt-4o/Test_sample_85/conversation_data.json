    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi is a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If a person is not a cousin of Valerie and not a classmate of Mitzi, then they are a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every close friend of Kathryn is a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If a person is a close friend of Kathryn, then they are a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a cousin of Valerie or classmate of Mitzi, is a workmate of Anita.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If a person is not a cousin of Valerie and not a classmate of Mitzi, then they are a workmate of Anita.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if a person is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, they must be either a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n- From Premise 2, if a person is a close friend of Kathryn, they must be either a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n\nCombining these two premises, if a person is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, they cannot be a close friend of Kathryn (because that would make them a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie, contradicting the initial condition). Therefore, they must be a workmate of Anita.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premises, as the only remaining option for someone who is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi is to be a workmate of Anita.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
