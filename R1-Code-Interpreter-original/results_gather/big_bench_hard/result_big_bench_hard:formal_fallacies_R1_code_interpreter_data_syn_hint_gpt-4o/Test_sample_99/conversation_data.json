Now, every frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is neither a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: Everyone who is both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap or a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n2. Premise 2: Every frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is neither a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\n3. Conclusion: Everyone who is not both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences, they must be either a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine or a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine, they cannot be both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences.\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences, they must be a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\nTo check the validity, let's consider the contrapositive of Premise 1: If someone is not a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine and not a regular user of Mysore soap, then they are not both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences.\n\nThis contrapositive aligns with the conclusion, which states that if someone is not both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences, they must be a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
