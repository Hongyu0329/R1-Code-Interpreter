    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every aunt of Rosa who is a sister of Amanda is also a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda, then they are a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: It is not the case that Amy is an aunt of Rosa.\n   - This means Amy is not an aunt of Rosa.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Amy is a sister of Amanda.\n   - This means Amy satisfies the condition of being a sister of Amanda.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n\nTo check for deductive validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 1, we know that to be a great-grandmother of Hellen, one must be both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda.\n- Premise 2 tells us that Amy is not an aunt of Rosa, which means she does not satisfy the first condition of Premise 1.\n- Therefore, Amy cannot be a great-grandmother of Hellen based on Premise 1, because she does not meet all the necessary conditions.\n\nThe conclusion that Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen logically follows from the premises provided. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
