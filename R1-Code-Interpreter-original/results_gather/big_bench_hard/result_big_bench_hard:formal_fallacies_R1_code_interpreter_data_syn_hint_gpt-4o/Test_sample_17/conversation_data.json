Second premise: No follower of FK Kukësi is a friend of Olympique de Marseille. Therefore, whoever is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Everyone who is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is a follower of FK Kukësi.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they are a follower of FK Kukësi.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: No follower of FK Kukësi is a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a follower of FK Kukësi, then they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, if someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, they must be a follower of FK Kukësi.\n- From the second premise, if someone is a follower of FK Kukësi, they cannot be a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n- Therefore, if someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, they cannot be a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is the definition of a deductively valid argument.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
