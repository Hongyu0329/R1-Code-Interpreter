    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, then it is not an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies or not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: \n     \\[\n     \\neg S \\rightarrow (\\neg N \\lor \\neg E)\n     \\]\n     where \\( S \\) is \"ingredient of Skin Tint FX\", \\( N \\) is \"ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies\", and \\( E \\) is \"ingredient of Eyebrow Kit\".\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit is necessary for not being an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\neg I \\rightarrow E\n     \\]\n     where \\( I \\) is \"ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101\".\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whatever is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 is an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\neg I \\rightarrow N\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Nothing is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\neg (\\neg I \\land \\neg S)\n     \\]\n     which is equivalent to:\n     \\[\n     I \\lor S\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2 (\\(\\neg I \\rightarrow E\\)) and Premise 3 (\\(\\neg I \\rightarrow N\\)), we can deduce that if something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\(\\neg I\\)), it must be an ingredient of both NYC Nail Glossies (\\(N\\)) and Eyebrow Kit (\\(E\\)).\n\n- From Premise 1 (\\(\\neg S \\rightarrow (\\neg N \\lor \\neg E)\\)), if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\(\\neg S\\)), it cannot be both an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies and Eyebrow Kit simultaneously.\n\n- Therefore, if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\(\\neg S\\)), it cannot be not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\(\\neg I\\)), because \\(\\neg I\\) implies both \\(N\\) and \\(E\\), which contradicts \\(\\neg S \\rightarrow (\\neg N \\lor \\neg E)\\).\n\n- Thus, if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\(\\neg S\\)), it must be an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\(I\\)).\n\n- This means that for any item, either it is an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\(I\\)) or an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\(S\\)), which matches the conclusion (\\(I \\lor S\\)).\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
