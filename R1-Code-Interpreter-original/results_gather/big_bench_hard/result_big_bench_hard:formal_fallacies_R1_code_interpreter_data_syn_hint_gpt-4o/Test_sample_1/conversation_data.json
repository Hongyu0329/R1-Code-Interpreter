    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument.\n\nThe argument states:\n1. Being a cousin of Chris is sufficient for not being a son of Kermit.\n2. We may conclude that whoever is not a son of Kermit is a cousin of Chris.\n\nLet's break down the premises and conclusion:\n\n- Premise 1: If someone is a cousin of Chris, then they are not a son of Kermit. (Cousin of Chris → Not a son of Kermit)\n- Conclusion: If someone is not a son of Kermit, then they are a cousin of Chris. (Not a son of Kermit → Cousin of Chris)\n\nThe argument is attempting to conclude the inverse of the given premise. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true. The original statement (Cousin of Chris → Not a son of Kermit) does not logically imply its inverse (Not a son of Kermit → Cousin of Chris).\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
