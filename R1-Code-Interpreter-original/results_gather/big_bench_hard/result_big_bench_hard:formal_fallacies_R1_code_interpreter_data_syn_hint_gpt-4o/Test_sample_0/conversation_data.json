    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise: Whoever is a schoolmate of Sondra is not a stepsister of Pricilla.\n2. Conclusion: Whoever is not a stepsister of Pricilla is a schoolmate of Sondra.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- The first premise states a condition: If someone is a schoolmate of Sondra, then they are not a stepsister of Pricilla. This can be represented as:\n  - If A (schoolmate of Sondra), then not B (not a stepsister of Pricilla).\n\n- The conclusion attempts to reverse this condition: If someone is not a stepsister of Pricilla, then they are a schoolmate of Sondra. This can be represented as:\n  - If not B (not a stepsister of Pricilla), then A (schoolmate of Sondra).\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The original premise does not logically support the conclusion because the conclusion attempts to reverse the implication without justification. Just because being a schoolmate of Sondra implies not being a stepsister of Pricilla, it does not mean that not being a stepsister of Pricilla implies being a schoolmate of Sondra.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<'invalid'>>>"
