    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: William is a devotee of AC Milan.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every devotee of AC Milan and every expert of Yeni Malatyaspor is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n3. **Conclusion**: William is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n\nA deductively valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, we need to check if the premises logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that William is a devotee of AC Milan.\n- Premise 2 states that every devotee of AC Milan is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK. Since William is a devotee of AC Milan, he falls under this category.\n- Therefore, based on Premise 2, William must be an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
