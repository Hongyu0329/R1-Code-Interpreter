    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is an ingredient of Eye Restore or an ingredient of 03 Bronzing Powder.\n2. Premise 2: No ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is an ingredient of 03 Bronzing Powder.\n\nConclusion: Being an ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is sufficient for being an ingredient of Eye Restore.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that each ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 must be found in either Eye Restore or 03 Bronzing Powder.\n- From Premise 2, we know that none of the ingredients of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 are found in 03 Bronzing Powder.\n\nGiven these two premises, the only logical conclusion is that every ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 must be an ingredient of Eye Restore. This is because the only other option (being an ingredient of 03 Bronzing Powder) is explicitly ruled out by Premise 2.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
