    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap is a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap, then they are a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a rare consumer of Camay soap is necessary for being a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap, then they are a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Not every infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo is both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n   - This implies that there exists at least one person who is an infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo and is not both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Necessarily, somebody is an infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo and not a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap.\n\nLet's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we can deduce that if someone is a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap, they must be both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n- Premise 3 states that not every infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo satisfies both conditions of being a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n- Therefore, there must be at least one infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo who does not meet both conditions. This means that this person cannot be a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap (since being a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap would imply meeting both conditions).\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
