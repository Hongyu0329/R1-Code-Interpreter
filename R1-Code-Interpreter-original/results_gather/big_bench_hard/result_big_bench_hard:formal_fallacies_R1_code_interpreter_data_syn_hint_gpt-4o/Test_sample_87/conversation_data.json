    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every owner of a Finesse shampoo is either a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap, or both.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone owns Finesse shampoo, then they are a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap, or both.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo is not a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or not a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo, then they are not a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or not a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is an owner of a Finesse shampoo is not a rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone owns Finesse shampoo, then they are not a rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 1, owning Finesse shampoo implies being a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap.\n- From Premise 2, being a rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo implies not being a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or not being a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\nThe conclusion states that owning Finesse shampoo implies not being a rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo. \n\nLet's analyze:\n- If someone owns Finesse shampoo, they must be a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap (or both).\n- If they were a rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo, they would not be a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or not a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap.\n- Therefore, if they are a regular consumer of TIGI shampoo or a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap, they cannot be a rare consumer of Alterna Haircare shampoo.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
