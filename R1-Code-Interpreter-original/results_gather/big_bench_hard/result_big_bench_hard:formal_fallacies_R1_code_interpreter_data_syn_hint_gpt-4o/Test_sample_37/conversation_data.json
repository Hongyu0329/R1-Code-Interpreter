    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Whoever is an uncle of Owen is not a nephew of Gene.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David is a schoolmate of Steve or an uncle of Owen.\n3. Premise 3: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Steve is a nephew of Gene.\n\nConclusion: Every brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is not a nephew of Gene.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David, they are either a schoolmate of Steve or an uncle of Owen.\n- From Premise 3, if they are a schoolmate of Steve, they are a nephew of Gene.\n- From Premise 1, if they are an uncle of Owen, they are not a nephew of Gene.\n\nThe conclusion states that every brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is not a nephew of Gene. \n\nTo validate this conclusion:\n- If a brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is a schoolmate of Steve, then according to Premise 3, they would be a nephew of Gene, which contradicts the conclusion.\n- Therefore, for the conclusion to hold, such a person must be an uncle of Owen (from Premise 2), which according to Premise 1, means they are not a nephew of Gene.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, as the only way for the conclusion to be true is if the person is an uncle of Owen, which aligns with the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
