    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument based on the given premises.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\n2. **Premise 2**: Nobody is neither a schoolmate of Tyler nor a nephew of Owen.\n\nThe second premise can be rephrased using logical terms: \"For any person, if they are not a schoolmate of Tyler, then they are a nephew of Owen.\" This is equivalent to saying that being a schoolmate of Tyler and being a nephew of Owen are mutually exclusive.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Cecil is not a nephew of Owen.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\n- According to Premise 2, if someone is a schoolmate of Tyler, they cannot be a nephew of Owen (since being a schoolmate of Tyler and being a nephew of Owen are mutually exclusive).\n- Therefore, based on these premises, the conclusion that Cecil is not a nephew of Owen logically follows.\n\nThe argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is the definition of a deductively valid argument.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
