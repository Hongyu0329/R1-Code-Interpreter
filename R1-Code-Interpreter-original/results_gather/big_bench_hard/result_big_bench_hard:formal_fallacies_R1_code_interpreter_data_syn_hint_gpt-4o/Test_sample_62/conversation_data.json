    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Some regular consumer of AXE shampoo is not an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n2. Everyone who is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap is an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Somebody is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From premise 1, we know there exists at least one person who regularly consumes AXE shampoo and does not occasionally purchase Sexy Hair shampoo.\n- From premise 2, we know that if someone is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows from these premises:\n\n- The conclusion states that there is someone who is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap.\n- From premise 1, we know there is someone who is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n- From premise 2, we know that if someone is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\nTherefore, the person mentioned in premise 1 cannot be a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap because if they were, they would have to be an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo, which contradicts premise 1.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
