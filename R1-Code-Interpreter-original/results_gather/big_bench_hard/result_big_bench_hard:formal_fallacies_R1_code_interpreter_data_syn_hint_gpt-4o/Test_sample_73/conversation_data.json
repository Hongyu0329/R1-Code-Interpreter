    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ex-fan of Villarreal CF is necessary for being a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, then they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Some supporter of Östersunds FK is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who supports Östersunds FK and is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Somebody is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n   - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one person who supports Östersunds FK and is not a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n- From Premise 2, we know there is at least one person who supports Östersunds FK and is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n- If this person is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF, according to Premise 1, they cannot be a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: there is indeed someone who supports Östersunds FK and is not a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
