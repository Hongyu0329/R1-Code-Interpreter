    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No devotee of FK Partizan is an expert of Southampton FC.\n2. **Premise 2**: No critic of FC Spartak Moskva is an expert of Southampton FC.\n3. **Premise 3**: To be a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan is necessary for being an admirer of Qarabağ FK.\n\n**Conclusion**: No admirer of Qarabağ FK is an expert of Southampton FC.\n\nLet's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 3, we know that anyone who admires Qarabağ FK must either be a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan (or both).\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a devotee of FK Partizan, they cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a critic of FC Spartak Moskva, they cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n\nGiven these premises, anyone who admires Qarabağ FK must fall into one of the two categories (or both) mentioned in Premise 3. Both categories (devotee of FK Partizan and critic of FC Spartak Moskva) are explicitly stated in Premises 1 and 2 as not being experts of Southampton FC. Therefore, it logically follows that no admirer of Qarabağ FK can be an expert of Southampton FC.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
