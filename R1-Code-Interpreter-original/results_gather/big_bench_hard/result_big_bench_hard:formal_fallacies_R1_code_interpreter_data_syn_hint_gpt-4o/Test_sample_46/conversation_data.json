    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No half-sister of Nelda is a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\n2. **Premise 2**: It is false that Gretchen is a close friend of Terrie.\n3. **Premise 3**: It is false that Gretchen is a cousin of Amanda.\n4. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Gretchen is a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a half-sister of Nelda, then they cannot be a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\n- Premise 2 and Premise 3 state that Gretchen is neither a close friend of Terrie nor a cousin of Amanda.\n\nGiven these premises, if Gretchen were a half-sister of Nelda, she would not be a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda, which is consistent with Premise 2 and Premise 3. Therefore, the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Gretchen is not a half-sister of Nelda. The premises are consistent with Gretchen being a half-sister of Nelda, as they do not contradict the conditions set by Premise 1.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
