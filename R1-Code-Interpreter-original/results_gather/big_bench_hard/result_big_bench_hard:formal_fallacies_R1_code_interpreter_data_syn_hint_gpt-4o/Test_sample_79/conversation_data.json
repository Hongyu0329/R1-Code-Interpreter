    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion logically.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Everyone who is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap is, however, a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Oliver is a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\nLet's break down the second premise: \n- It states that if someone is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap, then they are a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- This can be interpreted as a conditional statement: If not (A and B), then C, where:\n  - A = being a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo\n  - B = being a rare consumer of Purpose soap\n  - C = being a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo, which means A is false for Oliver.\n\nAccording to the second premise, if A is false, then the condition \"not (A and B)\" is true regardless of whether B is true or false. Therefore, the conclusion C (Oliver is a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap) must be true.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
