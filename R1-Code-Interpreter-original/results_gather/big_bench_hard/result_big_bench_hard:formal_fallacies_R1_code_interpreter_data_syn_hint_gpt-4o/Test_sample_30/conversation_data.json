    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, then they are either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is not an expert of SCR Altach, then they are a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC.\n   - This can be represented as: Everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, then they are a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they must be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n- From Premise 3, everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC. This means that if someone is not an opponent to West Ham United FC, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n- Combining Premise 1 and Premise 3, if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro and not an opponent to West Ham United FC, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is not an expert of SCR Altach, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n- Therefore, in all cases where someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC, either because they are not an opponent to West Ham United FC or because they are not an expert of SCR Altach.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<'valid'>>>"
