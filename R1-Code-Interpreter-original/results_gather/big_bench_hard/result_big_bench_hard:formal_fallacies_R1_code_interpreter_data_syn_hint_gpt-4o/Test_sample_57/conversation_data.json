Now, not being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is sufficient for not being an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig. Therefore, being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is necessary for being an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig is necessary for being an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB, then X is an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Not being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is sufficient for not being an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is not an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder, then X is not an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is necessary for being an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB, then X is an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: FACIAL SCRUB → Eye Definer Twig.\n- From Premise 2, we have: ¬NARS Pressed Powder → ¬Eye Definer Twig, which is logically equivalent to Eye Definer Twig → NARS Pressed Powder (contrapositive).\n\nCombining these:\n- FACIAL SCRUB → Eye Definer Twig (from Premise 1)\n- Eye Definer Twig → NARS Pressed Powder (from Premise 2)\n\nBy transitive reasoning, we can deduce:\n- FACIAL SCRUB → NARS Pressed Powder\n\nThis matches the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
