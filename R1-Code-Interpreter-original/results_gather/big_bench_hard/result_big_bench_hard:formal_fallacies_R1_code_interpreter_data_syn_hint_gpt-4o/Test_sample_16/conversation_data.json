Now, whoever is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is not an expert of BSC Young Boys. Hence, no friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Whoever is an expert of BSC Young Boys is not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an expert of BSC Young Boys, then they are not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is not an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, then they are not an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: No friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, then they are not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is an expert of BSC Young Boys, they cannot be an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n- Therefore, if someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, they cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys, and thus, by Premise 1, they cannot be an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
