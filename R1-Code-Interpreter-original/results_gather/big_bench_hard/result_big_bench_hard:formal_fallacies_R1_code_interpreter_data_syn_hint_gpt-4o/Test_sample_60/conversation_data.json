    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an opponent to OGC Nice.\n3. **Premise 3**: Some fan of Burnley FC is an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n\n**Conclusion**: Some fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945, they must be an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945, they must be an opponent to OGC Nice.\n- Premise 3 states that there exists a fan of Burnley FC who is both an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n\nThe conclusion claims that this fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945. \n\nFor the argument to be valid, the premises must lead to the conclusion necessarily. However, the premises only establish that there is a fan of Burnley FC who meets the conditions of being an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu. They do not establish that these conditions are sufficient for being an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945. The premises do not state that being an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu is enough to be an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<'invalid'>>>"
