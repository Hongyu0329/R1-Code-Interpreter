It follows that no great-grandfather of Ronny is an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: No son of Alexander who is an ancestor of Ahmed is a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n   - This means that if someone is both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed, then they cannot be a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: It follows that no great-grandfather of Ronny is an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n   - This conclusion is stating that if someone is a great-grandfather of Ronny, then they cannot be an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\n- The premise states a specific condition: being both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed excludes being a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n- The conclusion, however, makes a broader claim: being a great-grandfather of Ronny excludes being either an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the premise only excludes the intersection of two conditions (being both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed) from being a great-grandfather of Ronny. It does not exclude each condition independently. Therefore, the conclusion is making a broader claim than what the premise supports.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premise.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
