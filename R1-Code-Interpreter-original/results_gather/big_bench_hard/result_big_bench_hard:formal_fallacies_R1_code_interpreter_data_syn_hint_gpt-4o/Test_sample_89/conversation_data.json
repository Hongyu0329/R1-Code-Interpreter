    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Justin is not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn.\"\n   - This is a disjunction (either-or statement). It means at least one of the following is true:\n     - Justin is not an uncle of Roberto.\n     - Justin is not a workmate of Glenn.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Every great-grandfather of Reyes is an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\"\n   - This is a universal statement. It means if someone is a great-grandfather of Reyes, then they must be both:\n     - An uncle of Roberto.\n     - A workmate of Glenn.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"It is not the case that Justin is a great-grandfather of Reyes.\"\n   - This is a negation. It means Justin is not a great-grandfather of Reyes.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n- From Premise 2, if Justin were a great-grandfather of Reyes, he would have to be both an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\n- However, Premise 1 states that Justin is either not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn (or both).\n- Therefore, if Justin cannot satisfy both conditions required by Premise 2, he cannot be a great-grandfather of Reyes.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
