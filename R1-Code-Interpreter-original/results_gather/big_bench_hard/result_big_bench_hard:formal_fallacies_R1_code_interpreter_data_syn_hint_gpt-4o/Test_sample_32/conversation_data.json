  "question": "\"Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, everyone who is both an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK is a follower of Liverpool FC, too. Second, being an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is sufficient for not being an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol. Third, whoever is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK. In consequence, every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is both an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK is a follower of Liverpool FC.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an opponent to Real Sociedad and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş, then they are a follower of Liverpool.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is sufficient for not being an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski, then they are not an opponent to Real Sociedad.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski, then they are not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş.\n\n**Conclusion**: Every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski, they are not an opponent to Real Sociedad.\n- From Premise 3, if someone is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski, they are not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş.\n- Therefore, an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski cannot satisfy both conditions of being an opponent to Real Sociedad and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş simultaneously, which are required by Premise 1 to be a follower of Liverpool.\n\nThe conclusion that every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC does not logically follow from the premises because the conditions required by Premise 1 are not met by admirers of HŠK Zrinjski. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
