    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap or not being a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is sufficient for being an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 2, we can express it in logical terms as:\n  - If (Nick is a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap) OR (Nick is NOT a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap), then Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n\n- Therefore, the part of Premise 2 that says \"Nick is NOT a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap\" is false.\n\n- For the sufficient condition in Premise 2 to be true, the other part \"Nick is a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap\" must be true for Nick to be an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\n- However, the conclusion states that Nick is NOT an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nTo check for deductive validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- If Nick is not an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo, then the sufficient condition in Premise 2 must be false. This means both parts of the OR condition must be false:\n  - Nick is NOT a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap.\n  - Nick IS a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap (which we know from Premise 1).\n\nThe conclusion that Nick is not an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo is consistent with the premises, as the sufficient condition for being an occasional purchaser is not met.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
