    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a grandson of Dominic is a workmate of James.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan is a grandson of Dominic.\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a son of Cody or son of Ivan, is a workmate of James.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, then they are a grandson of Dominic.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a grandson of Dominic, then they are a workmate of James.\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can deduce that if someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, then they are a grandson of Dominic, and therefore, they are a workmate of James.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premises using logical deduction. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
