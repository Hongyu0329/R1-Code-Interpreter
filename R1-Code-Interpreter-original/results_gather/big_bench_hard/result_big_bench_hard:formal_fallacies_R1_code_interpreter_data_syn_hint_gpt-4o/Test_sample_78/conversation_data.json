    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Whoever is not a cousin of Andres is a workmate of Isaac.\n2. Premise 2: Nobody is neither a grandson of Reyes nor a workmate of Isaac. This means everyone is either a grandson of Reyes or a workmate of Isaac.\n3. Premise 3: No stepbrother of Phillip is both a grandson of Reyes and a cousin of Andres.\n\nConclusion: Being a workmate of Isaac is necessary for being a stepbrother of Phillip.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is not a cousin of Andres, they must be a workmate of Isaac.\n- From Premise 2, everyone must be either a grandson of Reyes or a workmate of Isaac.\n- From Premise 3, a stepbrother of Phillip cannot be both a grandson of Reyes and a cousin of Andres.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion is valid, we need to see if being a workmate of Isaac is the only option left for a stepbrother of Phillip:\n\n- If a stepbrother of Phillip were a cousin of Andres, they would not necessarily be a workmate of Isaac (Premise 1 does not apply).\n- If a stepbrother of Phillip were a grandson of Reyes, they cannot be a cousin of Andres (Premise 3).\n- Therefore, a stepbrother of Phillip must be a workmate of Isaac to satisfy Premise 2, as they cannot be a grandson of Reyes and a cousin of Andres simultaneously.\n\nThus, the conclusion that being a workmate of Isaac is necessary for being a stepbrother of Phillip follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
