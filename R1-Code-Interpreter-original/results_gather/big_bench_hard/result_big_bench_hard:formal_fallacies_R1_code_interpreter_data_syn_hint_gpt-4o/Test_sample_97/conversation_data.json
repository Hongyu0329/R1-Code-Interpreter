    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap is necessary for being a regular user of Nag Champa soap.\n   - This implies: If someone is a regular user of Nag Champa soap, then they must be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is at least one of these: a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n   - This implies: If someone is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo, then they are either a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: No regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap is a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - This implies: If someone is a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, then they cannot be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n**Conclusion**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n\n**Logical Analysis**:\n- From the second premise, a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo could be a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n- If they are a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, the third premise tells us they cannot be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- If they are a regular user of Nag Champa soap, the first premise tells us they must be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap, which contradicts the conclusion.\n- If they are a regular user of René Furterer shampoo, the conclusion states they should not be, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nThe conclusion states that a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo. However, the premises allow for the possibility of being a regular user of René Furterer shampoo, which contradicts the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
