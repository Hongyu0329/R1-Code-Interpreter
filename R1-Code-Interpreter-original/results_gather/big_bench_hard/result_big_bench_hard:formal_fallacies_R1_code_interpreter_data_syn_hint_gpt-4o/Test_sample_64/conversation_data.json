    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every fan of FC Lugano is neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a fan of FC Lugano, then they are not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva or ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, is a fan of FC Lugano.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, then they are a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nThe argument structure can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- The premise states a condition for being a fan of FC Lugano: not being a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not being an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n- The conclusion attempts to reverse this condition, suggesting that anyone who meets the condition (not being a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not being an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem) must be a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because all fans of FC Lugano meet a certain condition, it does not mean that everyone who meets that condition is a fan of FC Lugano. There could be other reasons or groups of people who also meet the condition but are not fans of FC Lugano.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
