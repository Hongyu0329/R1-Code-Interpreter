    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: It is false that Colleen is an ancestor of Cheryle.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is a stepsister of Esther is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n3. Conclusion: It follows that it is false that Colleen is a stepsister of Esther.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a stepsister of Esther, then they cannot be an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- Premise 1 states that Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n\nThe conclusion states that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther. For the argument to be valid, the premises must lead to this conclusion necessarily.\n\nLet's consider the logical implications:\n- If Colleen were a stepsister of Esther, then according to Premise 2, she would not be an ancestor of Cheryle, which is consistent with Premise 1.\n- However, Premise 1 alone does not provide any information about Colleen's relationship with Esther. It only states that Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n\nThe conclusion that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther does not necessarily follow from the premises. The premises do not provide enough information to deduce the conclusion with certainty. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
