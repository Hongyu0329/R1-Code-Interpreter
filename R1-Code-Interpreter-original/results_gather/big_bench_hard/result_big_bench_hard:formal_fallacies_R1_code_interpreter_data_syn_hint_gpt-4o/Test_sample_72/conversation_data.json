  "question": "\"Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a cousin of Lawrence is sufficient for being a schoolmate of Kenneth. Moreover, somebody is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth. All this entails that not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a cousin of Lawrence is sufficient for being a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a cousin of Lawrence, then they are a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Somebody is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is a close friend of Philip and is not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence.\n   - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one close friend of Philip who is not a cousin of Lawrence.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a cousin of Lawrence, they must be a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n- From Premise 2, we know there is a person who is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n- If this person is not a schoolmate of Kenneth, according to Premise 1, they cannot be a cousin of Lawrence.\n- Therefore, this person, who is a close friend of Philip, is not a cousin of Lawrence.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The existence of a close friend of Philip who is not a schoolmate of Kenneth directly implies that not every close friend of Philip can be a cousin of Lawrence, as being a cousin of Lawrence would require them to be a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
