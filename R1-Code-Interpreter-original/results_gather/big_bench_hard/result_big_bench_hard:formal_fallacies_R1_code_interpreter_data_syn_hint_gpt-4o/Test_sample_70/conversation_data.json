    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Terry is a grandson of Ward.\n2. **Second Premise**: Every grandson of Paul is an uncle of Earl and a grandson of Ward.\n3. **Conclusion**: Terry is a grandson of Paul.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- The first premise tells us that Terry is a grandson of Ward.\n- The second premise states that every grandson of Paul is both an uncle of Earl and a grandson of Ward.\n\nFrom the second premise, we can infer that if someone is a grandson of Paul, they must also be a grandson of Ward. However, the second premise does not state that every grandson of Ward is a grandson of Paul. It only states that every grandson of Paul is a grandson of Ward.\n\nThe conclusion that Terry is a grandson of Paul would require that every grandson of Ward is also a grandson of Paul, which is not supported by the premises. The premises only establish a one-way relationship: grandsons of Paul are grandsons of Ward, but not necessarily the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
