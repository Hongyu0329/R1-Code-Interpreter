    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Not being an opponent to FC Utrecht is sufficient for not being an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: If someone is not an opponent to FC Utrecht, then they are not an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\n   - In logical terms: If not Opponent(FC Utrecht), then not Admirer(St Johnstone FC).\n\n2. **Conclusion**: \"Everyone who is an admirer of St Johnstone FC is an opponent to FC Utrecht, too.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: If someone is an admirer of St Johnstone FC, then they are an opponent to FC Utrecht.\n   - In logical terms: If Admirer(St Johnstone FC), then Opponent(FC Utrecht).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: If not Opponent(FC Utrecht), then not Admirer(St Johnstone FC).\n- The contrapositive of this statement is: If Admirer(St Johnstone FC), then Opponent(FC Utrecht).\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion is a direct restatement of the contrapositive of Premise 1.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise through the contrapositive, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
