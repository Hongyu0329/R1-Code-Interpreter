    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an owner of a Lever soap or not being a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n3. **Conclusion**: Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 2, we can express it in logical terms:\n  - If Jonathan owns a Lever soap or Jonathan is not a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap, then Jonathan is a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\nThis can be written as:\n- (Lever soap owner OR NOT Eucalyptus soap consumer) â†’ Herbal Essences shampoo consumer\n\nGiven Premise 1, Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap. Therefore, the condition \"NOT Eucalyptus soap consumer\" is false.\n\nFor Jonathan to be a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo, the other condition \"Lever soap owner\" must be true. However, we have no information about whether Jonathan owns a Lever soap.\n\nThe conclusion states that Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo. For this to be true, both conditions in the sufficient condition must be false:\n- NOT Lever soap owner\n- Eucalyptus soap consumer (which is true)\n\nSince we don't have information about whether Jonathan owns a Lever soap, we cannot definitively conclude that Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo based solely on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid"
