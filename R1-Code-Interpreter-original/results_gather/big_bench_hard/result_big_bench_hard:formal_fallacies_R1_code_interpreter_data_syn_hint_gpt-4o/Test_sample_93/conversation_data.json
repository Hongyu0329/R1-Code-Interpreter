    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a friend of Kilmarnock FC is sufficient for not being an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a friend of Kilmarnock FC, then they are not an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - In logical terms: \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (where \\( F \\) is being a friend of Kilmarnock FC, and \\( A \\) is being an admirer of The New Saints FC).\n\n2. **Second Premise**: It is false that Maximo is an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: We may conclude that it is false that Maximo is a friend of Kilmarnock FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: \\( \\neg F \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that if Maximo were a friend of Kilmarnock FC (\\( F \\)), then he would not be an admirer of The New Saints FC (\\( \\neg A \\)).\n- The second premise tells us that Maximo is indeed not an admirer of The New Saints FC (\\( \\neg A \\)).\n- However, the conclusion claims that Maximo is not a friend of Kilmarnock FC (\\( \\neg F \\)).\n\nThe logical structure here is:\n- Premise: \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n- Premise: \\( \\neg A \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg F \\)\n\nThis is a classic example of affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because the consequent (\\( \\neg A \\)) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (\\( F \\)) is false. The premises do not logically lead to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid<<<answer>>>"
