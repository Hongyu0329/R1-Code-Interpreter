The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, if someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, then that person is not a backer of FC Augsburg or not a devotee of AS Monaco FC. Moreover, being a devotee of AS Monaco FC is necessary for not being a member of AC Milan. Finally, nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a backer of FC Augsburg.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, then that person is not a backer of FC Augsburg or not a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬Feyenoord → (¬Augsburg ∨ ¬Monaco)\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a devotee of AS Monaco FC is necessary for not being a member of AC Milan.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬Milan → Monaco\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a backer of FC Augsburg.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬(¬Milan ∧ ¬Augsburg), which simplifies to: Milan ∨ Augsburg\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a follower of Feyenoord.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬(¬Milan ∧ ¬Feyenoord), which simplifies to: Milan ∨ Feyenoord\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 3 (Milan ∨ Augsburg), we know that everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a backer of FC Augsburg.\n- From Premise 2 (¬Milan → Monaco), if someone is not a member of AC Milan, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n- From Premise 1 (¬Feyenoord → (¬Augsburg ∨ ¬Monaco)), if someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, they must either not be a backer of FC Augsburg or not a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If someone is a member of AC Milan, the conclusion (Milan ∨ Feyenoord) is satisfied.\n- If someone is not a member of AC Milan, by Premise 2, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n- If they are a devotee of AS Monaco FC, by Premise 1, if they are not a follower of Feyenoord, they cannot be a backer of FC Augsburg.\n- However, by Premise 3, they must be a backer of FC Augsburg if they are not a member of AC Milan.\n- Therefore, if they are not a member of AC Milan, they must be a follower of Feyenoord to satisfy all premises.\n\nIn all cases, the conclusion (Milan ∨ Feyenoord) holds true. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
