    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml is not an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n\n**Conclusion**: It is not the case that Vitamin A is an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 states that Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n- Premise 2 states that for any ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it must either not be an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not be an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n\nThe conclusion claims that Vitamin A is not an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises:\n\n- If Vitamin A were an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, then according to Premise 2, it must either not be an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not be an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n- However, Premise 1 states that Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n- Therefore, to satisfy Premise 2, Vitamin A cannot be an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, because it would contradict the condition that it must not be an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
