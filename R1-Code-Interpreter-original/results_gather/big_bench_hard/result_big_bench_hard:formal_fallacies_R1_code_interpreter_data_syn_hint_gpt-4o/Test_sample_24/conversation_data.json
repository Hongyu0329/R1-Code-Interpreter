    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n2. Nobody is neither a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n3. Every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From Premise 1, we can infer that if someone is not a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n- From Premise 2, we can infer that if someone is not a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n- Premise 3 states that every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"Being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap.\"\n\n- If someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, according to Premise 3, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n- If they are not a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap, by Premise 1, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n- If they are not a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo, by Premise 2, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\nThus, in both cases, being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
