    "To determine which option is a humorous edit of the name \"Whitney Houston,\" we need to analyze each option and see if it contains a play on words or a pun that could be considered humorous. \n\n1. **Option (A): whiney houston**\n   - The word \"whiney\" is a play on the word \"Whitney.\" \"Whiney\" suggests someone who whines or complains, which is a humorous twist on the original name. This option uses a pun to create humor.\n\n2. **Option (B): whitney housbon**\n   - This option changes \"Houston\" to \"Housbon,\" which does not create a recognizable pun or humorous effect. It seems more like a typographical error than a deliberate joke.\n\n3. **Option (C): whitneyx houston**\n   - The addition of \"x\" in \"whitneyx\" does not create a pun or humorous effect. It appears to be a random alteration rather than a humorous edit.\n\n4. **Option (D): whitney homston**\n   - This option changes \"Houston\" to \"Homston,\" which does not create a recognizable pun or humorous effect. Like option B, it seems more like a typographical error.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, option (A) \"whiney houston\" is the only one that uses a play on words to create a humorous effect. The humor comes from the pun on \"Whitney\" by changing it to \"whiney,\" which suggests a different meaning.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) whiney houston"
