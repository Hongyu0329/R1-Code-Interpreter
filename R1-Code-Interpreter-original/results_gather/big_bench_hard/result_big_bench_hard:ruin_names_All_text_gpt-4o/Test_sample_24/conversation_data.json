    "To determine which option is a humorous edit of the movie name \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" we need to analyze each option and see if it introduces a humorous twist or pun.\n\n1. **Original Name**: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is a well-known movie title. The humor in the options would likely come from a play on words or a pun.\n\n2. **Option (A): \"raiders of the last ark\"**\n   - This option changes \"lost\" to \"last.\" \n   - The change from \"lost\" to \"last\" doesn't introduce a humorous element or pun. It simply alters the meaning without adding humor.\n\n3. **Option (B): \"raiders of the lost irk\"**\n   - This option changes \"ark\" to \"irk.\"\n   - \"Irk\" is a word meaning to annoy or irritate, which creates a pun with the original title. \n   - This change introduces humor by playing on the word \"ark\" and replacing it with a word that sounds similar but has a different meaning.\n\n4. **Option (C): \"raidems of the lost ark\"**\n   - This option changes \"raiders\" to \"raidems.\"\n   - \"Raidems\" is not a recognized word and doesn't create a pun or humorous twist. It seems more like a typographical error.\n\n5. **Option (D): \"raiuders of the lost ark\"**\n   - This option changes \"raiders\" to \"raiuders.\"\n   - Similar to option (C), \"raiuders\" is not a recognized word and doesn't create a pun or humorous twist. It also seems like a typographical error.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, option (B) \"raiders of the lost irk\" is the only one that introduces a humorous element by creating a pun with the original title.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) raiders of the lost irk"
