    "To determine which option is a humorous edit of the movie name \"mean girls,\" we need to analyze each option and see how it alters the original name in a way that could be considered funny or amusing. \n\n1. **Option (A) bean girls**:\n   - This option changes the word \"mean\" to \"bean.\" \n   - The humor here comes from the play on words, as \"bean\" is a common food item and sounds similar to \"mean.\" \n   - This creates a funny mental image or pun, making it a humorous edit.\n\n2. **Option (B) oean girls**:\n   - This option changes the first letter \"m\" to \"o,\" resulting in \"oean.\"\n   - The word \"oean\" does not have any particular meaning or humorous connotation.\n   - This edit does not create a pun or amusing alteration, so it is not particularly funny.\n\n3. **Option (C) meyan girls**:\n   - This option changes the spelling of \"mean\" to \"meyan.\"\n   - The word \"meyan\" does not have a specific meaning or humorous implication.\n   - This edit does not create a pun or amusing alteration, so it is not particularly funny.\n\n4. **Option (D) mean giwls**:\n   - This option changes the spelling of \"girls\" to \"giwls.\"\n   - The word \"giwls\" is a misspelling of \"girls\" but does not create a pun or humorous effect.\n   - This edit does not have a humorous impact.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the one that stands out as a humorous edit is option (A) \"bean girls,\" due to the play on words and the amusing mental image it creates.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) bean girls"
