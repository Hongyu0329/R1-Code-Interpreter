    "\nassistant > To find the date 10 days ago from the current date, which is 2 days before June 1, 2021, we first determine the current date. Since the deadline is June 1, 2021, and it is 2 days away, the current date is May 30, 2021. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the date 10 days before May 30, 2021.\n\nMay 30, 2021 - 10 days = May 20, 2021.\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days ago is May 20, 2021, which corresponds to option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
