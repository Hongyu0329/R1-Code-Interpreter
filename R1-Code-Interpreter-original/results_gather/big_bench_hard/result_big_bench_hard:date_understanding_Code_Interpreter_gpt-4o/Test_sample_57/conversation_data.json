    "\nassistant > To determine the date one year ago from Jane's 16th birthday, we first need to establish the date of her 16th birthday. Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, which was a leap year. Therefore, her birthdate is February 29, 2000.\n\nSince today is her 16th birthday, we need to find the date 16 years after February 29, 2000. The year 2016 is also a leap year, so her 16th birthday would be on February 29, 2016.\n\nNow, we need to find the date one year before February 29, 2016. Since 2015 is not a leap year, February 28 is the last day of February in 2015. Therefore, one year before February 29, 2016, is February 28, 2015.\n\nThus, the date one year ago from today is 02/28/2015.\n\nThe correct option is (A) 02/28/2015.\n\n<<<02/28/2015>>>"
