    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols. The input sequence is `< { < > } { (`, and we need to determine the correct closing sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Symbols**: We have the following opening symbols in the sequence: `<`, `{`, `<`, `{`, and `(`.\n2. **Identify the Closing Symbols**: We have the following closing symbols in the sequence: `>`, `}`.\n3. **Match the Symbols**: We need to match each opening symbol with its corresponding closing symbol in the correct order:\n   - The first `<` is closed by the first `>`.\n   - The first `{` is closed by the first `}`.\n   - The second `<` is closed by the second `>`.\n   - The second `{` is closed by the second `}`.\n   - The `(` is closed by `)`.\n4. **Determine the Missing Closing Symbols**: Based on the sequence, we need to add the following closing symbols to complete the sequence: `>`, `}`, and `)`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence.\n\n```python\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< { < > } { (\"\n\n# Closing sequence to complete the input\nclosing_sequence = \"> } )\"\n\n# Complete sequence\ncomplete_sequence = input_sequence + closing_sequence\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{complete_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To dynamically determine the correct closing sequence, we can use a stack-based approach. This method involves iterating through the input sequence, using a stack to keep track of unmatched opening symbols, and then generating the necessary closing symbols to balance the sequence. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a list to simulate a stack to keep track of unmatched opening symbols.\n2. **Iterate Through the Input**: For each character in the input sequence:\n   - If it's an opening symbol (`<`, `{`, `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing symbol (`>`, `}`, `)`), pop the top of the stack (if the stack is not empty) to match it with the current closing symbol.\n3. **Generate Closing Sequence**: After processing the input, any remaining symbols in the stack need corresponding closing symbols. Pop each symbol from the stack and append its corresponding closing symbol to the result.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Combine the input sequence with the generated closing sequence and print the result.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\n# Define matching pairs for opening and closing symbols\nmatching_pairs = {\n    '<': '>',\n    '{': '}',\n    '(': ')'\n}\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< { < > } { (\"\n\n# Initialize a stack to keep track of unmatched opening symbols\nstack = []\n\n# Iterate through each character in the input sequence\nfor char in input_sequence:\n    if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening symbol\n        stack.append(char)\n    elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing symbol\n        if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n            stack.pop()  # Match found, pop from stack\n\n# Generate the closing sequence for unmatched opening symbols\nclosing_sequence = ''.join(matching_pairs[stack.pop()] for _ in range(len(stack)))\n\n# Complete sequence\ncomplete_sequence = input_sequence + closing_sequence\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{complete_sequence}>>>\")\n```"

    "The current solution attempts to solve the problem by appending a predefined closing sequence to the input. However, it does not dynamically determine the correct closing sequence based on the input. To improve the solution, consider implementing a stack-based approach to ensure that each opening symbol is properly matched with its corresponding closing symbol. This will involve iterating through the input sequence, using a stack to keep track of unmatched opening symbols, and then generating the necessary closing symbols to balance the sequence. This approach will provide a more robust and dynamic solution."
