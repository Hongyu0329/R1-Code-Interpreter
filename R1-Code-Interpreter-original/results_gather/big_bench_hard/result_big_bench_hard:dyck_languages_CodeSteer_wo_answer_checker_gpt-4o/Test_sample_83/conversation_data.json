    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets so that all types of brackets are properly closed. The input sequence is `{ < [ ]`, which contains an opening curly brace `{`, an opening angle bracket `<`, an opening square bracket `[`, and a closing square bracket `]`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the unmatched opening brackets: `{` and `<`.\n2. Close the unmatched opening brackets in the reverse order of their appearance to ensure proper nesting.\n3. The unmatched opening brackets are `{` and `<`, so we need to add `>` to close `<` and `}` to close `{`.\n4. The completed sequence will be `{ < [ ] > }`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"{ < [ ]\"\n\n# Complete the sequence by closing the unmatched brackets\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" > }\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
