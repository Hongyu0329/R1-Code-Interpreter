    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: `<`, `[`, `(`, `{`. Each type of bracket must be closed in the reverse order of their opening.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Traverse the input sequence character by character.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid (though the problem assumes the input is valid up to the point given).\n5. After processing the input, the stack will contain the unmatched opening brackets.\n6. Pop each element from the stack and append the corresponding closing bracket to the result.\n7. The result will be the completed sequence.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '(': ')', '{': '}'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by closing all remaining open brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ ( [ ( ) [ < [ < > ] < > [ ] > ] < < ( ) ( ) > < { } > > [ < > ] ]\"\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n# Print the result\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
    "Let's revisit the logic to ensure that we correctly match and close the brackets without adding unnecessary characters.
