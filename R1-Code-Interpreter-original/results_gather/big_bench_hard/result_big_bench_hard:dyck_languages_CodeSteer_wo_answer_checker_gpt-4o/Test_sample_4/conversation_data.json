    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, parentheses `( )`, curly braces `{ }`, and square brackets `[ ]`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the current sequence**: We have the sequence `< ( ( ( < > ) ) ( { { } [ { } ] [ ] < ( ) > } ) )`.\n\n2. **Count the opening and closing brackets**: \n   - Angle brackets `< >`: 2 opening `<` and 2 closing `>`.\n   - Parentheses `( )`: 4 opening `(` and 4 closing `)`.\n   - Curly braces `{ }`: 2 opening `{` and 2 closing `}`.\n   - Square brackets `[ ]`: 2 opening `[` and 2 closing `]`.\n\n3. **Check for balance**: The sequence is already balanced, meaning each type of opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n4. **Output the sequence**: Since the sequence is already balanced, we can output it as is.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the sequence in the required format.\n\n```python\nsequence = \"< ( ( ( < > ) ) ( { { } [ { } ] [ ] < ( ) > } ) )\"\nprint(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\n```"
