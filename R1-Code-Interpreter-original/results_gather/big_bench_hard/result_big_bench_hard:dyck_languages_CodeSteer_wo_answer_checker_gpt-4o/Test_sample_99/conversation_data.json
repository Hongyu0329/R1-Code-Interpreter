    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`. \n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Identify the opening brackets and their corresponding closing brackets.\n2. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. Traverse the input sequence and push each opening bracket onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, pop the top of the stack and check if it matches the expected closing bracket.\n5. If the stack is empty after processing the input, the sequence is balanced. Otherwise, add the necessary closing brackets to balance the sequence.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs for brackets\n    matching_brackets = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>'\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets to balance the sequence\n    result = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        result += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{result}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( ( ( ( [ [ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ] ] ( ) ) )\"\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n# Print the result\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
