    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. The input sequence is `< [ [`, which consists of:\n\n- One `<` (angle bracket)\n- Two `[` (square brackets)\n\nTo properly close these brackets, we need to add:\n\n- One `>` to close the `<`\n- Two `]` to close the two `[` brackets\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `< [ [ ] ] >`.\n\nNow, let's write a Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ [\"\n\n# Define the closing sequence needed to balance the input\nclosing_sequence = \"] ] >\"\n\n# Combine the input and closing sequences\ncompleted_sequence = input_sequence + closing_sequence\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
