    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses so that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The input sequence is `[ { < ( ) > }`. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `[`: This is an opening square bracket. It needs a corresponding closing square bracket `]`.\n2. `{`: This is an opening curly brace. It needs a corresponding closing curly brace `}`.\n3. `<`: This is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n4. `(`: This is an opening parenthesis. It needs a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.\n5. `)`: This is a closing parenthesis, which matches the last opened parenthesis.\n6. `>`: This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the last opened angle bracket.\n7. `}`: This is a closing curly brace, which matches the last opened curly brace.\n\nThe sequence is missing a closing square bracket `]` to match the first opening square bracket. Therefore, the completed sequence should be `[ { < ( ) > } ]`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"[ { < ( ) > } ]\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
