    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The input sequence is:\n\n```\n< { ( { } ) < > }\n```\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` is opened and not yet closed.\n2. `{` is opened and closed with `}`.\n3. `(` is opened and closed with `)`.\n4. `{` is opened and closed with `}`.\n5. `<` is opened and closed with `>`.\n6. `}` is closed, matching the earlier `{`.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `<` is still open.\n\nThus, we need to add a `>` at the end to close the first `<`.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n```\n< { ( { } ) < > } >\n```\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"< { ( { } ) < > } >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "Thank you for pointing that out. Let's adjust the code to ensure the output format matches the required format by removing the extra angle brackets.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"< { ( { } ) < > } >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<{completed_sequence}>>\")\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.

    "The current solution correctly identifies the need to close the remaining open bracket and provides the correct completed sequence. However, the output format in the code is incorrect, resulting in an extra pair of angle brackets. Please adjust the code to ensure the output format matches the required format by removing the extra angle brackets."
