    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, and square brackets `[]`. We need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket, ensuring that the order is maintained.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input string character by character.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character:\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid.\n4. After processing all characters, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and we need to add the corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n5. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'{': '}', '<': '>', '[': ']'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"  # Mismatched or unbalanced\n    \n    # If stack is not empty, we need to add closing brackets\n    completion = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Construct the final answer\n    final_answer = input_sequence + completion\n    return f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ ( { { < { < > } > } < { } > < < < [ < [ ] > ] > > >\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
