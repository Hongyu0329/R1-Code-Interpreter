    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: `<`, `{`, `[`, and `(`. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket: `>`, `}`, `]`, and `)` respectively.\n\nHere's the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through the given sequence:\n   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket, pop the top of the stack and check if it matches the current closing bracket. If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid.\n3. After processing the input sequence, the stack will contain the unmatched opening brackets. We need to add the corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n4. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input sequence.\n5. Output the completed sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs of brackets\n    matching_brackets = {'<': '>', '{': '}', '[': ']', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< { } [ [ ( ( < { < { [ ] } > } > ) )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all parentheses properly closed.",
    "Let's revisit the logic and ensure that the stack operations correctly handle all types of brackets.

Iterate through the input sequence:\n   - Push opening brackets onto the stack.\n   - For closing brackets, check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it matches, pop the stack.\n3. After processing the input, the stack will contain unmatched opening brackets. For each unmatched opening bracket, append the corresponding closing bracket to the sequence.\n4. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input sequence.\n5.
