    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and balanced. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: round `()`, square `[]`, curly `{}`, and angle `<>`. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and they must be properly nested.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Traverse the sequence character by character.\n3. When encountering an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, the sequence is unbalanced.\n5. After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if the sequence is balanced.\n6. If the sequence is balanced, output the sequence as it is. If not, indicate that the sequence is unbalanced.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in \"([{<\":\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in \")]}>\":\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return False\n    \n    return not stack\n\nsequence = \"( ( ( [ < [ < [ ( [ { < ( < ( ( ) ) { } [ ] > ) > } ] ) { < > } ] [ < [ { ( < < { { [ < { [ [ < > [ ] ] ] } > ] { { } } } } > > ) } ] > { < > { } } ] > ( [ ] ) ] > ] ) ( )\"\n\nif is_balanced(sequence):\n    print(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The sequence is unbalanced.\")\n```\n\nThis code checks if the given sequence is balanced and outputs it in the required format if it is.",
    "To complete the sequence, we need to track unmatched opening brackets and append the corresponding closing brackets at the end of the sequence. Here's the plan:\n\n1.

When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, the sequence is unbalanced.\n5. After processing all characters, the stack will contain unmatched opening brackets.\n6. Append the corresponding closing brackets for each unmatched opening bracket in the stack to complete the sequence.\n7. Output the completed sequence.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    opening_bracket = {v: k for k, v in matching_bracket.items()}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in \"([{<\":\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in \")]}>\":\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"The sequence is unbalanced and cannot be completed.\"\n    \n    # Append the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ''.join(opening_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\nsequence = \"( ( ( [ < [ < [ ( [ { < ( < ( ( ) ) { } [ ] > ) > } ] ) { < > } ] [ < [ { ( < < { { [ < { [ [ < > [ ] ] ] } > ] { { } } } } > > ) } ] > { < > { } } ] > ( [ ] ) ] > ] ) ( )\"\n\nprint(complete_sequence(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will complete the sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets and output it in the required format."

    "The current approach correctly identifies whether the sequence is balanced but does not attempt to complete the sequence if it is unbalanced. To improve the solution, modify the code to not only check for balance but also to suggest the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence. Consider implementing a mechanism to track unmatched opening brackets and append the corresponding closing brackets at the end of the sequence. This will ensure the sequence is properly closed and balanced."
