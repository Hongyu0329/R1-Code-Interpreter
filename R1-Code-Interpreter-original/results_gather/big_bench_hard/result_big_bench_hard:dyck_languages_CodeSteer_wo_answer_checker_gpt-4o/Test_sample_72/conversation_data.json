    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The input sequence is:\n\n```\n{ { [ { < { } > } ( ) ]\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{` - Open curly brace\n2. `{` - Open curly brace\n3. `[` - Open square bracket\n4. `{` - Open curly brace\n5. `<` - Open angle bracket\n6. `{ }` - Complete curly brace pair\n7. `>` - Close angle bracket\n8. `}` - Close curly brace\n9. `(` - Open parenthesis\n10. `)` - Close parenthesis\n11. `]` - Close square bracket\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- The last opened bracket that is not closed is `{`, so we need to close it with `}`.\n- The next is another `{`, so we close it with `}`.\n\nThe completed sequence should be:\n\n```\n{ { [ { < { } > } ( ) ] } }\n```\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\ncompleted_sequence = \"{ { [ { < { } > } ( ) ] } }\"\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
