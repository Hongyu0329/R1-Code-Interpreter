    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is `[ [ < < { } >`. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `[`: This is an opening square bracket. It needs a corresponding closing square bracket `]`.\n2. `[`: Another opening square bracket. It also needs a closing square bracket `]`.\n3. `<`: This is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n4. `<`: Another opening angle bracket. It also needs a closing angle bracket `>`.\n5. `{`: This is an opening curly brace. It needs a corresponding closing curly brace `}`.\n6. `}`: This is a closing curly brace, which matches the last opening curly brace.\n7. `>`: This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the last opening angle bracket.\n\nNow, let's determine the missing closing brackets:\n\n- We have two opening square brackets `[` that need to be closed with `]`.\n- We have one opening angle bracket `<` that needs to be closed with `>`.\n- We have one opening angle bracket `<` that needs to be closed with `>`.\n\nThe completed sequence should be: `[ [ < < { } > > ] ]`\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"[ [ < < { } > > ] ]\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
