    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses so that all of them are properly closed. The input sequence is:\n\n```\n( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) }\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. We have two opening parentheses `(`, which are closed by two closing parentheses `)`.\n2. We have an opening square bracket `[`, which is not yet closed.\n3. We have an opening curly brace `{`, which is not yet closed.\n4. We have an opening parenthesis `(`, which is closed by a closing parenthesis `)`.\n5. We have an opening angle bracket `<`, which is closed by a closing angle bracket `>`.\n6. We have a closing curly brace `}`, which closes the previously opened `{`.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The square bracket `[` needs a closing `]`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be:\n\n```\n( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]\n```\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\ncompleted_sequence = \"( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]\"\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
