    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of curly braces is balanced. This means that every opening brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}`. The input sequence is `{ { { } }`, which has three opening braces and only one closing brace. Therefore, we need to add two more closing braces to balance the sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Count the number of opening braces `{`.\n2. Count the number of closing braces `}`.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of opening and closing braces.\n4. Add the required number of closing braces `}` to balance the sequence.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Input sequence\nsequence = \"{ { { } }\"\n\n# Count the number of opening and closing braces\nopening_braces = sequence.count('{')\nclosing_braces = sequence.count('}')\n\n# Calculate the number of closing braces needed\nneeded_closing_braces = opening_braces - closing_braces\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding the needed closing braces\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + '}' * needed_closing_braces\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
