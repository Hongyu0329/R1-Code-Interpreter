    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and balanced. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, parentheses `( )`, and curly braces `{ }`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence:\n   - If an opening bracket is encountered, push it onto the stack.\n   - If a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is already invalid, but since the input is assumed to be valid up to the point given, this shouldn't happen.\n3. After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n4. Append the necessary closing brackets to the sequence to balance it.\n5. Output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ < [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ] > ] < ( ) > ( ( ( ) ) ) ( < >\"\n\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed and balanced."
