    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses, brackets, and braces is properly closed. The input sequence is:\n\n`< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] )`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis.\n3. `[ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ]` - This part is already balanced with:\n   - Four opening square brackets `[[[[` and four closing square brackets `]]]]`.\n   - One pair of parentheses `( )`.\n   - One pair of curly braces `{ }`.\n4. `)` - This is a closing parenthesis.\n\nThe sequence starts with an opening angle bracket `<` and ends with a closing parenthesis `)`. To properly close the sequence, we need to add a closing angle bracket `>` at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence should be:\n\n`< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] ) >`\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] ) >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To ensure the sequence is properly balanced and closed, we can use a stack-based approach to verify the balance of the sequence programmatically. This approach will help us ensure that every opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol in the correct order. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack to keep track of opening symbols.\n2. Iterate through each character in the sequence.\n3. Push opening symbols onto the stack.\n4. When encountering a closing symbol, check if it matches the top of the stack.\n5. If it matches, pop the stack; otherwise, the sequence is unbalanced.\n6. After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if the sequence is balanced.\n7.
