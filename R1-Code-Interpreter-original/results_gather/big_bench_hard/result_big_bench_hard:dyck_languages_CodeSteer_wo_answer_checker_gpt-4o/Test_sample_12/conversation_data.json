    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: round `()`, square `[]`, and curly `{}`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. This will help us determine which closing bracket is needed next.\n2. **Iterate through the Input**: Go through each character in the input sequence.\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`<`, `[`, `(`, `{`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`>`, `]`, `)`, `}`), pop the stack to check if it matches the expected closing bracket for the last opened one.\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input, the stack will contain any unmatched opening brackets. For each of these, append the corresponding closing bracket to the sequence.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                # This should not happen in a well-formed input\n                return \"Error: Unmatched closing bracket\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ < [ ( ( ) < ( ) > ( { { } } [ [ [ < ( [ ] ) ( ) > ] ] ] { { { { { } } } { { } { < [ [ ] ] > } } { } } } ) ) ] >\"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all parentheses, brackets, and braces properly closed."
