    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is `{ } < { } < > (`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the types of brackets used: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, and parentheses `()`.\n2. Count the opening and closing brackets for each type:\n   - Curly braces `{}`: 2 opening `{` and 2 closing `}`.\n   - Angle brackets `<>`: 1 opening `<` and 1 closing `>`.\n   - Parentheses `()`: 1 opening `(` and 0 closing `)`.\n3. To properly close all brackets, we need to add one closing parenthesis `)` at the end of the sequence.\n4. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing parenthesis.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"{ } < { } < > (\"\n\n# Add the missing closing parenthesis\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \")\"\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
