    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses so that all of them are properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, angle brackets `<>`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input sequence from left to right.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid (but we assume the input is valid up to the point given).\n4. After processing the input, the stack will contain unmatched opening brackets. We need to add the corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n5. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '<': '>',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Construct the final sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completion = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    final_sequence = input_sequence + completion\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    print(f\"<<<{final_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( ( < [ { { } } ] > { } ) ( < > ) [ ( < > ) ] <\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
