    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that each type of bracket is properly closed in the correct order. The sequence starts with an opening square bracket `[`, followed by an opening curly brace `{`, another `{`, an opening angle bracket `<`, an opening parenthesis `(`, a closing parenthesis `)`, a closing angle bracket `>`, a closing curly brace `}`, and another closing curly brace `}`. \n\nThe sequence so far is: `[ { { < ( ) > } }`\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to close the initial square bracket with a `]`. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Identify the unmatched opening brackets.\n2. Add the corresponding closing brackets in the correct order.\n\nThe unmatched opening bracket is `[`, so we need to add a `]` at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `[ { { < ( ) > } } ]`\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\nsequence = \"[ { { < ( ) > } } ]\"\nprint(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\n```"
