    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that they are properly closed. The input sequence is `< [ ]`, which means we have an opening angle bracket `<` and a pair of square brackets `[ ]` that are already closed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the opening brackets: `<` and `[`.\n2. The square brackets `[ ]` are already closed, so we don't need to do anything with them.\n3. The angle bracket `<` needs to be closed with a `>`.\n4. The final sequence should be `< [ ] >`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"< [ ]\"\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding the closing angle bracket\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To complete the sequence `< [ ]`, we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Identify the opening brackets: `<` and `[`.\n2. The square brackets `[ ]` are already closed, so they are balanced.\n3. The angle bracket `<` needs to be closed with a `>`.\n4. The final sequence should be `< [ ] >`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"< [ ]\"\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding the closing angle bracket\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
