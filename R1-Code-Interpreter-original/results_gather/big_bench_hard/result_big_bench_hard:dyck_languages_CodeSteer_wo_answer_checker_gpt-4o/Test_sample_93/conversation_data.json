    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are properly closed. The sequence consists of angle brackets `< >` and square brackets `[ ]`. We need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Unmatched Brackets**: We need to find out which brackets are unmatched in the given sequence.\n2. **Balance the Brackets**: For each unmatched opening bracket, add the corresponding closing bracket at the end of the sequence.\n3. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence with the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in \"<[\":\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == \">\":\n            if stack and stack[-1] == \"<\":\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                stack.append(char)\n        elif char == \"]\":\n            if stack and stack[-1] == \"[\":\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                stack.append(char)\n\n    # Now, stack contains unmatched opening brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        char = stack.pop()\n        if char == \"<\":\n            completed_sequence += \">\"\n        elif char == \"[\":\n            completed_sequence += \"]\"\n\n    return completed_sequence\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< > [ [ < [ ] > ]\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure all brackets are properly matched and closed.",
    "Let's revisit the problem and ensure that we correctly balance the brackets in the sequence. The goal is to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\nHere's a refined plan:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets.\n2. **Process Each Character**: Iterate through each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`<` or `[`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`>` or `]`), check if the stack's top matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is already invalid, but since we are completing it, we can ignore this case.\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing all characters, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets added to the end of the sequence.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    completed_sequence = list(sequence)  # Convert to list for easier manipulation\n\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in \"<[\":\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == \">\":\n            if stack and stack[-1] == \"<\":\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If there's a mismatch, we ignore it for completion purposes\n                continue\n        elif char == \"]\":\n            if stack and stack[-1] == \"[\":\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If there's a mismatch, we ignore it for completion purposes\n                continue\n\n    # Add the necessary closing brackets for unmatched opening brackets\n    while stack:\n        char = stack.pop()\n        if char == \"<\":\n            completed_sequence.append(\">\")\n        elif char == \"[\":\n            completed_sequence.append(\"]\")\n\n    return ''.join(completed_sequence)\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< > [ [ < [ ] > ]\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should correctly complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure all brackets are properly matched and closed.",
