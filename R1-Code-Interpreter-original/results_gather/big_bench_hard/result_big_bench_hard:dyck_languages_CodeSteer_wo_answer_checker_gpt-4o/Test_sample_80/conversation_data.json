    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is a nested structure of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input sequence from left to right.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`<`, `[`, `{`, `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`>`, `]`, `}`, `)`), pop the top of the stack and check if it matches the current closing bracket. If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid (but for this task, we assume the input is valid up to the point given).\n4. After processing the input, the stack will contain unmatched opening brackets. These need to be closed in the reverse order of their appearance.\n5. Construct the closing sequence by popping from the stack and appending the corresponding closing bracket.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Construct the closing sequence\n    closing_sequence = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    print(f\"<<<{closing_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ < [ { { < > [ ( ) ] ( ( ) ) } } ] > ] { { { ( < > )\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence, ensuring all parentheses are properly closed.",
