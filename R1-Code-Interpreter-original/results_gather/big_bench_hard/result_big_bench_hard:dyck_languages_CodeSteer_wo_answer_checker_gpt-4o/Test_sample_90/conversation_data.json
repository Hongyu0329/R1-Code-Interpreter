    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, square brackets `[]`, and parentheses `()`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Traverse the input sequence character by character.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid (but we assume the input is valid up to the point given).\n5. After processing the input, the stack will contain unmatched opening brackets.\n6. Pop each unmatched opening bracket from the stack and append the corresponding closing bracket to the sequence.\n7. Print the completed sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'{': '}', '<': '>', '[': ']', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_pairs[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ < ( [ ( ( [ < { ( { } ) } < < > > > ] ) ) ] ) >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all parentheses properly closed."
