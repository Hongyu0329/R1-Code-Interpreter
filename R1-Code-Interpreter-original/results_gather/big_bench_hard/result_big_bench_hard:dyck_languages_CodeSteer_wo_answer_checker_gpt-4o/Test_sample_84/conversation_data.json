    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\nInput: ( { } ) < { < { } >\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The sequence starts with `(`, which is closed by `)`.\n2. Inside the parentheses, there is `{ }`, which is already balanced.\n3. After the parentheses, there is `<`, which needs to be closed by `>`.\n4. Inside the angle brackets, there is `{`, which needs to be closed by `}`.\n5. Inside the curly braces, there is `<`, which needs to be closed by `>`.\n\nNow, let's complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets:\n\n- The sequence starts with `(` and ends with `)`, so it's balanced.\n- The sequence has `{ }` inside the parentheses, which is balanced.\n- After the parentheses, there is `<`, which needs to be closed by `>`.\n- Inside the angle brackets, there is `{`, which needs to be closed by `}`.\n- Inside the curly braces, there is `<`, which needs to be closed by `>`.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `( { } ) < { < { } > } >`\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the required format.\n\n```python\ncompleted_sequence = \"( { } ) < { < { } > } >\"\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a stack, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, the sequence is invalid (but since we are completing it, we will just continue).\n5. After processing all characters, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets added to the sequence.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Result list to build the completed sequence\n    result = []\n\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n            result.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, check the stack\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            result.append(char)\n        else:\n            # Add any non-bracket characters directly to the result\n            result.append(char)\n\n    # Add the necessary closing brackets for any remaining opening brackets\n    while stack:\n        result.append(matching_brackets[stack.pop()])\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\ninput_sequence = \"( { } ) < { < { } >\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will correctly complete the sequence by ensuring all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order.",

    "The current solution is incorrect because it does not properly close all the brackets. The sequence should be completed by ensuring that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. Consider using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and ensure they are closed in the correct order. This approach will help in managing the nested structure of the brackets more effectively. Please revise the solution to incorporate this method and ensure all brackets are properly closed.",
