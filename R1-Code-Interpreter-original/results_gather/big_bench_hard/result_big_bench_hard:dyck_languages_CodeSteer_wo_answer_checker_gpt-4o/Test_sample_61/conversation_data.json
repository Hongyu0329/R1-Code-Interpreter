    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, parentheses `()`, and square brackets `[]`. Our task is to check if the sequence is balanced and complete it if necessary.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Traverse the sequence character by character.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is unbalanced.\n5. After processing all characters, if the stack is not empty, the sequence is incomplete, and we need to add the corresponding closing brackets to balance it.\n6. Output the completed sequence.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'{': '}', '(': ')', '[': ']', '<': '>'}\n    opening_brackets = set(matching_brackets.keys())\n    closing_brackets = set(matching_brackets.values())\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in opening_brackets:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in closing_brackets:\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Unbalanced sequence\n                return \"Unbalanced sequence\"\n    \n    # If stack is not empty, add the necessary closing brackets\n    while stack:\n        sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return sequence\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ < { ( { [ ] } ) } > { } ( [ { { { ( [ < > ] ) } } } ] ) { { ( { } ) } }\"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence is balanced and complete it if necessary, then output the completed sequence in the specified format."
