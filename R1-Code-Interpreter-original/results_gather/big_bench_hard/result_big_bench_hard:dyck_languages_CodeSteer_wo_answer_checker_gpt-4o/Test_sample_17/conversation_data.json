    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses such that all opened parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is `< ( ( )`. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Count the Parentheses**: We need to count the number of each type of parenthesis. Specifically, we need to count the number of opening parentheses `(` and closing parentheses `)`.\n\n2. **Balance the Parentheses**: For each opening parenthesis `(`, there should be a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`. We need to determine how many closing parentheses are needed to balance the sequence.\n\n3. **Construct the Output**: We will construct the output by appending the necessary number of closing parentheses to the input sequence.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output as `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_parentheses(sequence):\n    # Count the number of opening and closing parentheses\n    open_count = sequence.count('(')\n    close_count = sequence.count(')')\n    \n    # Calculate the number of closing parentheses needed\n    needed_closing = open_count - close_count\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_closing\n    \n    # Format the output\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< ( ( )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_parentheses(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses in the specified format.",
    "To solve the problem of completing the sequence of parentheses, we need to ensure that every opening parenthesis `(` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The input sequence is `< ( ( )`.\n\n2. **Count Parentheses**: We need to count the number of opening `(` and closing `)` parentheses.\n\n3. **Determine Missing Parentheses**: Calculate how many closing parentheses are needed to balance the sequence.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence**: Append the necessary number of closing parentheses to the sequence.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Present the completed sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_parentheses(sequence):\n    # Count the number of opening and closing parentheses\n    open_count = sequence.count('(')\n    close_count = sequence.count(')')\n    \n    # Calculate the number of closing parentheses needed\n    needed_closing = open_count - close_count\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_closing\n    \n    # Format the output\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< ( ( )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_parentheses(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses in the specified format.",
    "To address the problem correctly, we need to consider the input format, which includes a `<` character, and ensure that the parentheses are balanced. The `<` character is not part of the parentheses balancing logic, so we should focus on balancing the parentheses `(` and `)` only.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. **Parse the Input**: Identify and separate the `<` character from the parentheses sequence.\n\n2. **Count Parentheses**: Count the number of opening `(` and closing `)` parentheses.\n\n3. **Balance the Parentheses**: Determine how many additional closing parentheses `)` are needed to balance the sequence.\n\n4. **Construct the Output**: Append the necessary number of closing parentheses to the sequence.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Present the completed sequence in the format `<<<balanced_sequence>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_parentheses(sequence):\n    # Remove the '<' character from the sequence\n    sequence = sequence.replace('<', '').strip()\n    \n    # Count the number of opening and closing parentheses\n    open_count = sequence.count('(')\n    close_count = sequence.count(')')\n    \n    # Calculate the number of closing parentheses needed\n    needed_closing = open_count - close_count\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_closing\n    \n    # Format the output\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< ( ( )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_parentheses(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly handle the input format, balance the parentheses, and output the result in the specified format.",
    "To implement a more robust solution using a stack-based approach, we can efficiently manage the balancing of parentheses. This method will help us track unmatched parentheses and ensure that the sequence is balanced correctly. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of unmatched opening parentheses `(`.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Sequence**: For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening parenthesis `(`, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing parenthesis `)`, pop an element from the stack if the stack is not empty (indicating a match).\n\n3. **Determine Unmatched Parentheses**: After processing the sequence, the stack will contain unmatched opening parentheses. The number of elements in the stack will tell us how many closing parentheses are needed.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence**: Append the necessary number of closing parentheses to the sequence.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Present the completed sequence in the format `<<<balanced_sequence>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_parentheses(sequence):\n    # Remove the '<' character from the sequence\n    sequence = sequence.replace('<', '').strip()\n    \n    # Initialize a stack to track unmatched opening parentheses\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            if stack:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Calculate the number of closing parentheses needed\n    needed_closing = len(stack)\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_closing\n    \n    # Format the output\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< ( ( )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_parentheses(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to efficiently manage the balancing of parentheses and outputs the result in the specified format."

    "The current solution does not correctly handle the input format and does not produce the expected output. The input sequence includes a '<' character, which is not being addressed in the solution. Additionally, the output format is incorrect as it includes an extra '<' character. Please revise the code to correctly handle the input format and ensure the output is in the correct format. Consider using more complex logic to parse and handle the input sequence properly, ensuring that all characters are accounted for and the parentheses are balanced correctly.",
    "The current solution correctly handles the input format by removing the '<' character and balances the parentheses. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code could benefit from more sophisticated symbolic computing techniques. Consider implementing a stack-based approach to manage the parentheses balancing, which can provide a more robust solution for complex sequences. This approach will help in efficiently tracking unmatched parentheses and ensure that the sequence is balanced correctly. Additionally, ensure that the output format strictly adheres to the requirements."
