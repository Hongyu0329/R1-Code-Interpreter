    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Identify the unmatched opening brackets in the sequence.\n2. Add the corresponding closing brackets in the correct order to complete the sequence.\n3. Ensure that the sequence is balanced and all brackets are properly closed.\n\nLet's break down the input sequence:\n\n- `(`: Needs a `)`\n- `[` (first level): Needs a `]`\n- `[` (second level): Needs a `]`\n- `{`: Already closed with `}`\n- `]` (second level): Already closed\n- `]` (first level): Already closed\n- `{`: Needs a `}`\n- `<`: Needs a `>`\n- `[` (third level): Needs a `]`\n- `<`: Needs a `>`\n- `[` (fourth level): Needs a `]`\n- `{`: Already closed with `}`\n- `]` (fourth level): Already closed\n- `>`: Already closed\n- `]` (third level): Already closed\n- `>`: Already closed\n- `}`: Needs a `}`\n- `)`: Needs a `)`\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to complete the sequence and output the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > }\"\n\n# Closing brackets needed to complete the sequence\nclosing_sequence = \"})\"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncomplete_sequence = input_sequence + closing_sequence\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{complete_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To improve the solution using a stack-based approach, we can utilize a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. As we iterate through the sequence, we'll push opening brackets onto the stack and pop them when we encounter their corresponding closing brackets. This will help us ensure that the sequence is balanced and properly nested.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Define a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.\n3. Iterate through each character in the input sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n4. After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets.\n5. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input sequence.\n6. Output the final sequence in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > }\"\n\n# Define matching pairs for brackets\nmatching_brackets = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n\n# Stack to keep track of opening brackets\nstack = []\n\n# Iterate through each character in the input sequence\nfor char in input_sequence:\n    if char in \"([{<\":\n        # Push opening brackets onto the stack\n        stack.append(char)\n    elif char in \")]}>\":\n        # Check if the stack is not empty and matches the corresponding opening bracket\n        if stack and stack[-1] == matching_brackets[char]:\n            stack.pop()\n\n# Construct the closing sequence needed to balance the input\nclosing_sequence = \"\"\n# Map opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets\nclosing_map = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\nwhile stack:\n    opening_bracket = stack.pop()\n    closing_sequence += closing_map[opening_bracket]\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncomplete_sequence = input_sequence + closing_sequence\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{complete_sequence}>>>\")\n```"

    "The current solution correctly identifies the unmatched opening brackets and appends the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code lacks symbolic computing and efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a stack-based approach to dynamically match and close brackets. This will ensure that the sequence is balanced and properly nested. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, utilizing data structures like stacks to handle the bracket matching process."
