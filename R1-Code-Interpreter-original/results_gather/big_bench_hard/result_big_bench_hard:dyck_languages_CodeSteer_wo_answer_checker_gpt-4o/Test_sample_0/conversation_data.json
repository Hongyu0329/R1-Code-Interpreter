    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets, ensuring that all parentheses are properly closed. The input is a list containing an open bracket, and we need to determine the correct sequence of brackets that would properly close the open ones.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list containing an open bracket `[`. This suggests that we need to close this bracket properly.\n\n2. **Determine the Output**: Since we have one open bracket, we need to add a closing bracket `]` to complete the sequence.\n\n3. **Format the Output**: The final output should be formatted as `<<<answer>>>`, where `answer` is the completed sequence of brackets.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Initial input\ninput_sequence = [\"[\"]\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding a closing bracket\ncompleted_sequence = input_sequence + [\"]\"]\n\n# Format the output\nanswer = \"\".join(completed_sequence)\nprint(f\"<<<{answer}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence of brackets in the required format."
