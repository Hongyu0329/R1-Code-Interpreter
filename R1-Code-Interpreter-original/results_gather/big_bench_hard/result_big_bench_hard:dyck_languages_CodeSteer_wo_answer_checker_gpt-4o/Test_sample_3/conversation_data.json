    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n`< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { }`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - Opening angle bracket\n2. `[` - Opening square bracket\n3. `]` - Closing square bracket (matches the second character)\n4. `{` - Opening curly brace\n5. `<` - Opening angle bracket\n6. `(` - Opening parenthesis\n7. `)` - Closing parenthesis (matches the sixth character)\n8. `>` - Closing angle bracket (matches the fifth character)\n9. `}` - Closing curly brace (matches the fourth character)\n10. `[` - Opening square bracket\n11. `]` - Closing square bracket (matches the tenth character)\n12. `(` - Opening parenthesis\n13. `{` - Opening curly brace\n14. `}` - Closing curly brace (matches the thirteenth character)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `<` needs a `>`.\n- The twelfth `(` needs a `)`.\n\nSo, the completed sequence should be:\n\n`< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { } ) >`\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\nsequence = \"< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { } ) >\"\nprint(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a stack data structure, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the top of the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, it indicates an imbalance.\n5. After processing all characters, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n6. Construct the completed sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Initialize a stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If it doesn't match, the sequence is already invalid\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        # Append the corresponding closing bracket for each remaining opening bracket\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { }\"\n\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to efficiently manage and match the opening and closing brackets, ensuring that all brackets are properly closed in the correct order. The final output is formatted as requested."
