    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses so that all of them are properly closed. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, angle brackets `< >`, parentheses `( )`, and curly braces `{ }`.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Brackets**: We have four types of brackets, each with an opening and a closing counterpart.\n   - Square brackets: `[ ]`\n   - Angle brackets: `< >`\n   - Parentheses: `( )`\n   - Curly braces: `{ }`\n\n2. **Track the Open Brackets**: As we iterate through the sequence, we'll keep track of the open brackets using a stack data structure. This will help us ensure that each opening bracket is properly closed in the correct order.\n\n3. **Process the Input**: For each character in the input:\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid (though the problem assumes a valid sequence).\n\n4. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input, any remaining open brackets in the stack need to be closed. We'll append the corresponding closing brackets to the sequence.\n\n5. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Finally, we'll print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs of brackets\n    matching_brackets = {\n        '[': ']',\n        '<': '>',\n        '(': ')',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of open brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by closing remaining open brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence + ''.join(matching_brackets[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ [ < [ ( [ < [ ] > ] ) ] > ] ( { }\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",

    "The current solution correctly implements a stack-based approach to ensure that all brackets are properly closed. The code effectively tracks open brackets and appends the necessary closing brackets. Since the output is correct and the complexity analysis indicates a suitable approach, you can proceed with this solution."
