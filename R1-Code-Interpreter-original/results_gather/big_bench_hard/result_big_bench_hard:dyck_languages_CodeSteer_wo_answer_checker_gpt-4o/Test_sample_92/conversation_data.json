    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, and the sequence is balanced. The input sequence is:\n\n\\[ [ < [ ] > ] ] <\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The sequence starts with an opening square bracket `[`.\n2. Inside it, there's an opening angle bracket `<`.\n3. Inside the angle bracket, there's another opening square bracket `[`.\n4. This is followed by a closing square bracket `]`, which balances the last opened square bracket.\n5. Then, there's a closing angle bracket `>`, which balances the angle bracket opened in step 2.\n6. Finally, there's a closing square bracket `]`, which balances the first square bracket opened in step 1.\n\nAfter this, we have an additional opening angle bracket `<` that needs to be closed.\n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to add a closing angle bracket `>` at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence should be:\n\n\\[ [ < [ ] > ] ] < >\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\nsequence = \"[ [ < [ ] > ] ] < >\"\nprint(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a stack data structure, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket (`[`, `<`), push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket (`]`, `>`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack. If not, the sequence is unbalanced.\n5. After processing all characters, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets. Add the corresponding closing brackets to balance the sequence.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    opening_brackets = {'[': ']', '<': '>'}\n    closing_brackets = {']': '[', '>': '<'}\n    \n    # Process each character in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in opening_brackets:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in closing_brackets:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == closing_brackets[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Unbalanced sequence\n                return \"Unbalanced sequence\"\n    \n    # Add necessary closing brackets to balance the sequence\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        sequence += opening_brackets[open_bracket]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ [ < [ ] > ] ] <\"\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to ensure that all brackets are properly matched and balanced. It processes the input sequence and appends any necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence."
