    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets, ensuring that all types of brackets are properly closed. The sequence contains different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets**: Start from the left and identify all the opening brackets that need to be closed. Keep track of the order in which they appear.\n\n2. **Match and Close Brackets**: For each opening bracket, find the corresponding closing bracket. The last opened bracket should be the first to be closed, following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, similar to a stack data structure.\n\n3. **Construct the Completed Sequence**: Append the necessary closing brackets to the sequence to ensure all brackets are properly closed.\n\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Dictionary to match opening and closing brackets\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Construct the closing sequence\n    closing_sequence = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + closing_sequence\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ]\"\n# Complete the sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed, formatted as requested."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
