    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The sequence provided is a mix of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, square brackets `[]`, and parentheses `()`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. This will help us determine which closing bracket is needed next.\n2. **Iterate through the Sequence**: For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`{`, `<`, `[`, or `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`}`, `>`, `]`, or `)`), pop the stack to check if it matches the expected closing bracket. If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid.\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets. Add these to the sequence in the correct order.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'{': '}', '<': '>', '[': ']', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"  # Mismatched or unbalanced\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ < { { [ ] } } { < [ { { < > } } [ ( ) ( ) ] [ [ [ [ ( { < ( < ( [ ] ) > ) > } ) ] ] ] ] ] ( ) ( [ ] { } ) > } > [ { ( ( ) ) } ]\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the completed sequence\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed, wrapped in the format `<<<answer>>>`."
