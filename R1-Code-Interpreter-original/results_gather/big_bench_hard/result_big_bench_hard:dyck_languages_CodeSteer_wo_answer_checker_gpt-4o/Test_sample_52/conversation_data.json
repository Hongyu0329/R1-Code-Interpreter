    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets such that all parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is `< < ( < >`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Count the Opening and Closing Brackets:**\n   - Count the number of each type of opening bracket: `<` and `(`.\n   - Count the number of each type of closing bracket: `>` and `)`.\n\n2. **Determine the Missing Closing Brackets:**\n   - For each type of bracket, determine how many closing brackets are needed to balance the opening brackets.\n\n3. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - Append the necessary closing brackets to the input sequence to ensure all brackets are properly closed.\n\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence:**\n   - Format the output as `<<<completed_sequence>>>`.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Count the opening and closing brackets\n    open_angle = sequence.count('<')\n    close_angle = sequence.count('>')\n    open_paren = sequence.count('(')\n    close_paren = sequence.count(')')\n\n    # Determine the missing closing brackets\n    missing_close_angle = open_angle - close_angle\n    missing_close_paren = open_paren - close_paren\n\n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + '>' * missing_close_angle + ')' * missing_close_paren\n\n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< < ( < >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
    "To solve this problem using a stack data structure, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack:**\n   - Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets that need to be closed.\n\n2. **Process Each Character:**\n   - Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n   - If the character is an opening bracket (`<` or `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket (`>` or `)`), check the stack:\n     - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket, pop the stack.\n     - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match, it indicates an imbalance.\n\n3. **Determine Missing Closing Brackets:**\n   - After processing all characters, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - Append the necessary closing brackets to the input sequence to ensure all brackets are properly closed.\n\n5. **Output the Completed Sequence:**\n   - Format the output as `<<<completed_sequence>>>`.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '<(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == '>':\n            if stack and stack[-1] == '<':\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            if stack and stack[-1] == '(':\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                stack.append(char)\n\n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        top = stack.pop()\n        if top == '<':\n            completed_sequence += '>'\n        elif top == '(':\n            completed_sequence += ')'\n\n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< < ( < >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket is properly matched with a closing bracket in the correct order, and it outputs the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."

    "Solve this question with more complex and delicate code. Consider using a stack data structure to manage the opening and closing of brackets, which will allow for more efficient and accurate balancing of the sequence. This approach will help ensure that each opening bracket is properly matched with a closing bracket in the correct order."
