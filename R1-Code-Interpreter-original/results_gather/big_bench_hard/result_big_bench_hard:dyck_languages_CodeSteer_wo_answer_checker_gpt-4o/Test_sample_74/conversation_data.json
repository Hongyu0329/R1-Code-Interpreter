    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and balanced. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, angle brackets `<>`, and parentheses `()`. Our task is to complete the sequence by closing any open brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. This will help us ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Sequence**: Go through each character in the sequence. If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it matches, pop the stack. If it doesn't match, the sequence is already incorrect.\n\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing all characters, if there are any remaining opening brackets in the stack, append the corresponding closing brackets to the sequence to complete it.\n\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'{': '}', '[': ']', '(': ')', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"  # Mismatched or unbalanced\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_pairs[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ < [ < ( < [ ] > ) < > < { } > { < > { } { { < [ < < { } [ { } ] < > > > ] < > > } < [ [ ] ] > } } > ] [ ( ) ] > } [ { ( < ( ( ( [ { } ] ) ) ) > ) } ] [ < ( ) ( ( { ( ) [ { { ( { } ) } } ] } ) ) >\"\n\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will process the input sequence, complete it by adding the necessary closing brackets, and print the result in the required format."
