    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets so that all types of brackets are properly closed. The input sequence is `{ ( < [ < > ]`. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{` - This is an opening curly brace. We need a closing curly brace `}`.\n2. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis. We need a closing parenthesis `)`.\n3. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket. We need a closing angle bracket `>`.\n4. `[` - This is an opening square bracket. We need a closing square bracket `]`.\n5. `< >` - This pair of angle brackets is already closed.\n6. `]` - This is a closing square bracket, which matches the opening square bracket at position 4.\n\nNow, let's determine the sequence of closing brackets needed to properly close all the opened brackets:\n\n- After the `]`, we need to close the `(` with `)`.\n- Then, we need to close the `{` with `}`.\n\nThe final sequence of closing brackets should be `)>}`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence of closing brackets needed\nclosing_sequence = \")>}\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{closing_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To implement a more robust solution, we can use a stack data structure to parse the input sequence. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets, and we will pop from the stack when we encounter a matching closing bracket. This approach ensures that all types of brackets are properly matched and closed, even in nested and complex structures.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Define a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.\n3. Iterate through each character in the input sequence:\n   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n4. After processing the input, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need to be closed. Generate the sequence of closing brackets needed to close all remaining brackets in the stack.\n5. Output the final sequence of closing brackets in the required format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_brackets(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs of brackets\n    matching_brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[', '>': '<'}\n    opening_brackets = set(matching_brackets.values())\n    \n    # Initialize an empty stack\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in opening_brackets:\n            # Push opening brackets onto the stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets:\n            # Check if the stack is not empty and the top matches\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_brackets[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Generate the sequence of closing brackets needed\n    closing_sequence = ''\n    while stack:\n        opening_bracket = stack.pop()\n        # Find the corresponding closing bracket\n        for closing, opening in matching_brackets.items():\n            if opening == opening_bracket:\n                closing_sequence += closing\n                break\n    \n    # Output the final answer in the required format\n    return f\"<<<{closing_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ ( < [ < > ]\"\n\n# Get the final answer\nfinal_answer = complete_brackets(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(final_answer)\n```"

    "To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex approach that involves parsing the input sequence and using a stack data structure to ensure that all types of brackets are properly matched and closed. This will allow for a more dynamic and robust solution that can handle various input sequences. Try to incorporate symbolic computing techniques to enhance the code's capability in handling nested and complex bracket structures."
