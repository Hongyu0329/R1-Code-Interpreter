    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses and angle brackets such that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols, and they are properly nested. The input sequence is `( ( < >`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Count the number of each type of opening and closing symbols.\n2. Determine how many of each type of closing symbol is needed to balance the sequence.\n3. Append the necessary closing symbols to the sequence in the correct order to ensure proper nesting.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- We have two opening parentheses `(` and one opening angle bracket `<`.\n- We have one closing angle bracket `>`.\n- We need to add one closing parenthesis `)` for each opening parenthesis `(`.\n- The sequence should be completed as `( ( < > ) )`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"( ( < >\"\n\n# Count the number of opening and closing symbols\nopen_paren = sequence.count('(')\nclose_paren = sequence.count(')')\nopen_angle = sequence.count('<')\nclose_angle = sequence.count('>')\n\n# Calculate the number of closing symbols needed\nneeded_close_paren = open_paren - close_paren\nneeded_close_angle = open_angle - close_angle\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_close_paren\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the correct format."
