    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: round `()`, square `[]`, curly `{}`, and angle `<>`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Traverse the input sequence character by character.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid (though the problem assumes the input is valid up to the point given).\n5. After processing the input, the stack will contain unmatched opening brackets.\n6. Pop each unmatched opening bracket from the stack and append the corresponding closing bracket to the result.\n7. Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>'\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return completed_sequence\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( ( < { [ [ { [ [ ( [ < < > > ( ( [ ( ) ( { ( < [ ] > ) } ) ] ) ) ] ) ] ( ) ] } { [ [ ] ] } ] ] } > [ { < > } ]\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
