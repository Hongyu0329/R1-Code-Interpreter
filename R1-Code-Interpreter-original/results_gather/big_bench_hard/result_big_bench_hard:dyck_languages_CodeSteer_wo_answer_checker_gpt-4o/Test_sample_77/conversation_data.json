    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets and parentheses have corresponding closing ones. The sequence given is:\n\n```\n< < [ ] > ( < > ) <\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<`: Open angle bracket\n2. `<`: Open angle bracket\n3. `[`: Open square bracket\n4. `]`: Close square bracket (matches the previous `[`)\n5. `>`: Close angle bracket (matches the second `<`)\n6. `(`: Open parenthesis\n7. `<`: Open angle bracket\n8. `>`: Close angle bracket (matches the previous `<`)\n9. `)`: Close parenthesis (matches the previous `(`)\n10. `<`: Open angle bracket\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `<` is still open.\n- The last `<` is still open.\n\nTo close these, we need two `>` at the end.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n```\n< < [ ] > ( < > ) < >\n```\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\nsequence = \"< < [ ] > ( < > ) < >\"\nprint(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To ensure the sequence is correctly balanced and formatted, we can use a stack to track the opening brackets and parentheses. This approach will help us verify that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Once we have a balanced sequence, we can format the output as required.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket (`<`, `[`, `(`), push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket (`>`, `]`, `)`), check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match, the sequence is unbalanced (though this shouldn't happen with the given input).\n5. After processing the sequence, any remaining items in the stack need corresponding closing brackets.\n6. Append the necessary closing brackets to balance the sequence.\n7. Format the output as `<<<completed_sequence>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    completed_sequence = []\n\n    # Mapping of opening to closing brackets\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '(': ')'}\n\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n            completed_sequence.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            completed_sequence.append(char)\n        else:\n            completed_sequence.append(char)\n\n    # Add the necessary closing brackets for any remaining open brackets\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence.append(matching_bracket[stack.pop()])\n\n    return ''.join(completed_sequence)\n\nsequence = \"< < [ ] > ( < > ) <\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(sequence)\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that the sequence is balanced and formatted correctly.",

    "Let's debug the logic by printing the state of the stack at each step to ensure that we are correctly matching and closing the brackets.

    "To address the issue with extra closing brackets and ensure that spaces do not interfere with the bracket matching process, we need to refine the logic.
