    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, and angle brackets `<>`. We need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. If the character is an opening bracket (`{`, `[`, `<`, or `(`), push it onto the stack.\n4. If the character is a closing bracket (`}`, `]`, `>`, or `)`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack. If not, the sequence is invalid.\n5. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the sequence is valid and all brackets are properly closed. If not, the sequence is incomplete, and we need to add the necessary closing brackets to complete it.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'{': '}', '[': ']', '<': '>', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # If stack is not empty, add the necessary closing brackets\n    completion = ''.join(matching_pairs[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    print(f\"<<<{sequence + completion}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ [ < [ < { < { } > } > ( ( < { [ ] } > { { } } ) { } ) ] > ]\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
