    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, curly braces, and angle brackets are properly closed. The sequence given is:\n\n```\n( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) >\n```\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing pairs**: \n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Curly braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n2. **Track the sequence**: \n   - Start with an empty stack to keep track of the opening symbols.\n   - Traverse the sequence from left to right.\n   - For each opening symbol, push it onto the stack.\n   - For each closing symbol, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid (but we assume the input is valid up to the point given).\n\n3. **Complete the sequence**:\n   - After processing the input, any remaining symbols in the stack need to be closed in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening symbols\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening symbol\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing symbol\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by closing remaining symbols in the stack\n    completion = ''.join(matching_pairs[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    final_answer = sequence + completion\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n# Given input\ninput_sequence = \"( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all parentheses, curly braces, and angle brackets properly closed.",
    "To ensure that all opening symbols are properly closed, we need to carefully track each type of symbol and ensure that they are closed in the correct order.
