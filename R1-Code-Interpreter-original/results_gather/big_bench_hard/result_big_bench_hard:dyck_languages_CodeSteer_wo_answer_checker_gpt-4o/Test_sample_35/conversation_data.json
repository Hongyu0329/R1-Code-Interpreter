    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is balanced and properly closed. The sequence includes different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, parentheses `( )`, and angle brackets `< >`. \n\nThe task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through the sequence:\n   - If an opening bracket is encountered, push it onto the stack.\n   - If a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is already invalid.\n3. After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n4. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input sequence.\n5. Output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If the sequence is invalid, return an error message\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ { ( { } ) } < < ( ) { { < [ { [ ( ) ] } ] > } } > >\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
