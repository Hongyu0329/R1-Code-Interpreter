    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets so that all types of brackets are properly closed. The sequence contains different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets**: Traverse the sequence from left to right and keep track of the opening brackets using a stack data structure. Each time you encounter an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets**: When you encounter a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid, but since the task is to complete the sequence, we assume the input is valid up to the point given.\n\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets. Pop each opening bracket from the stack and append the corresponding closing bracket to the sequence.\n\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
