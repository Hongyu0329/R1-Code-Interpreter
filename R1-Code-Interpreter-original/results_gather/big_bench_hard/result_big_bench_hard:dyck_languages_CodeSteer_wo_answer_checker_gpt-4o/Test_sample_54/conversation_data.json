    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, and angle brackets `<>`. The task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. This will help us ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n2. **Iterate through the Sequence**: For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid.\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing all characters, if there are any remaining opening brackets in the stack, add the corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < { < { } > { { ( [ ( { } ) ( ( [ ( [ ( { [ { } ] } ) ] ) ] ) ) [ < [ [ [ [ [ < > ] [ { [ [ { ( ( < [ ] > ) [ ( [ ] ) ] < { [ ] } > ) } ] ] } ] { < ( < > ) > } ] ] ] ] > ] ] ) } } } >\"\n\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets and print the result in the specified format.",

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.

    "The current solution effectively uses a stack to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The code correctly completes the sequence and outputs it in the specified format. Since the code is correct and the complexity analysis indicates that it uses systematic searching and symbolic computing, no further improvements are necessary. You can proceed with this solution."
