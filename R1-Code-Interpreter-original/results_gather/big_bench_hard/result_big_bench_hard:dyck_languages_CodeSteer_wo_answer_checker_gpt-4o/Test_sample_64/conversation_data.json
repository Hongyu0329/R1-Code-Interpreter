    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > \\]\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. **[**: This is an opening bracket. We need a corresponding closing bracket **]**.\n2. **<**: This is an opening angle bracket. We need a corresponding closing angle bracket **>**.\n3. **(**: This is an opening parenthesis. We need a corresponding closing parenthesis **)**.\n\nThe sequence already contains some closing brackets, but we need to ensure that all opening brackets have matching closing brackets in the correct order. Let's go through the sequence step by step:\n\n- **<**: Open angle bracket\n- **(**: Open parenthesis\n- **<**: Open angle bracket\n- **<**: Open angle bracket\n- **>**: Close angle bracket (matches the last opened angle bracket)\n- **[**: Open square bracket\n- **]**: Close square bracket (matches the last opened square bracket)\n- **(**: Open parenthesis\n- **)**: Close parenthesis (matches the last opened parenthesis)\n- **>**: Close angle bracket (matches the second last opened angle bracket)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- **>**: Close angle bracket (matches the first opened angle bracket)\n- **)**: Close parenthesis (matches the first opened parenthesis)\n- **>**: Close angle bracket (matches the first opened angle bracket)\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > > ) > \\]\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\nsequence = \"<(<<>[]())>>)>\"\nprint(f\"<<<{sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a stack data structure, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid (though the problem assumes a valid sequence).\n5. After processing the input sequence, any remaining items in the stack need to be closed. Pop each item and append the corresponding closing bracket to the result.\n6. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '(': ')', '[': ']'}\n    \n    # Initialize a stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Result list to build the completed sequence\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n            result.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Close any remaining open brackets\n    while stack:\n        result.append(matching_bracket[stack.pop()])\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a string\n    completed_sequence = ''.join(result)\n    \n    # Output the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"<(<<>[]())>\"\n\n# Call the function with the input sequence\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to manage the opening brackets and ensures that each one is properly closed in the correct order. The final sequence is printed in the specified format."

Consider using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and ensure that each one is properly closed in the correct order. This approach will help you manage the nested structure of the brackets and parentheses more effectively."
