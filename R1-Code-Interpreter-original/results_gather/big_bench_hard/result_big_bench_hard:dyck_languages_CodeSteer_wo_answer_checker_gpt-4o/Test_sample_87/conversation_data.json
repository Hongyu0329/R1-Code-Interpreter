    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, angle brackets `< >`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. This will help us ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n2. **Iterate through the Sequence**: For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`[`, `<`, `{`, `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`]`, `>`, `}`, `)`), check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid (though the problem assumes a valid sequence).\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing all characters, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets. Add these to the sequence in the reverse order of their appearance in the stack.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'[': ']', '<': '>', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # This should not happen as per the problem statement\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ [ < < { [ ] ( [ [ ( [ [ { [ ] } ] ] ) ( ) ] ] ) ( ) [ ] < [ ( ( ( ) ) ) ] < < < > [ ( ) ] > [ ] > > [ < > ] } > >\"\n\n# Call the function with the input sequence\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",

    "The current solution effectively uses a stack to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, and it correctly completes the sequence. The code demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and implements a systematic approach to solve it. Since the code is correct and outputs the expected result, no further improvements are necessary. You can proceed with this solution."
