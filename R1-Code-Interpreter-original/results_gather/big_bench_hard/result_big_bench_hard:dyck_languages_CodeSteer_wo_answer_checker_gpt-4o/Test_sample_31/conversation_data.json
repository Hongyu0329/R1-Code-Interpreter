    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The input sequence is \"( < [ (\", which consists of different types of brackets: parentheses '()', angle brackets '<>', and square brackets '[]'.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets**: The input sequence has the following opening brackets: '(', '<', '[', and '('.\n\n2. **Determine the Closing Brackets**: Each type of opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket:\n   - '(' corresponds to ')'\n   - '<' corresponds to '>'\n   - '[' corresponds to ']'\n\n3. **Close the Brackets in Reverse Order**: To properly close the sequence, we need to close the brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n   - The last opened bracket '(' should be closed first with ')'.\n   - The next bracket '[' should be closed with ']'.\n   - The next bracket '<' should be closed with '>'.\n   - Finally, the first opened bracket '(' should be closed with ')'.\n\n4. **Construct the Complete Sequence**: Append the closing brackets to the input sequence in the order determined above.\n\n5. **Output the Complete Sequence**: Format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < [ (\"\n\n# Corresponding closing brackets in reverse order\nclosing_sequence = \") ] > )\"\n\n# Complete sequence\ncomplete_sequence = input_sequence + \" \" + closing_sequence\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{complete_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To improve the solution using a stack data structure, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. This will help us manage nested and complex sequences efficiently.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the Input Sequence**: For each character in the input sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket ('(', '<', or '['), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, pop the top of the stack to ensure it matches the current closing bracket. However, since the input only contains opening brackets, this step is not needed for this specific input.\n\n3. **Generate the Closing Sequence**: After processing the input, the stack will contain all the opening brackets that need to be closed. Pop each element from the stack and append its corresponding closing bracket to the result.\n\n4. **Output the Complete Sequence**: Combine the input sequence with the generated closing sequence and format the output.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < [ (\"\n\n# Mapping of opening to closing brackets\nbracket_pairs = {\n    '(': ')',\n    '<': '>',\n    '[': ']'\n}\n\n# Initialize a stack\nstack = []\n\n# Process the input sequence\nfor char in input_sequence:\n    if char in bracket_pairs:\n        stack.append(char)\n\n# Generate the closing sequence\nclosing_sequence = \"\"\nwhile stack:\n    opening_bracket = stack.pop()\n    closing_sequence += bracket_pairs[opening_bracket] + \" \"\n\n# Complete sequence\ncomplete_sequence = input_sequence + \" \" + closing_sequence.strip()\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{complete_sequence}>>>\")\n```"

    "The current solution correctly identifies the need to close the brackets in reverse order and constructs the complete sequence. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code could be improved by incorporating more symbolic computing techniques. Consider using a stack data structure to manage the opening and closing of brackets, which can provide a more robust and scalable solution. This approach will also help in efficiently handling more complex sequences with nested brackets. Try to implement this using a stack to ensure that the solution is both correct and optimized."
