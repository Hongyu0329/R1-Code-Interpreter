    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is balanced and properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, angle brackets `<>`, and square brackets `[]`. Our task is to complete the sequence so that all brackets are properly closed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through the sequence:\n   - If an opening bracket is encountered, push it onto the stack.\n   - If a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is already invalid.\n3. After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n4. Construct the sequence of closing brackets needed to balance the sequence.\n5. Output the completed sequence.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'{': '}', '(': ')', '<': '>', '[': ']'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Construct the closing sequence needed to balance\n    closing_sequence = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + closing_sequence\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ ( < > ) } ( ( [ ] ) < [ ( [ [ ] ] [ { } ] { } [ < { [ ] } > ] ( ) ) ]\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the format `<<<answer>>>`."

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
