    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is `{ < <`. This sequence consists of one curly brace `{` and two angle brackets `< <`. \n\nThe task is to close each of these brackets in the correct order. The correct closing sequence for these brackets is `> > }`. This is because:\n- The first `<` should be closed with a `>`.\n- The second `<` should be closed with another `>`.\n- Finally, the `{` should be closed with a `}`.\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence is `{ < < > > }`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ < <\"\n\n# Define the closing sequence\nclosing_sequence = \"> > }\"\n\n# Combine the input and closing sequences\ncomplete_sequence = input_sequence + \" \" + closing_sequence\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{complete_sequence}>>>\")\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
