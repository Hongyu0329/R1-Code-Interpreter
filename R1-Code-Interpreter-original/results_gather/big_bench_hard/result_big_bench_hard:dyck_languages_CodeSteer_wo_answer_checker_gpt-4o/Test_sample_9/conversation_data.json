    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets, ensuring that all types of brackets are properly closed. The sequence contains different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, parentheses `( )`, curly braces `{ }`, and angle brackets `< >`.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input sequence from left to right.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`[`, `(`, `{`, `<`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`]`, `)`, `}`, `>`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n4. After processing the input sequence, the stack will contain the unmatched opening brackets.\n5. To complete the sequence, append the corresponding closing brackets for each unmatched opening bracket in the stack.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {']': '[', ')': '(', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    opening_bracket = {'[', '(', '{', '<'}\n    closing_bracket = {']', ')', '}', '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in opening_bracket:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in closing_bracket:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the corresponding closing brackets\n    completion = []\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        for close, open in matching_bracket.items():\n            if open == open_bracket:\n                completion.append(close)\n                break\n    \n    # Join the completion to form the final answer\n    final_answer = ''.join(completion)\n    return f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ ] ( [ [ { < { { ( < > [ ] ) } } < > > } ] ] { }\"\n# Remove spaces for processing\ninput_sequence = input_sequence.replace(\" \", \"\")\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the format `<<<answer>>>`.",

If so, pop the stack. If not, the sequence is invalid, but since we are completing it, we ignore this case.\n4. After processing the input sequence, the stack will contain the unmatched opening brackets.\n5. To complete the sequence, append the corresponding closing brackets for each unmatched opening bracket in the stack in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this refined approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'[': ']', '(': ')', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the corresponding closing brackets\n    completion = []\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        completion.append(matching_bracket[open_bracket])\n    \n    # Join the completion to form the final answer\n    final_answer = ''.join(completion)\n    return f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ ] ( [ [ { < { { ( < > [ ] ) } } < > > } ] ] { }\"\n# Remove spaces for processing\ninput_sequence = input_sequence.replace(\" \", \"\")\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly complete the sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to match all opening brackets.
