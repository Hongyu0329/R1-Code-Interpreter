    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and balanced. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: round `()`, square `[]`, curly `{}`, and angle `<>`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Traverse the input sequence character by character.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is already invalid.\n5. After processing all characters, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets. We need to add the corresponding closing brackets to balance the sequence.\n6. Output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Invalid sequence, but we assume input is valid up to this point\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_pairs[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( [ [ { < > { } { } < < < < { } > > ( < ( ( ) ) [ ( [ ] ) ] > ) > > { } } [ < < > > ] < ( ) > ] ]\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\nresult = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed and balanced."
