    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The input sequence is: `( < > ( [ ( )`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets**: We have the following opening brackets in the sequence: `(`, `<`, `(`, `[`, `(`.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets**: We have the following closing brackets in the sequence: `>`, `)`.\n\n3. **Match the Brackets**: We need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket in the correct order:\n   - The first `(` should be closed with `)`.\n   - The `<` should be closed with `>`.\n   - The second `(` should be closed with `)`.\n   - The `[` should be closed with `]`.\n   - The third `(` should be closed with `)`.\n\n4. **Complete the Sequence**: Add the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"( < > ( [ ( )\"\n\n# Add the necessary closing brackets\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" ] ) )\"\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
    "To solve the problem using a stack-based approach, we can utilize a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. This method is efficient and commonly used for problems involving matching parentheses or brackets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a list to simulate a stack for storing opening brackets.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Sequence**: Go through each character in the input sequence.\n   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `<`, `[`, `{`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `>`, `]`, `}`), pop the top element from the stack (if the stack is not empty) to match it with the current closing bracket.\n\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need to be closed. Pop each element from the stack and append the corresponding closing bracket to the sequence.\n\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the final sequence with all brackets properly closed.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_brackets(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs for brackets\n    matching_bracket = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '<': '>',\n        '[': ']',\n        '{': '}'\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize a stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Result list to build the completed sequence\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n            result.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Close any remaining opening brackets in the stack\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        result.append(matching_bracket[open_bracket])\n    \n    # Join the result list into a string\n    completed_sequence = ' '.join(result)\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < > ( [ ( )\"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncomplete_brackets(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to manage the opening and closing of brackets, ensuring that all brackets are properly matched and closed. The final sequence is printed in the required format."

    "The current solution is correct in terms of closing the brackets properly, but the complexity analysis indicates that the code is not utilizing symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the code, consider implementing a stack-based approach to dynamically match and close the brackets. This will not only ensure correctness but also demonstrate a more sophisticated method of solving the problem. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, using data structures like stacks to manage the opening and closing of brackets."
