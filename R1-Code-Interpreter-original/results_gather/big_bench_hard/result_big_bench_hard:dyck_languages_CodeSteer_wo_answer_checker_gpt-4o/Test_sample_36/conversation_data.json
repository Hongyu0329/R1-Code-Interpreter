    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all opening parentheses, curly braces, and brackets have corresponding closing ones. The input sequence is `( ( { }`. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Count the number of each type of opening and closing symbols.\n2. For each type of symbol, ensure that the number of opening symbols matches the number of closing symbols.\n3. Add the necessary closing symbols to balance the sequence.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- We have two opening parentheses `(` and one opening curly brace `{`.\n- We have one closing curly brace `}`.\n- We need to add one closing parenthesis `)` for each opening parenthesis `(`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to complete the sequence and output the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"( ( { }\"\n\n# Count the number of opening and closing symbols\nopen_parentheses = sequence.count('(')\nclose_parentheses = sequence.count(')')\nopen_curly_braces = sequence.count('{')\nclose_curly_braces = sequence.count('}')\n\n# Calculate the number of closing symbols needed\nneeded_close_parentheses = open_parentheses - close_parentheses\nneeded_close_curly_braces = open_curly_braces - close_curly_braces\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_close_parentheses + '}' * needed_close_curly_braces\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the necessary closing symbols."
