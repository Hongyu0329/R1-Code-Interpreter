    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is balanced and properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, and square brackets `[]`. Our task is to complete the sequence so that all opened brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Traverse the input sequence character by character.\n3. For each opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the top of the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match, the sequence is already incorrect, but since we are completing it, we will ignore this case.\n5. After processing the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need to be closed. We will append the corresponding closing brackets to the sequence.\n6. Output the completed sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {\n        '(': ')',\n        '{': '}',\n        '<': '>',\n        '[': ']'\n    }\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                # If it doesn't match, we ignore since we are completing\n                continue\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( ( { < > ( ) [ { < ( < > < ( ( ) ( [ { } ] ) ) > { { } { ( ) } } ) [ ] > } ] { { } } }\"\n# Output the completed sequence\nprint(complete_sequence(input_sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
