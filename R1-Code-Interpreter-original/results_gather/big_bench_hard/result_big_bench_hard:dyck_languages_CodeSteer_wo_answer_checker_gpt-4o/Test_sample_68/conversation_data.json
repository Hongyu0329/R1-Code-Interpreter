    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses and brackets such that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The input sequence is \"( [ ( )\", which means we have:\n\n1. An opening parenthesis '('\n2. An opening bracket '['\n3. An opening parenthesis '('\n4. A closing parenthesis ')'\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to close the remaining open symbols in the reverse order of their opening. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. The last opened symbol is '[', so we need to close it with ']'.\n2. The first opened symbol is '(', so we need to close it with ')'.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be \"( [ ( ) ] )\".\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output this completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Define the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = \"( [ ( ) ] )\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To handle any sequence of parentheses and brackets dynamically, we can use a stack-based approach. This approach is efficient for matching and closing symbols because it follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which is ideal for handling nested structures like parentheses and brackets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening symbols.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening symbol ('(', '['), push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing symbol (')', ']'), pop the top of the stack to ensure it matches the current closing symbol.\n5. After processing the input, any remaining symbols in the stack need to be closed in reverse order of their opening.\n6. Construct the completed sequence by appending the necessary closing symbols.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '['}\n    opening_symbols = set(matching_pairs.values())\n    \n    # Initialize a stack to track opening symbols\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in opening_symbols:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_pairs[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If there's a mismatch, the input is invalid\n                return \"Invalid input sequence\"\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        open_symbol = stack.pop()\n        if open_symbol == '(':\n            completed_sequence += ')'\n        elif open_symbol == '[':\n            completed_sequence += ']'\n    \n    return completed_sequence\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( [ ( )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will dynamically handle any sequence of parentheses and brackets, ensuring that all symbols are properly matched and closed."

    "The current solution correctly completes the sequence of parentheses and brackets. However, to enhance the complexity and robustness of the solution, consider implementing a stack-based approach to dynamically handle any sequence of parentheses and brackets. This will allow the solution to adapt to different inputs and ensure that all symbols are properly matched and closed. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, utilizing data structures like stacks for efficient symbol matching and closing."
