    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and angle brackets `<>`. \n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the input string and use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. For each character in the string:\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is invalid.\n3. After processing the input, the stack should be empty if all brackets are properly closed.\n4. If the stack is not empty, the remaining elements in the stack need to be closed with the corresponding closing brackets.\n5. Construct the final sequence by appending the necessary closing brackets to the input.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'{': '}', '(': ')', '[': ']', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Construct the final sequence by adding necessary closing brackets\n    final_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        final_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return f\"<<<{final_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ { ( { [ [ { < [ ] > } ] ] } ) [ ( < { < > } > ) ]\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
