    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets so that all types of brackets are properly closed. The input sequence is `{ { } ( ( < > )`. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{ { }`: The first two curly braces are opened, and one is closed. We need to close the remaining open curly brace.\n2. `( ( < > )`: Two parentheses are opened, and one is closed. We need to close the remaining open parenthesis.\n3. `< >`: The angle brackets are already properly closed.\n\nThe task is to add the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence. Here's the plan:\n\n- Add a closing curly brace `}` to close the remaining open curly brace.\n- Add a closing parenthesis `)` to close the remaining open parenthesis.\n\nThe final sequence should be `{ { } ( ( < > ) } )`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"{ { } ( ( < > )\"\n\n# Add the necessary closing brackets\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" } )\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
