    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is `< [ < > ]`. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `[` - This is an opening square bracket.\n3. `<` - This is another opening angle bracket.\n4. `>` - This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the last opened angle bracket.\n5. `]` - This is a closing square bracket, which matches the last opened square bracket.\n\nNow, we need to close the first opening angle bracket `<` that hasn't been closed yet. Therefore, we need to add a `>` at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe completed sequence should be `< [ < > ] >`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ < > ]\"\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding the missing closing bracket\ncompleted_sequence = input_sequence + \" >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",

Parse the input sequence to identify unmatched opening brackets.\n2. Add the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n3. Format the output as `<<<completed_sequence>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ < > ]\"\n\n# Initialize a stack to track unmatched opening brackets\nstack = []\n\n# Define matching pairs for brackets\nmatching_brackets = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')' }\n\n# Iterate over each character in the input sequence\nfor char in input_sequence:\n    if char in matching_brackets:\n        # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n        stack.append(char)\n    elif char in matching_brackets.values():\n        # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack if it matches\n        if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n            stack.pop()\n\n# Add the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = input_sequence + ''.join(matching_brackets[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to track unmatched opening brackets and adds the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence.
