    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: round `()`, square `[]`, curly `{}`, and angle `<>`. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and they must be properly nested.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Traverse the sequence from left to right.\n2. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n3. For each character in the sequence:\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack. If not, the sequence is invalid.\n4. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the sequence is valid and complete. If not, the sequence is incomplete, and we need to add the necessary closing brackets to complete it.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # If stack is not empty, add the necessary closing brackets\n    completion = ''.join(matching_pairs[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    print(f\"<<<{sequence}{completion}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( ( { < { < { < > } > } > } ) ( ) ( { [ ( < ( < < { ( { < > } ) } > > ) > ) { ( { < ( { [ ] } ( ) ) > } < { < { { ( ) } } > { < [ { ( ) } ] > } } > ) } [ [ ( ) ] ] ]\"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the format `<<<answer>>>`."
