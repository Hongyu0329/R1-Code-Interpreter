    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: `()`, `[]`, and `{}`. We need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`), push it onto the stack.\n4. If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the stack.\n5. If the stack is empty after processing the input, the sequence is already complete. If not, the remaining items in the stack need to be closed.\n6. Construct the closing sequence by popping from the stack and appending the corresponding closing brackets.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If there's a mismatch, the input is invalid\n                return \"Invalid input sequence\"\n    \n    # Construct the closing sequence\n    closing_sequence = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    print(f\"<<<{input_sequence}{closing_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"(< < > ( [ < { { } } ( ) > ] ) [ ( ) ] [ ] [ { } ] >\"\n\n# Call the function\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with properly closed brackets.",
