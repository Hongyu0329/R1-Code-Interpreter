    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets such that all the parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is `{ ( [ ] )`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Open Brackets**: We have three types of brackets: curly `{}`, round `()`, and square `[]`. In the input, we have an opening curly brace `{`, an opening round bracket `(`, and an opening square bracket `[`. \n\n2. **Identify the Closed Brackets**: We have a closing square bracket `]` and a closing round bracket `)` in the input.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Closing Brackets**: \n   - The opening curly brace `{` is not closed.\n   - The opening round bracket `(` is closed by `)`.\n   - The opening square bracket `[` is closed by `]`.\n\n4. **Complete the Sequence**: We need to add a closing curly brace `}` to complete the sequence.\n\n5. **Output the Completed Sequence**: The completed sequence should be `{ ( [ ] ) }`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"{ ( [ ] )\"\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding the missing closing curly brace\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" }\"\n\n# Output the completed sequence in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"
