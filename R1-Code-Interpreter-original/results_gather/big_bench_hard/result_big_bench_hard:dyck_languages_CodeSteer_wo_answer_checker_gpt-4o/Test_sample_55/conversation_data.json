    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses and angle brackets such that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols. The input sequence is \"( < < < >\", which consists of one parenthesis and three angle brackets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Count the number of opening and closing parentheses.\n2. Count the number of opening and closing angle brackets.\n3. Determine how many closing symbols are needed to balance the sequence.\n4. Append the necessary closing symbols to the sequence.\n5. Output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Count the number of opening and closing symbols\n    open_paren = sequence.count('(')\n    close_paren = sequence.count(')')\n    open_angle = sequence.count('<')\n    close_angle = sequence.count('>')\n\n    # Calculate the number of closing symbols needed\n    needed_close_paren = open_paren - close_paren\n    needed_close_angle = open_angle - close_angle\n\n    # Append the necessary closing symbols\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_close_paren + '>' * needed_close_angle\n\n    # Output the completed sequence in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < < < >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with the correct number of closing symbols, ensuring that all parentheses and angle brackets are properly closed.",
    "Let's re-evaluate the logic for appending the necessary closing symbols to ensure the output format strictly follows the requirement. We need to ensure that the output only includes the necessary closing symbols without any additional characters.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n1. Count the number of opening and closing parentheses.\n2. Count the number of opening and closing angle brackets.\n3. Determine how many closing symbols are needed to balance the sequence.\n4.

    "To ensure that each opening symbol is correctly matched with a closing symbol, we can use a stack-based approach. This method will help manage nested structures and ensure proper closure. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening symbols.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening symbol ('(' or '<'), push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing symbol (')' or '>'), pop the corresponding opening symbol from the stack if the stack is not empty.\n5. After processing the input sequence, the stack will contain unmatched opening symbols.\n6. Append the necessary closing symbols to balance the sequence based on the remaining items in the stack.\n7. Output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '(<':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')' and stack and stack[-1] == '(':\n            stack.pop()\n        elif char == '>' and stack and stack[-1] == '<':\n            stack.pop()\n\n    # Append the necessary closing symbols\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        opening = stack.pop()\n        if opening == '(':\n            completed_sequence += ')'\n        elif opening == '<':\n            completed_sequence += '>'\n\n    # Output the completed sequence in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < < < >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code uses a stack to ensure that each opening symbol is correctly matched with a closing symbol, and it outputs the completed sequence in the specified format.",
    "To refine the solution and ensure that the output accurately reflects the input sequence's structure, we need to carefully manage the stack operations and the conditions for appending closing symbols. Let's address the potential issues:\n\n1. Ensure that we only pop from the stack when there is a matching opening symbol.\n2. Append the necessary closing symbols only for unmatched opening symbols left in the stack.\n3. Handle edge cases where the sequence might have unmatched symbols or incorrect ordering.\n\nHere's the revised implementation:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '(<':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')' and stack and stack[-1] == '(':\n            stack.pop()\n        elif char == '>' and stack and stack[-1] == '<':\n            stack.pop()\n\n    # Append the necessary closing symbols\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    for opening in reversed(stack):\n        if opening == '(':\n            completed_sequence += ')'\n        elif opening == '<':\n            completed_sequence += '>'\n\n    # Output the completed sequence in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < < < >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code ensures that each opening symbol is correctly matched with a closing symbol, and it appends only the necessary closing symbols for unmatched opening symbols.
