    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses so that they are balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is \"( < >\", which includes different types of brackets: round brackets `()`, angle brackets `<>`, and a closing angle bracket `>`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Count the number of opening and closing brackets for each type.\n2. Determine how many of each type of closing bracket is needed to balance the sequence.\n3. Append the necessary closing brackets to the sequence to make it balanced.\n4. Output the completed sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Initialize counters for each type of bracket\n    open_round = 0\n    close_round = 0\n    open_angle = 0\n    close_angle = 0\n\n    # Count the brackets in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char == '(':\n            open_round += 1\n        elif char == ')':\n            close_round += 1\n        elif char == '<':\n            open_angle += 1\n        elif char == '>':\n            close_angle += 1\n\n    # Calculate the number of closing brackets needed\n    needed_close_round = open_round - close_round\n    needed_close_angle = open_angle - close_angle\n\n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = sequence + ')' * needed_close_round + '>' * needed_close_angle\n\n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < >\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will count the opening and closing brackets, determine how many are needed to balance the sequence, and then output the completed sequence in the specified format."
