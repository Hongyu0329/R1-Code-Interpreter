    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is:\n\n```\n[ < > ] [ [ < > ]\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first part `[ < > ]` is already complete and balanced.\n2. The second part `[ [ < > ]` is missing a closing bracket for the outermost `[`. \n\nTo balance the sequence, we need to add a closing bracket `]` at the end of the sequence. \n\nThe completed sequence will be:\n\n```\n[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python code to output the completed sequence in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"[ < > ] [ [ < > ]\"\n\n# Complete the sequence by adding the missing closing bracket\ncompleted_sequence = input_sequence + \" ]\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
