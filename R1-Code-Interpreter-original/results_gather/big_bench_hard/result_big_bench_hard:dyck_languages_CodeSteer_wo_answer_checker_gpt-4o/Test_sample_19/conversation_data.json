    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the brackets and parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence contains different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. Our task is to complete the sequence by closing any unclosed brackets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify Unclosed Brackets**: Traverse the input sequence and keep track of the opening brackets that have not been closed yet. Use a stack data structure to help with this, as it allows us to easily match the most recent opening bracket with a closing bracket.\n\n2. **Match Brackets**: As we traverse the sequence, whenever we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the most recent opening bracket (the top of the stack). If it matches, we pop the stack. If it doesn't match, the sequence is invalid, but since the task is to complete the sequence, we assume the input is valid up to the point given.\n\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need to be closed. We will append the corresponding closing brackets to the sequence.\n\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Finally, we output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs for brackets\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of unclosed opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Traverse the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Properly closed, pop from stack\n            else:\n                # In a real scenario, we might handle mismatched brackets, but here we assume input is valid\n                pass\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by closing remaining unclosed brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Given input\ninput_sequence = \"[ < < > > < ( < < < [ [ [ [ ] ] ] ] > > > ) [ < < [ ] > > ] { [ < > ] < > [ ( ) ] } { [ ]\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed."
