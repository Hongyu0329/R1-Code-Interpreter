    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is `< < { } >`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the input sequence: `< < { } >`.\n2. Identify the open and close brackets:\n   - `<` is an open angle bracket.\n   - `>` is a close angle bracket.\n   - `{` is an open curly bracket.\n   - `}` is a close curly bracket.\n3. Count the number of open and close brackets:\n   - There are two open angle brackets `<` and one close angle bracket `>`.\n   - There is one open curly bracket `{` and one close curly bracket `}`.\n4. To balance the sequence, we need to add one more close angle bracket `>` to match the two open angle brackets.\n5. The completed sequence should be `< < { } > >`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"< < { } >\"\n\n# Add the missing closing angle bracket\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" >\"\n\n# Output the final answer in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more robustly, we can use a stack data structure to ensure that all types of brackets are balanced correctly. The stack will help us track open brackets and ensure that each one is properly closed. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of open brackets.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each character:\n   - If it's an open bracket (`<`, `{`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a close bracket (`>`, `}`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding open bracket. If so, pop the stack. If not, the sequence is unbalanced, and we need to add the corresponding open bracket to the stack.\n4. After processing the input sequence, any remaining open brackets in the stack need corresponding close brackets to balance the sequence.\n5. Construct the completed sequence by appending the necessary close brackets.\n6. Output the completed sequence enclosed with triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs of brackets\n    matching_brackets = {'<': '>', '{': '}'}\n    \n    # Initialize a stack to track open brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process each character in the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an open bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a close bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Properly closed, pop the stack\n            else:\n                # Unbalanced, add the corresponding open bracket to the stack\n                for open_bracket, close_bracket in matching_brackets.items():\n                    if close_bracket == char:\n                        stack.append(open_bracket)\n                        break\n    \n    # Construct the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< < { } >\"\n\n# Call the function to complete the sequence\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```",
