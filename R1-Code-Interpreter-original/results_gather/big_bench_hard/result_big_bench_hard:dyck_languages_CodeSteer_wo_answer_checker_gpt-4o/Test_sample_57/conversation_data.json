    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and braces such that all opening brackets and braces have corresponding closing ones. The input sequence is `< > {`, which means we have:\n\n1. An opening angle bracket `<` followed by a closing angle bracket `>`.\n2. An opening curly brace `{` that needs a corresponding closing curly brace `}`.\n\nThe task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brace and then output the final sequence in the specified format.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n- Start with the given sequence `< > {`.\n- Add the necessary closing curly brace `}` to complete the sequence.\n- Output the final sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"< > {\"\n\n# Add the necessary closing brace\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + \" }\"\n\n# Output the final sequence in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```",
    "To ensure that the sequence of brackets and braces is properly matched and closed, we can use a stack data structure. This approach will allow us to handle more complex sequences and ensure that all types of brackets are properly matched and closed.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets and braces.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. For each opening bracket or brace (`<`, `{`), push it onto the stack.\n4. For each closing bracket or brace (`>`, `}`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket or brace. If so, pop the stack.\n5. After processing the input, any remaining items in the stack need to be closed. Add the corresponding closing brackets or braces to complete the sequence.\n6. Output the final completed sequence in the format `<<<completed_sequence>>>`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'<': '>', '{': '}'}\n    \n    # Initialize a stack\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening bracket/brace\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing bracket/brace\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding necessary closing brackets/braces\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_pairs[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the final completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< > {\"\n\n# Call the function\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```",
    "To address the issue with the output format and ensure that spaces within the sequence are handled correctly, we need to adjust the final output format. The requirement is to output the completed sequence without adding extra angle brackets around it.\n\nHere's the updated plan:\n\n1. Use a stack to track opening brackets and braces.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. Push opening brackets or braces onto the stack.\n4. For closing brackets or braces, check if they match the top of the stack and pop if they do.\n5. After processing the input, add the necessary closing brackets or braces for any remaining items in the stack.\n6. Output the completed sequence directly without additional formatting.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'<': '>', '{': '}'}\n    \n    # Initialize a stack\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:  # If it's an opening bracket/brace\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():  # If it's a closing bracket/brace\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding necessary closing brackets/braces\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_pairs[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the final completed sequence\n    print(completed_sequence)\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< > {\"\n\n# Call the function\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence directly, ensuring that all brackets and braces are properly matched and closed, and it will handle spaces correctly."

    "The current code correctly identifies the need to close the curly brace, but the output format is incorrect due to an extra pair of angle brackets. Ensure that the output format matches the requirement by removing the extra angle brackets. Additionally, consider using more advanced techniques to handle sequences of brackets and braces, such as using a stack to ensure all types of brackets are properly matched and closed. This will make the solution more robust and adaptable to more complex inputs.",
    "The current implementation correctly uses a stack to ensure that all brackets and braces are properly matched and closed. However, the output format still includes an extra pair of angle brackets. Adjust the output to match the required format by removing the extra angle brackets. Additionally, ensure that the function handles spaces correctly within the sequence. This will improve the robustness and accuracy of the solution."
