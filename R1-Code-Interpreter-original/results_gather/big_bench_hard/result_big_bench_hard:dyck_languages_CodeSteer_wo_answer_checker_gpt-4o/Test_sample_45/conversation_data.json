    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets so that all the parentheses are properly closed. The input sequence is `< { ( ( )`. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Identify the Open Brackets**: We have the following open brackets in the sequence: `<`, `{`, `(`, `(`.\n2. **Identify the Closed Brackets**: We have one closed bracket `)`.\n3. **Determine the Missing Brackets**: We need to close all the open brackets in the reverse order they were opened. This means we need to add `)`, `)`, `}`, and `>` to the sequence.\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence**: Append the missing brackets to the input sequence to complete it.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = \"< { ( ( )\"\n\n# Open brackets stack\nopen_brackets = ['<', '{', '(', '(']\n\n# Closed brackets already present\nclosed_brackets = [')']\n\n# Determine the missing closing brackets\nmissing_closures = [')', ')', '}', '>']\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = sequence + ''.join(missing_closures)\n\n# Output the final answer\nprint(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
    "To enhance the solution, we can use a stack data structure to manage the opening and closing of brackets dynamically. This approach will ensure that the sequence is completed correctly, even for more complex inputs. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a list to simulate a stack for open brackets.\n2. **Define Matching Pairs**: Create a dictionary to map each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.\n3. **Process the Input**: Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If not, handle the mismatch (though the input guarantees a valid sequence up to the point of completion).\n4. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input, any remaining open brackets in the stack need to be closed. Pop each from the stack and append its corresponding closing bracket to the sequence.\n5. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the final sequence with all brackets properly closed.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef complete_bracket_sequence(sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs of brackets\n    matching_brackets = {'<': '>', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of open brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                # Handle mismatch (not expected in this task)\n                return \"Error: Mismatched brackets\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by closing remaining open brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[open_bracket]\n    \n    # Output the final answer\n    return f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\"\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< { ( ( )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_bracket_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly complete the sequence by ensuring all brackets are properly closed, even for more complex inputs."
