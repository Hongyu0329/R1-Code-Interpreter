    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. The input sequence is a mix of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. Our task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. This will help us match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket.\n2. **Iterate through the Input**: For each character in the input string:\n   - If it's an opening bracket (`<`, `[`, `{`, or `(`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it's a closing bracket (`>`, `]`, `}`, or `)`), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket. If so, pop the stack. If not, the sequence is invalid (though the problem assumes the input is valid up to the point given).\n3. **Complete the Sequence**: After processing the input, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need corresponding closing brackets. Pop each remaining opening bracket from the stack and append the appropriate closing bracket to the result.\n4. **Output the Completed Sequence**: Print the completed sequence in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Process the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ ] > ( ( ( { { { { ( ( { { } } ) ) } ( { } ) } } { { { [ { ( ) } ( ) ( ( { [ < < > > ] < < > > } ) ) ] ( { } { } ) } } } } )\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed, wrapped in the format `<<<answer>>>`."
