    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets, ensuring that all types of brackets are properly closed. The sequence includes different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. \n\nThe approach is to use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. As we iterate through the sequence, we push opening brackets onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, we pop the stack. If it doesn't, or if the stack is empty when we encounter a closing bracket, the sequence is not balanced. \n\nOnce we reach the end of the input sequence, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need to be closed. We will append the corresponding closing brackets to complete the sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input sequence.\n3. If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. If the character is a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack:\n   - If it matches, pop the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, the sequence is invalid (though the problem assumes a valid input).\n5. After processing the input, any remaining opening brackets in the stack need to be closed. Append the corresponding closing brackets to the result.\n6. Print the completed sequence in the format `<<<answer>>>`.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                # This case should not happen as per the problem statement\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ { { < ( ) > { < { } > ( < ( ) > { < [ ( { { ( < [ ] > ) } } { ( ( [ [ { } [ ] ] ] ) ) } ) ] > } ) } }\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence with all brackets properly closed.",
    "Let's review the logic for appending the closing brackets. The goal is to ensure that we only append the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence. The initial implementation might have added extra brackets due to incorrect handling of the stack or the output format.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n1. Use a stack to track opening brackets.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence:\n   - Push opening brackets onto the stack.\n   - For closing brackets, check if they match the top of the stack and pop the stack if they do.\n3. After processing the input, append the necessary closing brackets for any remaining opening brackets in the stack.\n4. Ensure the output format is exactly `<<<completed_sequence>>>`.\n\nLet's correct the code:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_brackets = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_brackets:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_brackets.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n    \n    # Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += matching_brackets[stack.pop()]\n    \n    # Output the completed sequence\n    print(f\"<<<{completed_sequence}>>>\")\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ { { < ( ) > { < { } > ( < ( ) > { < [ ( { { ( < [ ] > ) } } { ( ( [ [ { } [ ] ] ] ) ) } ) ] > } ) } }\"\ncomplete_sequence(input_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly append only the necessary closing brackets and output the completed sequence in the required format.",
