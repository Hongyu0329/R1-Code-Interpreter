    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Oranges are the second-cheapest.\n2. Apples are less expensive than pears.\n3. Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n4. Mangoes are the third-cheapest.\n5. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n6. Loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-cheapest, they are in position 3.\n- Oranges are the second-cheapest, so they are in position 2.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- Loquats are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n- Apples are less expensive than pears, so apples are before pears.\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions:\n\n1. Cantaloupes (since mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes and mangoes are third-cheapest, cantaloupes must be the cheapest)\n2. Oranges\n3. Mangoes\n4. Apples (since apples are less expensive than pears)\n5. Loquats\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears (since pears are more expensive than apples and the only position left is the most expensive)\n\nNow, we can see that the apples are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
