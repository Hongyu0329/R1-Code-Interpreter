    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Watermelons are the cheapest.\n2. Kiwis are the third-cheapest.\n3. Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n4. Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n5. Peaches are more expensive than mangoes.\n6. Peaches are less expensive than plums.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since watermelons are the cheapest, they are in position 1.\n- Kiwis are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes, so they must be in position 7.\n- Peaches are more expensive than mangoes, so mangoes must be in position 2 and peaches in position 4 or 5.\n- Peaches are less expensive than plums, so plums must be in position 5 if peaches are in position 4.\n\nNow, let's arrange them:\n\n1. Watermelons\n2. Mangoes\n3. Kiwis\n4. Peaches\n5. Plums\n6. Cantaloupes\n7. Oranges\n\nThe third-most expensive fruit is in position 5, which is plums.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
