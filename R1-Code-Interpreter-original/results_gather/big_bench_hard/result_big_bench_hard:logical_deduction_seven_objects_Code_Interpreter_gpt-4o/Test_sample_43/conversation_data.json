    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the birds according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The robin is to the left of the owl.\n2. The crow is the rightmost.\n3. The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\n4. The owl is the third from the right.\n5. The blue jay is to the left of the robin.\n6. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it must be in the 7th position.\n- The owl is the third from the right, which means it is in the 5th position.\n- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, so it is in the 4th position.\n- The raven is the second from the left, so it is in the 2nd position.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining birds (blue jay, falcon, robin) according to the remaining conditions:\n\n- The robin is to the left of the owl, so the robin must be in the 3rd position.\n- The blue jay is to the left of the robin, so the blue jay must be in the 1st position.\n- The only remaining position for the falcon is the 6th position.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Raven\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Owl\n6. Falcon\n7. Crow\n\nThe crow is the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The crow is the rightmost.\n\n<<<D>>>"
