    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the birds according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The falcon is to the right of the quail.\n2. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n3. The raven is to the left of the quail.\n4. The blue jay is the second from the left.\n5. The robin is the third from the left.\n6. The cardinal is the third from the right.\n\nLet's start by placing the birds according to the fixed positions:\n\n- The blue jay is the second from the left.\n- The robin is the third from the left.\n- The cardinal is the third from the right.\n\nThis gives us the following partial arrangement:\n\n1. ?\n2. Blue Jay\n3. Robin\n4. ?\n5. ?\n6. Cardinal\n7. ?\n\nNow, let's use the other conditions to fill in the gaps:\n\n- The falcon is to the right of the quail.\n- The raven is to the left of the quail.\n\nSince the cardinal is already in the third position from the right, the quail must be to the left of the cardinal, and the falcon must be to the right of the quail. The raven must be to the left of the quail.\n\nLet's try placing the quail in position 5 (since position 6 is occupied by the cardinal), which means the falcon must be in position 7. The raven, being to the left of the quail, must be in position 1.\n\nThis gives us:\n\n1. Raven\n2. Blue Jay\n3. Robin\n4. ?\n5. Quail\n6. Cardinal\n7. Falcon\n\nFinally, the hummingbird must be in position 4, as it is the only remaining position, and it satisfies the condition that the robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n\n1. Raven\n2. Blue Jay\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Quail\n6. Cardinal\n7. Falcon\n\nThe leftmost bird is the Raven.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
