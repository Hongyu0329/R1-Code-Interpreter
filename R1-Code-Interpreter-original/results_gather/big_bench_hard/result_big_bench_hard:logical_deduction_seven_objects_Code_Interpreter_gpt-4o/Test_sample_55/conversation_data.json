    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds on the branch according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.\n2. The quail is to the right of the crow.\n3. The raven is to the left of the robin.\n4. The blue jay is the third from the right.\n5. The cardinal is the leftmost.\n6. The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\n\nLet's start by placing the birds according to the fixed positions:\n\n- The cardinal is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n- The blue jay is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining positions using the other conditions:\n\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n- The quail is to the right of the crow, so the crow cannot be in position 7.\n- The raven is to the left of the robin.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n1. Cardinal\n2. Raven\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Blue Jay\n6. Crow\n7. Quail\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- The hummingbird (position 4) is to the left of the crow (position 6).\n- The quail (position 7) is to the right of the crow (position 6).\n- The raven (position 2) is to the left of the robin (position 3).\n- The blue jay is in position 5, which is the third from the right.\n- The cardinal is in position 1, which is the leftmost.\n- The hummingbird is in position 4, which is the fourth from the left.\n\nThe rightmost bird is the quail.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
