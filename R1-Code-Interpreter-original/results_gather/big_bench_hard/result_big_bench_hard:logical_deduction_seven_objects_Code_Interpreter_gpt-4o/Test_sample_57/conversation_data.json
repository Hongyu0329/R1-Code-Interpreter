    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the birds according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is to the right of the crow.\n2. The quail is the third from the left.\n3. The owl is to the right of the robin.\n4. The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.\n5. The cardinal is the second from the left.\n6. The owl is the third from the right.\n\nLet's start placing the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the second from the left, the arrangement starts with the crow followed by the cardinal: Crow, Cardinal, _, _, _, _, _.\n- The quail is the third from the left: Crow, Cardinal, Quail, _, _, _, _.\n- The owl is the third from the right, so it must be in the fifth position: Crow, Cardinal, Quail, _, Owl, _, _.\n- The owl is to the right of the robin, so the robin must be in the fourth position: Crow, Cardinal, Quail, Robin, Owl, _, _.\n- The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.
