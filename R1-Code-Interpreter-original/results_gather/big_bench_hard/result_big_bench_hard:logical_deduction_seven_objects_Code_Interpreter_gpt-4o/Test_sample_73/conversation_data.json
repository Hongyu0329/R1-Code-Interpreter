    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues:\n\n1. The pears are the second-cheapest.\n2. The peaches are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n3. The peaches are less expensive than the mangoes.\n4. The cantaloupes are more expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The oranges are the fourth-most expensive.\n6. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze the clues:\n\n- Since the pears are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- The watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- The oranges are the fourth-most expensive, so they are in position 4.\n- The peaches are more expensive than the cantaloupes and less expensive than the mangoes, so the order of these three must be: cantaloupes < peaches < mangoes.\n- The cantaloupes are more expensive than the kiwis, so kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n\nNow, let's try to place the fruits in order:\n\n1. Kiwis (since they are cheaper than cantaloupes)\n2. Pears (second-cheapest)\n3. Cantaloupes (cheaper than peaches)\n4. Oranges (fourth-most expensive)\n5. Peaches (more expensive than cantaloupes, less expensive than mangoes)\n6. Watermelons (second-most expensive)\n7. Mangoes (most expensive, since they are more expensive than peaches)\n\nThe kiwis are the cheapest. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
