    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the rightmost.\n2. The yellow book is the leftmost.\n3. The orange book is the second from the right.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the green book.\n5. The brown book is to the right of the black book.\n6. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n\nLet's arrange the books step by step:\n\n- Since the purple book is the rightmost, it is in position 7.\n- The yellow book is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n- The orange book is second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- The white book is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n\nNow, we have the following positions filled:\n1. Yellow\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. White\n5. ?\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNext, we need to place the brown, black, and green books according to the remaining conditions:\n\n- The brown book is to the left of the green book.\n- The brown book is to the right of the black book.\n\nSince the brown book must be to the right of the black book and to the left of the green book, the only possible positions for these books are:\n\n- Black in position 2\n- Brown in position 3\n- Green in position 5\n\nThis satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the arrangement is:\n\n1. Yellow\n2. Black\n3. Brown\n4. White\n5. Green\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nThe rightmost book is the purple book.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
