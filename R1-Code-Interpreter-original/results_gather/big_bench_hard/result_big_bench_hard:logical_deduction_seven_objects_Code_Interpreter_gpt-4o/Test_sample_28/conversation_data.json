    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The minivan is the oldest.\n2. The truck is older than the station wagon.\n3. The truck is newer than the limousine.\n4. The bus is newer than the convertible.\n5. The bus is older than the tractor.\n6. The limousine is newer than the tractor.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the minivan is the oldest, it is in the first position.\n- The truck is older than the station wagon, so the station wagon cannot be the second-oldest.\n- The truck is newer than the limousine, so the limousine is older than the truck.\n- The bus is newer than the convertible, so the convertible is older than the bus.\n- The bus is older than the tractor, so the tractor is newer than the bus.\n- The limousine is newer than the tractor, so the tractor is older than the limousine.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these conditions:\n\n1. Minivan (oldest)\n2. Convertible (since it is older than the bus)\n3. Bus (since it is older than the tractor)\n4. Tractor (since it is older than the limousine)\n5. Limousine (since it is older than the truck)\n6. Truck (since it is older than the station wagon)\n7. Station Wagon (newest)\n\nBased on this arrangement, the second-oldest vehicle is the convertible.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
