    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n2. The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n3. The plums are more expensive than the mangoes.\n4. The plums are less expensive than the peaches.\n5. The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\n6. The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since the loquats are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, which means they are in position 4.\n- The plums are more expensive than the mangoes, so they must be in position 5 or higher.\n- The plums are less expensive than the peaches, so the peaches must be in position 6 or 7.\n- The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes, so the cantaloupes must be in position 7.\n- The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats, so they must be in position 3 or higher.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Cheapest: ?\n2. Second-cheapest: Loquats\n3. Third-cheapest: ?\n4. Fourth-most expensive: Mangoes\n5. Fifth-most expensive: Plums\n6. Sixth-most expensive: Peaches\n7. Most expensive: Cantaloupes\n\nThe watermelons must be in position 3 because they are more expensive than the loquats and less expensive than the mangoes.\n\nNow, the only fruit left is the apples, which must be the cheapest.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Apples\n2. Loquats\n3. Watermelons\n4. Mangoes\n5. Plums\n6. Peaches\n7. Cantaloupes\n\nTherefore, the third-cheapest fruit is the watermelons.\n\nThe correct option is (F) The watermelons are the third-cheapest.\n\n<<<F>>>"
