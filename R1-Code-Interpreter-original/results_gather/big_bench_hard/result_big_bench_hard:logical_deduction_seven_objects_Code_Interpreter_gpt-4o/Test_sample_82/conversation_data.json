    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Watermelons are less expensive than plums.\n2. Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.\n3. Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n4. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n5. Plums are less expensive than mangoes.\n6. Mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we have two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive than mangoes.\n- From condition 5, plums are less expensive than mangoes, so plums cannot be in the top three.\n- From condition 1, watermelons are less expensive than plums, so watermelons are also not in the top three.\n- From condition 2, watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges are not in the top three.\n- From condition 3, kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis are not in the top three.\n- From condition 4, apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats are not in the top three.\n\nGiven that mangoes are the third-most expensive, and considering the above conditions, the only possible arrangement for the top three is:\n\n1. Most expensive: Apples\n2. Second-most expensive: Plums\n3. Third-most expensive: Mangoes\n\nNow, we need to arrange the remaining fruits (watermelons, oranges, kiwis, loquats) in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since watermelons are more expensive than oranges and less expensive than plums, they must be fourth.\n- Since kiwis are less expensive than oranges, they must be the cheapest.\n- Since loquats are less expensive than apples, they must be fifth.\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n\n1. Kiwis\n2. Oranges\n3. Watermelons\n4. Loquats\n5. Apples\n6. Plums\n7. Mangoes\n\nTherefore, the second-cheapest fruit is oranges.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
