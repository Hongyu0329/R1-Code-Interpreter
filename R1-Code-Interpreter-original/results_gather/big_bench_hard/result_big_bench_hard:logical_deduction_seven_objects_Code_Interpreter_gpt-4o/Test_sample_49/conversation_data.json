    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given conditions:\n\n1. Watermelons are less expensive than plums.\n2. Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.\n3. Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n4. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n5. Plums are less expensive than mangoes.\n6. Mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we have two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n- Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so plums cannot be one of the two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n- Watermelons are less expensive than plums, so watermelons are also less expensive than mangoes.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges are less expensive than watermelons.\n- Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis are less expensive than watermelons and oranges.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats are less expensive than apples.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Kiwis (since they are less expensive than oranges)\n2. Oranges (since they are less expensive than watermelons)\n3. Watermelons (since they are less expensive than plums)\n4. Plums (since they are less expensive than mangoes)\n5. Mangoes (since they are the third-most expensive)\n6. Apples (since they are more expensive than loquats)\n7. Loquats (since they are less expensive than apples)\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which fruit is the cheapest:\n\n- (A) The apples are the cheapest: No, apples are more expensive than loquats.\n- (B) The plums are the cheapest: No, plums are more expensive than watermelons.\n- (C) The mangoes are the cheapest: No, mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n- (D) The watermelons are the cheapest: No, watermelons are more expensive than oranges.\n- (E) The oranges are the cheapest: No, oranges are more expensive than kiwis.\n- (F) The kiwis are the cheapest: Yes, kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n- (G) The loquats are the cheapest: No, loquats are more expensive than kiwis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
