    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n2. The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\n3. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n4. The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The apples are more expensive than the loquats.\n6. The loquats are the third-cheapest.\n7. The plums are the cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the plums are the cheapest, they are in the first position.\n- The loquats are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- The apples are more expensive than the loquats, so they are in the fourth position.\n- The watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in the sixth position.\n- The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes, so the cantaloupes cannot be in the sixth or seventh position. They must be in the fifth position.\n- The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes, which is consistent with the apples being in the fourth position.\n- The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis, so the kiwis must be in the seventh position.\n- The pears are the only fruit left, so they must be in the seventh position.\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Plums\n2. (Unknown)\n3. Loquats\n4. Apples\n5. Cantaloupes\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nTherefore, the pears are the most expensive.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
