    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given clues:\n\n1. The pears are the third-cheapest.\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n3. The pears are more expensive than the plums.\n4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n6. The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n\n- Since the peaches are the second-cheapest, the order starts with the cheapest fruit, followed by peaches.\n- The pears are the third-cheapest, so they come after the peaches.\n- The plums are cheaper than the pears, so they must be the cheapest.\n- The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n- The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n- The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the order:\n\n1. Plums (cheapest)\n2. Peaches (second-cheapest)\n3. Pears (third-cheapest)\n4. Oranges (since they are less expensive than kiwis and more expensive than pears)\n5. Mangoes (third-most expensive)\n6. Kiwis (second-most expensive)\n7. Watermelons (most expensive, by elimination)\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the fourth-most expensive. According to the order, the fourth-most expensive fruit is the oranges.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
