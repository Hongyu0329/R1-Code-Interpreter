    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is the leftmost.\n2. The owl is the third from the left.\n3. The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n4. The raven is the third from the right.\n5. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail.\n6. The robin is to the left of the cardinal.\n\nLet's arrange the birds step by step:\n\n- Since the blue jay is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n- The owl is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n- The cardinal is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n- The raven is the third from the right, which is position 5.\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the quail, so the hummingbird must be in position 2, and the quail must be in position 7.\n- The robin is to the left of the cardinal, so the robin must be in position 6.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Hummingbird\n3. Owl\n4. Cardinal\n5. Raven\n6. Robin\n7. Quail\n\nThe only position left for the second from the right is position 6, which is occupied by the robin.\n\nTherefore, the robin is the second from the right.\n\nThe correct option is (G).\n\n<<<G>>>"
