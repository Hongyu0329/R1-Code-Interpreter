    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Pears are the second-cheapest.\n2. Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n3. Peaches are less expensive than mangoes.\n4. Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis.\n5. Oranges are the fourth-most expensive.\n6. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, they are in position 2 from the top.\n- Oranges are the fourth-most expensive, so they are in position 4 from the top.\n- Pears are the second-cheapest, so they are in position 2 from the bottom (or position 6 from the top).\n- Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes but less expensive than mangoes, so they must be in between cantaloupes and mangoes.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis.\n\nNow, let's try to place the fruits in order:\n\n1. Mangoes (most expensive)\n2. Watermelons\n3. Peaches\n4. Oranges\n5. Cantaloupes\n6. Pears\n7. Kiwis (cheapest)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- Oranges are the fourth-most expensive.\n- Pears are the second-cheapest.\n- Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes and less expensive than mangoes.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis.\n\nTherefore, the third-most expensive fruit is peaches.\n\nThe correct option is (G) The peaches are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<G>>>"
