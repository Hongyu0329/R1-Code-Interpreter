    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The pears are the third-cheapest.\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n3. The pears are more expensive than the plums.\n4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n6. The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since the peaches are the second-cheapest, they must be placed in the second position.\n- The pears are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- The kiwis are the second-most expensive, so they are in the sixth position.\n- The mangoes are the third-most expensive, so they are in the fifth position.\n- The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis, so they must be in a position before the kiwis.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n1. Cheapest: ?\n2. Second-cheapest: Peaches\n3. Third-cheapest: Pears\n4. ?\n5. Third-most expensive: Mangoes\n6. Second-most expensive: Kiwis\n7. Most expensive: ?\n\nThe plums must be cheaper than the pears, so they must be in the first position. The oranges must be less expensive than the kiwis, so they must be in the fourth position. The only fruit left is the watermelons, which must be the most expensive.\n\nThe final order is:\n\n1. Plums\n2. Peaches\n3. Pears\n4. Oranges\n5. Mangoes\n6. Kiwis\n7. Watermelons\n\nThe second-cheapest fruit is the peaches.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (F) The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<F>>>"
