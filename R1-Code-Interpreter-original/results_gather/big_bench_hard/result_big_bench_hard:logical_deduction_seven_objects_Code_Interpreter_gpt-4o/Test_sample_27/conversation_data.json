Mel finished above Eli.\n4. Ada finished below Dan.\n5. Ana finished third.\n6. Eli finished second.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since Eli finished second, the order is: ___, Eli, Ana, ___, ___, ___, ___.\n- Ana finished third, so the order is: ___, Eli, Ana, ___, ___, ___, ___.\n- Mel finished above Eli, so Mel must be first: Mel, Eli, Ana, ___, ___, ___, ___.\n- Ada finished below Dan, so Dan must be fourth: Mel, Eli, Ana, Dan, ___, ___, ___.\n- Ada finished above Rob, and Eve finished below Rob. Therefore, Ada must be fifth, Rob sixth, and Eve seventh: Mel, Eli, Ana, Dan, Ada, Rob, Eve.\n\nNow, let's determine who finished fourth:\n\n- The order is: Mel, Eli, Ana, Dan, Ada, Rob, Eve.\n\nDan finished fourth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
