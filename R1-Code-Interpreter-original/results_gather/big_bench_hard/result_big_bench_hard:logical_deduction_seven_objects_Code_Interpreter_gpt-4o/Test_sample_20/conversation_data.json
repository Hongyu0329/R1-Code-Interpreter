    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in order based on the given clues:\n\n1. The owl is the second from the right.\n2. The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n3. The falcon is to the left of the blue jay.\n4. The quail is to the left of the falcon.\n5. The raven is the second from the left.\n6. The robin is to the left of the quail.\n\nLet's start by placing the birds based on the fixed positions given:\n\n- The owl is the second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- The cardinal is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n- The raven is the second from the left, so it is in position 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining birds: falcon, blue jay, quail, and robin. We need to place them in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n- The falcon is to the left of the blue jay, so falcon must be in a position before the blue jay.\n- The quail is to the left of the falcon, so quail must be in a position before the falcon.\n- The robin is to the left of the quail, so robin must be in a position before the quail.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n1. Position 1: Robin (since it must be to the left of the quail)\n2. Position 2: Raven (already placed)\n3. Position 3: Quail (since it must be to the left of the falcon)\n4. Position 4: Cardinal (already placed)\n5. Position 5: Falcon (since it must be to the left of the blue jay)\n6. Position 6: Owl (already placed)\n7. Position 7: Blue Jay (since it must be to the right of the falcon)\n\nNow, let's check which bird is in the second position from the right:\n\n- Position 6 (second from the right): Owl\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
