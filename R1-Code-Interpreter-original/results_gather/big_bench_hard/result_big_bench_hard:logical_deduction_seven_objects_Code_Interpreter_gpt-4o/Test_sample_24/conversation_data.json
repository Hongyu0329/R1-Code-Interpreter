    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a sequence based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is the second from the left.\n2. The robin is the third from the left.\n3. The cardinal is the third from the right.\n4. The falcon is to the right of the quail.\n5. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n6. The raven is to the left of the quail.\n\nLet's start by placing the birds based on the fixed positions:\n\n- The blue jay is the second from the left: _ B _ _ _ _ _\n- The robin is the third from the left: _ B R _ _ _ _\n- The cardinal is the third from the right: _ B R _ _ C _\n\nNow, let's use the remaining conditions to place the other birds:\n\n- The raven is to the left of the quail, and the falcon is to the right of the quail. This means the quail cannot be in the first position, and the raven cannot be in the last position.\n- The robin is to the right of the hummingbird, so the hummingbird must be in one of the first two positions.\n\nLet's try placing the hummingbird in the first position:\n\n- H B R _ _ C _\n\nNow, we need to place the raven, quail, and falcon:\n\n- The raven is to the left of the quail, and the falcon is to the right of the quail. The only positions left are the fourth, fifth, and seventh.\n\nLet's try placing the raven in the fourth position:\n\n- H B R V _ C _\n\nNow, the quail must be in the fifth position, and the falcon in the seventh:\n\n- H B R V Q C F\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is the second from the left.\n2. The robin is the third from the left.\n3. The cardinal is the third from the right.\n4. The falcon is to the right of the quail.\n5. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n6. The raven is to the left of the quail.\n\nThe rightmost bird is the falcon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
