    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Plums are the cheapest.\n2. Watermelons are the third-most expensive.\n3. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n4. Kiwis are the most expensive.\n5. Apples are less expensive than peaches.\n6. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n- Since plums are the cheapest, they are in position 1.\n- Loquats are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- Watermelons are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n- Kiwis are the most expensive, so they are in position 7.\n\nNow, we have the following positions filled:\n1. Plums\n2. ?\n3. Loquats\n4. ?\n5. Watermelons\n6. ?\n7. Kiwis\n\nNext, we know:\n- Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n- Apples are less expensive than peaches.\n\nThis means that the order of apples, oranges, and peaches must be such that oranges are the least expensive among them, and peaches are the most expensive among them.\n\nLet's fill in the remaining positions:\n- Since apples are less expensive than peaches, apples cannot be in position 6. Therefore, apples must be in position 4.\n- Since apples are more expensive than oranges, oranges must be in position 2.\n- Peaches, being more expensive than apples, must be in position 6.\n\nNow, the order is:\n1. Plums\n2. Oranges\n3. Loquats\n4. Apples\n5. Watermelons\n6. Peaches\n7. Kiwis\n\nFrom the options given, the second-most expensive fruit is peaches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
