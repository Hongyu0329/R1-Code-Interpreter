    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The oranges are the second-cheapest.\n2. The apples are less expensive than the pears.\n3. The mangoes are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n4. The mangoes are the third-cheapest.\n5. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n6. The loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since the oranges are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- The mangoes are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- The watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- The loquats are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n- The apples are less expensive than the pears, so apples are before pears.\n- The mangoes are more expensive than the cantaloupes, so cantaloupes are before mangoes.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits:\n\n1. Cheapest: Cantaloupes (since they are cheaper than mangoes)\n2. Oranges\n3. Mangoes\n4. Apples (since they are cheaper than pears)\n5. Loquats\n6. Watermelons\n7. Most expensive: Pears\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The loquats are the second-most expensive - False, they are third-most expensive.\n(B) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive - False, they are the cheapest.\n(C) The watermelons are the second-most expensive - True.\n(D) The apples are the second-most expensive - False, they are fourth.\n(E) The oranges are the second-most expensive - False, they are second-cheapest.\n(F) The pears are the second-most expensive - False, they are the most expensive.\n(G) The mangoes are the second-most expensive - False, they are third-cheapest.\n\nThe correct option is (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
