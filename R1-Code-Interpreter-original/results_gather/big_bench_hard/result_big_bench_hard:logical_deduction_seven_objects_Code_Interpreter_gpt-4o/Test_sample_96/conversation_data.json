    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n3. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n4. Loquats are less expensive than kiwis.\n5. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n6. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n7. Plums are the cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since plums are the cheapest, they are in the first position.\n- Loquats are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in the sixth position.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats and less expensive than cantaloupes, so they are in the fourth position.\n- Loquats are less expensive than kiwis, so kiwis are in the fifth position.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than apples, so they are in the seventh position.\n- Pears are the only fruit left, so they are in the second position.\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Plums\n2. Pears\n3. Loquats\n4. Apples\n5. Kiwis\n6. Watermelons\n7. Cantaloupes\n\nThe third-cheapest fruit is loquats.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The loquats are the third-cheapest.\n\nFinal answer: <<<G>>>"
