    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Watermelons are less expensive than plums.\n2. Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.\n3. Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n4. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n5. Plums are less expensive than mangoes.\n6. Mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we can place them in the third position.\n- Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so plums cannot be in the first or second position.\n- Watermelons are less expensive than plums, so watermelons cannot be in the first, second, or third position.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be in the fourth position or higher.\n- Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis must be in the last position.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats cannot be in the first position.\n\nLet's try to arrange the fruits based on these constraints:\n\n1. Apples\n2. Plums\n3. Mangoes\n4. Watermelons\n5. Oranges\n6. Loquats\n7. Kiwis\n\nNow, let's verify if this arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Watermelons (4) are less expensive than plums (2).\n- Watermelons (4) are more expensive than oranges (5).\n- Kiwis (7) are less expensive than oranges (5).\n- Apples (1) are more expensive than loquats (6).\n- Plums (2) are less expensive than mangoes (3).\n- Mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the apples are the most expensive.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
