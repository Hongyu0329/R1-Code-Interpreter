    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished below Amy.\n2. Joe finished below Dan.\n3. Dan finished below Ada.\n4. Mel finished third-to-last.\n5. Amy finished third.\n6. Rob finished below Mya.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n- Since Amy finished third, the order for the top three is not affected by the other conditions. So, Amy is in the third position.\n- Mel finished third-to-last, which means Mel is in the 5th position.\n- Ada finished below Amy, so Ada must be in the 4th position (since 1st and 2nd are above Amy).\n- Dan finished below Ada, so Dan must be in the 6th or 7th position.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe must be in the 7th position.\n- Rob finished below Mya, so Rob must be in the 6th or 7th position, but since Joe is in the 7th position, Rob must be in the 6th position.\n- Mya must be in the 1st or 2nd position, but since Rob is below Mya, Mya must be in the 2nd position.\n- This leaves the 1st position for Dan.\n\nThe order is:\n1. Dan\n2. Mya\n3. Amy\n4. Ada\n5. Mel\n6. Rob\n7. Joe\n\nTherefore, Joe finished last.\n\nThe answer is: <<<A>>>."
