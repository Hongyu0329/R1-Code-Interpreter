    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and determine which book is the rightmost.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n1. The yellow book is the rightmost.\n2. The blue book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The green book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n5. The black book is the fourth from the left.\n6. The brown book is the third from the right.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it must be in the 7th position.\n- The black book is the fourth from the left, so it is in the 4th position.\n- The brown book is the third from the right, so it is in the 5th position.\n- The blue book is to the left of the orange book, and the blue book is to the right of the green book. This means the order of these three books must be: green, blue, orange.\n- The green book is to the right of the white book.\n\nLet's place the books in order:\n\n1. White book\n2. Green book\n3. Blue book\n4. Black book\n5. Brown book\n6. Orange book\n7.
