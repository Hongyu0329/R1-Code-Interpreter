    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues:\n\n1. The loquats are less expensive than the oranges.\n2. The oranges are the third-most expensive.\n3. The apples are the cheapest.\n4. The kiwis are more expensive than the pears.\n5. The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons.\n6. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n\nLet's analyze the clues:\n\n- From clue 3, we know that apples are the cheapest.\n- From clue 2, oranges are the third-most expensive.\n- From clue 1, loquats are less expensive than oranges, so loquats are not the third-most expensive.\n- From clue 6, loquats are more expensive than kiwis, so kiwis are not the second-most expensive.\n- From clue 4, kiwis are more expensive than pears, so pears are not the second-most expensive.\n- From clue 5, mangoes are more expensive than watermelons, so watermelons are not the second-most expensive.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the order of the fruits:\n\n1. Apples (cheapest)\n2. Pears (since kiwis are more expensive than pears)\n3. Kiwis (since loquats are more expensive than kiwis)\n4. Loquats (since loquats are less expensive than oranges)\n5. Oranges (third-most expensive)\n6. Watermelons (since mangoes are more expensive than watermelons)\n7. Mangoes (most expensive)\n\nNow, let's identify the correct option:\n\n- Option (E) states that the apples are the cheapest, which matches our analysis.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
