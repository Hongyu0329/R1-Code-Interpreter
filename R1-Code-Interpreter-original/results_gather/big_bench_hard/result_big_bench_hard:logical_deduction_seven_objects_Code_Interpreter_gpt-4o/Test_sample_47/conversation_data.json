The orange book is to the left of the green book.\n6. The blue book is the third from the right.\n\nLet's arrange the books step by step:\n\n- Since the brown book is the rightmost, it is in position 7.\n- The gray book is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n- The blue book is the third from the right, so it is in position 5.\n- The orange book is to the right of the gray book and to the left of the green book. Therefore, the orange book can be in position 4, and the green book can be in position 6.\n- The black book is to the right of the white book.
