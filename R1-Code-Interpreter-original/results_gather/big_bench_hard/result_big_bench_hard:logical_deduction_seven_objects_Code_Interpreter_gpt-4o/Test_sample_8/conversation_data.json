The truck is older than the limousine.\n5. The hatchback is the third-oldest.\n6. The bus is newer than the limousine.\n\nLet's arrange the vehicles based on these clues:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it is in position 2.\n- The hatchback is the third-oldest, so it is in position 3.\n- The tractor is the fourth-newest, which means it is in position 4 from the end, or position 4 from the newest. Since there are 7 vehicles, the tractor is in position 4 from the end, which is position 4 from the oldest.\n- The minivan is older than the truck, and the truck is older than the limousine. This means the order of these three vehicles is: minivan, truck, limousine.\n- The bus is newer than the limousine, so it must be in the last position.\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions:\n\n1. Oldest: ?\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Tractor\n5. Minivan\n6. Truck\n7. Limousine\n8. Newest: Bus\n\nThe only position left for the oldest vehicle is position 1.
