    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues:\n\n1. The pears are more expensive than the oranges.\n2. The oranges are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n3. The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\n4. The apples are the third-cheapest.\n5. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n6. The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nLet's analyze the clues:\n\n- From clues 1 and 2, we know: Pears > Oranges > Cantaloupes.\n- From clue 3, we know: Cantaloupes > Peaches.\n- From clue 4, we know: Apples are the third-cheapest.\n- From clue 5, we know: Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- From clue 6, we know: Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Cheapest: ?\n2. Second-cheapest: ?\n3. Third-cheapest: Apples\n4. Fourth-cheapest: ?\n5. Fourth-most expensive: Mangoes\n6. Second-most expensive: Watermelons\n7. Most expensive: ?\n\nNow, let's fill in the gaps using the clues:\n\n- Since Apples are the third-cheapest, there are two fruits cheaper than Apples.\n- Since Watermelons are the second-most expensive, there is one fruit more expensive than Watermelons.\n- Since Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, there are three fruits cheaper than Mangoes.\n\nUsing the information that Pears > Oranges > Cantaloupes and Cantaloupes > Peaches, we can deduce:\n\n- Peaches must be the cheapest because they are less expensive than Cantaloupes, which are less expensive than Oranges, which are less expensive than Pears.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n1. Cheapest: Peaches\n2. Second-cheapest: Cantaloupes\n3. Third-cheapest: Apples\n4. Fourth-cheapest: Oranges\n5. Fourth-most expensive: Mangoes\n6. Second-most expensive: Watermelons\n7. Most expensive: Pears\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the cheapest fruit is Peaches.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
