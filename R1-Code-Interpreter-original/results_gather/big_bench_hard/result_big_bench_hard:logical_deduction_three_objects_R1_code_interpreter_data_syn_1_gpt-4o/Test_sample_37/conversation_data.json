On a branch, there are three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\nOptions:\n(A) The blue jay is the rightmost\n(B) The quail is the rightmost\n(C) The falcon is the rightmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the falcon is positioned to the right of the blue jay. This means the blue jay cannot be the rightmost bird.\n- From statement 2, we know that the blue jay is positioned to the right of the quail. This means the quail cannot be the rightmost bird.\n\nGiven these two statements, the only bird that can be the rightmost is the falcon. Therefore, the order from left to right is: quail, blue jay, falcon.\n\nNow, let's determine which option corresponds to this order:\n\n- Option (A) states that the blue jay is the rightmost, which is incorrect.\n- Option (B) states that the quail is the rightmost, which is incorrect.\n- Option (C) states that the falcon is the rightmost, which is correct.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
