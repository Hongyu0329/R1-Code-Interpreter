    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: oranges, mangoes, and plums. The given conditions are:\n\n1. Plums are less expensive than mangoes.\n2. Oranges are less expensive than plums.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Plums < Mangoes\n- From condition 2, we know: Oranges < Plums\n\nNow, let's arrange these fruits in order of increasing price based on the conditions:\n\n- Since Oranges < Plums and Plums < Mangoes, the order from least to most expensive is: Oranges, Plums, Mangoes.\n\nWith this order, we can determine which fruit is the second-most expensive:\n\n- The first (least expensive) is Oranges.\n- The second (middle in price) is Plums.\n- The third (most expensive) is Mangoes.\n\nTherefore, the plums are the second-most expensive fruit.\n\nThe correct option is (C) The plums are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
