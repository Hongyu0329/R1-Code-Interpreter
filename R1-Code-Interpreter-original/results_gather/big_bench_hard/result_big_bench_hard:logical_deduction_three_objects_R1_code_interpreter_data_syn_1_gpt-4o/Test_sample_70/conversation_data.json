On a shelf, there are three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a green book. The green book is the leftmost. The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\nOptions:\n(A) The blue book is the leftmost\n(B) The orange book is the leftmost\n(C) The green book is the leftmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the leftmost book.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. The green book is the leftmost.\n2. The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the green book is the leftmost. This directly contradicts option (A) and option (B), which state that the blue book and the orange book are the leftmost, respectively.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the orange book is to the left of the blue book. This means the order from left to right cannot be blue, orange, green.\n\nLet's verify the order:\n- The green book is the leftmost.\n- The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n\nThe only order that satisfies both conditions is:\n1. Green book\n2. Orange book\n3. Blue book\n\nThus, the green book is indeed the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The green book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
