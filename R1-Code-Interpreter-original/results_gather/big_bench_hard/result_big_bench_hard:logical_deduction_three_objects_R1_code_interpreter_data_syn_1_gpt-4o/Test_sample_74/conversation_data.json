    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan, and the truck, based on the given statements.\n\n1. The minivan is newer than the truck.\n   - This implies that the truck is older than the minivan.\n\n2. The station wagon is newer than the minivan.\n   - This implies that the minivan is older than the station wagon.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order from oldest to newest:\n- Truck (oldest)\n- Minivan\n- Station Wagon (newest)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n(A) The station wagon is the oldest - This is incorrect because the station wagon is the newest.\n(B) The minivan is the oldest - This is incorrect because the minivan is newer than the truck.\n(C) The truck is the oldest - This is correct because the truck is older than both the minivan and the station wagon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
