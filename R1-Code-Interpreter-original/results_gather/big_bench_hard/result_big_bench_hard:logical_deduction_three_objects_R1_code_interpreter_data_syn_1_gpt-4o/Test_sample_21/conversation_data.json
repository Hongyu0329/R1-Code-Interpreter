    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is to the right of the orange book.\n2. The orange book is to the right of the black book.\n\nLet's analyze the possible positions for each book:\n\n- Since the orange book is to the right of the black book, the black book cannot be in the middle or on the right. Therefore, the black book must be on the left.\n- Since the blue book is to the right of the orange book, the blue book cannot be in the middle or on the left. Therefore, the blue book must be on the right.\n- This leaves the orange book to be in the middle position.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: Black book, Orange book, Blue book.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The black book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the black book is the first from the left.\n(B) The orange book is the second from the left - This is correct because the orange book is indeed in the middle.\n(C) The blue book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the blue book is the third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
