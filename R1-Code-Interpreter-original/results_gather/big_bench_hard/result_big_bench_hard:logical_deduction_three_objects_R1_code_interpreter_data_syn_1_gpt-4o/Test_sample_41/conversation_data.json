    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: cantaloupes, oranges, and watermelons. The statements given are:\n\n1. The oranges are the most expensive.\n2. The cantaloupes are more expensive than the watermelons.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that oranges are at the top of the price list. From statement 2, we know that cantaloupes are more expensive than watermelons. Therefore, the order from most expensive to least expensive is:\n\n1. Oranges\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Watermelons\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the cheapest. Based on the order above, watermelons are the least expensive.\n\nThus, the correct option is (C) The watermelons are the cheapest.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
