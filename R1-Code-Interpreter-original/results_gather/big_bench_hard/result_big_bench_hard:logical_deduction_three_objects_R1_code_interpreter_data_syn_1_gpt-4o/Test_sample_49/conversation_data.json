    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n2. The green book is to the left of the brown book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the green book is to the left of the brown book, the green book cannot be in the second or third position. Therefore, the green book must be the first book on the left.\n- The brown book is to the left of the orange book, so the brown book cannot be in the third position. Since the green book is already in the first position, the brown book must be in the second position.\n- This leaves the orange book to be in the third position.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Green, Brown, Orange.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The green book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the green book is the first from the left.\n(B) The brown book is the second from the left - This is correct because the brown book is indeed the second from the left.\n(C) The orange book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the orange book is the third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
