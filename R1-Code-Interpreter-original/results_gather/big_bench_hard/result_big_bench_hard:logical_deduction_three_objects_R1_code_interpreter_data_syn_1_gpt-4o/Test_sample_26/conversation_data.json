    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative prices of the three fruits: peaches, pears, and mangoes, based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: The mangoes are less expensive than the peaches.\n   - This implies: Peaches > Mangoes\n\n2. **Statement 2**: The mangoes are more expensive than the pears.\n   - This implies: Mangoes > Pears\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices:\n- Peaches > Mangoes > Pears\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A)**: The peaches are the most expensive.\n  - This is consistent with our deduced order: Peaches > Mangoes > Pears.\n\n- **Option (B)**: The pears are the most expensive.\n  - This contradicts our deduced order, as Pears are the least expensive.\n\n- **Option (C)**: The mangoes are the most expensive.\n  - This contradicts our deduced order, as Mangoes are more expensive than Pears but less expensive than Peaches.\n\nBased on the logical deductions, the correct answer is Option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
