On a branch, there are three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\nOptions:\n(A) The blue jay is the leftmost\n(B) The quail is the leftmost\n(C) The falcon is the leftmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the order between the falcon and the blue jay is: Blue Jay -> Falcon.\n- From statement 2, we know that the order between the blue jay and the quail is: Quail -> Blue Jay.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can deduce the complete order of the birds on the branch:\n\nQuail -> Blue Jay -> Falcon\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The blue jay is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the quail is to the left of the blue jay.\n(B) The quail is the leftmost: This is correct because the quail is the first in the order.\n(C) The falcon is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the falcon is to the right of both the quail and the blue jay.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
