    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Eve finished below Eli.\n2. Eve finished above Mya.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Eli finished above Eve, so Eli is not in the last position.\n- Eve finished above Mya, so Mya is in the last position.\n\nThis gives us the order: Eli, Eve, Mya.\n\nNow, let's determine who finished second:\n\n- Eli is first.\n- Eve is second.\n- Mya is third.\n\nTherefore, Eve finished second.\n\nThe correct option is (C) Eve finished second.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
