    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age. We have three vehicles: a motorcycle, a minivan, and a tractor. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n2. The minivan is the second-newest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the minivan is not the newest, and it is not the oldest. Therefore, the minivan is in the middle in terms of age.\n\nGiven that the minivan is older than the tractor (statement 1), the tractor must be the newest. This is because if the minivan is older than the tractor and is the second-newest, the only possibility is that the tractor is the newest.\n\nLet's verify this with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The motorcycle is the newest: This cannot be true because the minivan is the second-newest, and the tractor is newer than the minivan.\n- (B) The minivan is the newest: This cannot be true because the minivan is the second-newest.\n- (C) The tractor is the newest: This is consistent with the information given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
