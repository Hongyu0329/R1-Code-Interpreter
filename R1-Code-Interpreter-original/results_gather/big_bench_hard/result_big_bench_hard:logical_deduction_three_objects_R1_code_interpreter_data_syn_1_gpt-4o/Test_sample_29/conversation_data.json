    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The yellow book is to the right of the red book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 2, we know that the red book is the leftmost because the yellow book is to its right.\n- From condition 1, we know that the purple book is to the right of the yellow book.\n\nBased on these conditions, the order from left to right is: Red book, Yellow book, Purple book.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is the rightmost:\n\n- The purple book is to the right of both the yellow and red books.\n\nTherefore, the purple book is the rightmost.\n\nThe correct option is (A) The purple book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
