    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n2. The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- The first condition tells us that the orange book is somewhere to the left of the blue book.\n- The second condition tells us that the yellow book is somewhere to the right of the blue book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order of the books from left to right is:\n\n- Orange book\n- Blue book\n- Yellow book\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n(A) The orange book is the leftmost - This matches our determined order.\n(B) The blue book is the leftmost - This does not match our determined order.\n(C) The yellow book is the leftmost - This does not match our determined order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
