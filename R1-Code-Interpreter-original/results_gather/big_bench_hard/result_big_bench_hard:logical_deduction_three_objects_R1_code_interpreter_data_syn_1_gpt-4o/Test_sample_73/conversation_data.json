    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: kiwis, loquats, and cantaloupes. The given conditions are:\n\n1. Kiwis are less expensive than loquats.\n2. Cantaloupes are less expensive than kiwis.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, we know: Kiwis < Loquats\n- From condition 2, we know: Cantaloupes < Kiwis\n\nNow, let's deduce the order of the fruits based on their prices:\n\n- Since cantaloupes are less expensive than kiwis, and kiwis are less expensive than loquats, the order from least to most expensive is: Cantaloupes < Kiwis < Loquats.\n\nWith this order, we can determine which fruit is the second-most expensive:\n\n- The least expensive is cantaloupes.\n- The second-most expensive is kiwis.\n- The most expensive is loquats.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
