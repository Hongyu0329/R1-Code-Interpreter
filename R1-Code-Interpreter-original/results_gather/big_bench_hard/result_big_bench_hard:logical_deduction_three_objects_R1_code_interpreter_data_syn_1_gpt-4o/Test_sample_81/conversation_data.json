    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Amy finished below Ana.\n2. Ana finished below Joe.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Joe finished first because Ana finished below Joe.\n- Ana finished second because Amy finished below Ana.\n- Amy finished third because she finished below both Ana and Joe.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Amy finished second: This is incorrect because Amy finished third.\n- (B) Ana finished second: This is correct because Ana finished second.\n- (C) Joe finished second: This is incorrect because Joe finished first.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
