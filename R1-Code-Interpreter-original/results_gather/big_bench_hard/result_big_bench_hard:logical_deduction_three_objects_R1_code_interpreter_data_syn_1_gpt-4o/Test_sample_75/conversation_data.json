On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a black book, and a purple book. The black book is to the left of the purple book. The purple book is to the left of the white book.\nOptions:\n(A) The white book is the leftmost\n(B) The black book is the leftmost\n(C) The purple book is the leftmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The black book is to the left of the purple book.\n2. The purple book is to the left of the white book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, we know that the black book is positioned somewhere to the left of the purple book.\n- From condition 2, we know that the purple book is positioned somewhere to the left of the white book.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The black book must be the leftmost because it is to the left of the purple book.\n- The purple book is in the middle because it is to the left of the white book but to the right of the black book.\n- The white book is the rightmost because it is to the right of the purple book.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: Black book, Purple book, White book.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The white book is the leftmost - This is incorrect because the white book is the rightmost.\n- (B) The black book is the leftmost - This is correct because the black book is indeed the leftmost.\n- (C) The purple book is the leftmost - This is incorrect because the purple book is in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
