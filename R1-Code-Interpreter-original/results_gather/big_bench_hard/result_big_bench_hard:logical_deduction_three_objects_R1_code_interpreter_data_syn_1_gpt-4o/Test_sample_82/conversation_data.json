    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Mya finished below Ada.\n2. Mel finished above Ada.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since Mya finished below Ada, Ada did not finish last. Therefore, Mya must be in the last position.\n- Since Mel finished above Ada, Mel must be in the first position because there are only three golfers.\n\nGiven these inferences, the order of finishing is:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Ada\n3. Mya\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Ada finished second: This is consistent with our inferred order.\n- (B) Mel finished second: This is not consistent, as Mel finished first.\n- (C) Mya finished second: This is not consistent, as Mya finished last.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
