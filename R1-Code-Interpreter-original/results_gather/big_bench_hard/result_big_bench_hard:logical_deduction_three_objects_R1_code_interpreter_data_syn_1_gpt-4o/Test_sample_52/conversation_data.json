    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is to the left of the red book.\n2. The gray book is to the left of the purple book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the purple book is to the left of the red book, the red book cannot be the leftmost book.\n- Since the gray book is to the left of the purple book, the purple book cannot be the leftmost book.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the order of the books from left to right:\n\n- Gray book\n- Purple book\n- Red book\n\nNow, let's determine which book is the rightmost:\n\n- The red book is the rightmost because it is to the right of both the gray and purple books.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The red book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
