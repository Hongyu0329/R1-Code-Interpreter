    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given information. The problem states:\n\n1. Mel finished last.\n2. Ana finished second.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Mel finished last, Mel is in the third position.\n- Since Ana finished second, Ana is in the second position.\n- This leaves Ada to be in the first position.\n\nNow, let's match this information with the options provided:\n\n(A) Mel finished last - This is consistent with the information given.\n(B) Ada finished last - This contradicts the information since Mel finished last.\n(C) Ana finished last - This contradicts the information since Ana finished second.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) Mel finished last.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
