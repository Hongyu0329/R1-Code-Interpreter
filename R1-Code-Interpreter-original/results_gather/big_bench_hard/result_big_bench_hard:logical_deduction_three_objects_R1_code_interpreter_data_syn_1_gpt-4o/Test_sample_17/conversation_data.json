    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of each book on the shelf based on the given information. We have three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a red book. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The blue book is the rightmost.\n2. The orange book is the leftmost.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since the blue book is the rightmost, it must be in the third position.\n- Since the orange book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- This leaves the red book to be in the second position, as it is the only position left.\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The blue book is the rightmost - This is consistent with the given information.\n(B) The orange book is the rightmost - This contradicts the given information, as the orange book is the leftmost.\n(C) The red book is the rightmost - This contradicts the given information, as the blue book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
