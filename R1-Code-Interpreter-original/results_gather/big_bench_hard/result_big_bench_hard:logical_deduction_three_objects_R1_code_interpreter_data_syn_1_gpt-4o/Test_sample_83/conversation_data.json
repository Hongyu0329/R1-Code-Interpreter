    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the convertible, the motorcycle, and the truck, based on the given statements.\n\n1. The motorcycle is newer than the convertible.\n2. The convertible is newer than the truck.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order in terms of age (from newest to oldest):\n\n- The motorcycle is newer than the convertible, so the motorcycle is not the oldest.\n- The convertible is newer than the truck, so the convertible is not the oldest.\n\nThus, the order from newest to oldest is:\n1. Motorcycle (newest)\n2. Convertible\n3. Truck (oldest)\n\nBased on this order, the motorcycle is the newest vehicle.\n\nNow, let's match this conclusion with the given options:\n(A) The convertible is the newest - Incorrect\n(B) The motorcycle is the newest - Correct\n(C) The truck is the newest - Incorrect\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
