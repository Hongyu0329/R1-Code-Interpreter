    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the orange book.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. There are three books: red, blue, and orange.\n2. The red book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The orange book is the second from the left.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know the orange book is in the second position. Therefore, the arrangement must be:\n\n- First position: Red book (since it must be to the left of the orange book)\n- Second position: Orange book\n- Third position: Blue book\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The red book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the red book is in the first position.\n(B) The blue book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the blue book is in the third position.\n(C) The orange book is the second from the left - This is correct because the orange book is indeed in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
