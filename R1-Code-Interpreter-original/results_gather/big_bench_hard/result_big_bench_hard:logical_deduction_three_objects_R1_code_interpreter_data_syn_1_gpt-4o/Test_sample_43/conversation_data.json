    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the second bird from the left.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. There are three birds: an owl, a crow, and a cardinal.\n2. The crow is to the left of the owl.\n3. The owl is the second from the left.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that the owl is in the middle position. Since the crow is to the left of the owl (statement 2), the crow must be in the first position. This leaves the cardinal to be in the third position.\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: Crow, Owl, Cardinal.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The owl is the second from the left - This is true based on our arrangement.\n(B) The crow is the second from the left - This is false; the crow is the first from the left.\n(C) The cardinal is the second from the left - This is false; the cardinal is the third from the left.\n\nThe correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
