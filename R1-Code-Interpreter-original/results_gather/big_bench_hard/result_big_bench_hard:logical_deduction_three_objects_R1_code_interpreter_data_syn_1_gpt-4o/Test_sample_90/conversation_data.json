    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given information. We know the following:\n\n1. Eli finished last.\n2. Mya finished second.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Eli finished last, he cannot be first or second. Therefore, Eli is third.\n- Mya finished second, so she cannot be first or third. Therefore, Mya is second.\n- This leaves Eve as the only golfer who can be first.\n\nNow, let's match this conclusion with the options provided:\n\n(A) Eli finished first - This is incorrect because Eli finished last.\n(B) Mya finished first - This is incorrect because Mya finished second.\n(C) Eve finished first - This is correct because Eve is the only one left to be first.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C) Eve finished first.\n\n<<<C) Eve finished first>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
