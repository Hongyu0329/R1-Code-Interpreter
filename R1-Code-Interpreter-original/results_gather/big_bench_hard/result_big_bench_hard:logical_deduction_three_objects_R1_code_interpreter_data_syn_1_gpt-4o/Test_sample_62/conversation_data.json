    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The orange book is the leftmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the brown book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the orange book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the brown book, which means the brown book cannot be in the rightmost position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's consider the possible arrangements:\n\n1. Orange, Brown, Gray\n2. Orange, Gray, Brown\n\nIn the first arrangement (Orange, Brown, Gray), the gray book is indeed to the right of the brown book, satisfying both conditions.\n\nIn the second arrangement (Orange, Gray, Brown), the gray book is not to the right of the brown book, which violates the second condition.\n\nTherefore, the only valid arrangement is Orange, Brown, Gray.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is second from the left:\n\n- In the arrangement Orange, Brown, Gray, the brown book is second from the left.\n\nThus, the correct option is (C) The brown book is the second from the left.\n\n<<<C>>>"
