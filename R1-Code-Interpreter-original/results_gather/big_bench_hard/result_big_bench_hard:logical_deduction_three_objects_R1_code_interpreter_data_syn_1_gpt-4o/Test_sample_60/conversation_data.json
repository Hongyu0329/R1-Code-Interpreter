    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age. We have three vehicles: a motorcycle, a minivan, and a tractor. The statements given are:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n2. The minivan is the second-newest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the minivan is not the oldest or the newest; it is in the middle in terms of age. \n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If the minivan is the second-newest, then there must be one vehicle that is newer and one that is older than the minivan.\n- From statement 1, the tractor is newer than the minivan. Therefore, the tractor must be the newest.\n- This leaves the motorcycle as the oldest vehicle.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is: Motorcycle, Minivan, Tractor.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The motorcycle is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the motorcycle is the oldest.\n- (B) The minivan is the second-newest: This is correct as per the given statements.\n- (C) The tractor is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the tractor is the newest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
