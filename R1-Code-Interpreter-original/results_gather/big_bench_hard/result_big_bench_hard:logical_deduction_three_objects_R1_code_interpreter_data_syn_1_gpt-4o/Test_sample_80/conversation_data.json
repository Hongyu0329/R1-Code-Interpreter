    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We are given the following information:\n\n1. Mangoes are the cheapest.\n2. Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\nWe need to identify which of the given options correctly describes the cheapest fruit.\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n\n- Since mangoes are the cheapest, they must be the first in the order of increasing price.\n- Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive, which means they are in the middle position.\n- Therefore, watermelons must be the most expensive.\n\nGiven this order:\n1. Mangoes (cheapest)\n2. Cantaloupes (second-most expensive)\n3. Watermelons (most expensive)\n\nNow, let's match this with the options provided:\n\n- Option (A) states that cantaloupes are the cheapest, which contradicts the given information.\n- Option (B) states that watermelons are the cheapest, which also contradicts the given information.\n- Option (C) states that mangoes are the cheapest, which is consistent with the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
