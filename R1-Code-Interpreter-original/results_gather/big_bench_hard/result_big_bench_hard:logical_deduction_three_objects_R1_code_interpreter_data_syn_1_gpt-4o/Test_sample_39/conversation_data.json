    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements and then match it with the options provided.\n\n1. We have three books: a brown book, a yellow book, and an orange book.\n2. The yellow book is the leftmost.\n3. The orange book is to the right of the brown book.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the yellow book is the first book on the left. This rules out option (A) and option (C) because they suggest that either the brown or the orange book is the leftmost.\n\nFrom statement 3, the orange book is to the right of the brown book. This means the brown book must be to the left of the orange book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order of the books is:\n- Yellow book (leftmost)\n- Brown book\n- Orange book (rightmost)\n\nThis order confirms that the yellow book is indeed the leftmost, which matches option (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
