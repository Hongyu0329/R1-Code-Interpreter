On a shelf, there are three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a red book. The blue book is the rightmost. The orange book is the leftmost.\nOptions:\n(A) The blue book is the second from the left\n(B) The orange book is the second from the left\n(C) The red book is the second from the left\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is the rightmost.\n2. The orange book is the leftmost.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since the orange book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- Since the blue book is the rightmost, it must be in the third position.\n- This leaves the second position for the red book.\n\nTherefore, the order of the books from left to right is: Orange, Red, Blue.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The blue book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the blue book is the rightmost.\n(B) The orange book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the orange book is the leftmost.\n(C) The red book is the second from the left - This is correct because the red book is indeed in the second position.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
