    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: watermelons, apples, and mangoes. The given conditions are:\n\n1. Apples are less expensive than mangoes.\n2. Mangoes are less expensive than watermelons.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following order in terms of increasing price:\n\n- Apples < Mangoes < Watermelons\n\nThis means that apples are the least expensive, mangoes are more expensive than apples but less expensive than watermelons, and watermelons are the most expensive.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The watermelons are the second-most expensive: This is incorrect because watermelons are the most expensive.\n\n(B) The apples are the second-most expensive: This is incorrect because apples are the least expensive.\n\n(C) The mangoes are the second-most expensive: This is correct because mangoes are more expensive than apples but less expensive than watermelons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
