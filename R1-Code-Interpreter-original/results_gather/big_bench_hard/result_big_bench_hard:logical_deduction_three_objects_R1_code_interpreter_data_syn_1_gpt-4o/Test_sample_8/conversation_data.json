    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct position of each book based on the given statements and then match it with the options provided.\n\n1. We have three books: orange, yellow, and blue.\n2. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n3. The orange book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze the positions:\n\n- Since the orange book is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n- The blue book is to the right of the yellow book, which means the yellow book must be to the left of the blue book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement is:\n- Yellow book on the left\n- Orange book in the middle\n- Blue book on the right\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options:\n\n- (A) The orange book is the second from the left: This matches our arrangement.\n- (B) The yellow book is the second from the left: This does not match.\n- (C) The blue book is the second from the left: This does not match.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
