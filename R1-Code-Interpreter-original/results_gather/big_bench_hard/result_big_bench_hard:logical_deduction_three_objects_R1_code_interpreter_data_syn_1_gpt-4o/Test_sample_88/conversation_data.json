    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: loquats, watermelons, and cantaloupes. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the watermelons are the second-most expensive, they cannot be the cheapest. This rules out option (B).\n- The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes, which means the cantaloupes cannot be more expensive than the loquats.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's consider the possible orderings:\n\n1. Loquats > Watermelons > Cantaloupes\n2. Watermelons > Loquats > Cantaloupes\n\nHowever, the second ordering is not possible because the watermelons are the second-most expensive, not the most expensive. Therefore, the only valid ordering is:\n\n- Loquats (most expensive)\n- Watermelons (second-most expensive)\n- Cantaloupes (cheapest)\n\nThus, the cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
