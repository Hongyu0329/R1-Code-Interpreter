    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the prices of the three fruits: watermelons, apples, and mangoes, based on the given statements.\n\n1. The apples are less expensive than the mangoes.\n   - This implies: Apples < Mangoes\n\n2. The mangoes are less expensive than the watermelons.\n   - This implies: Mangoes < Watermelons\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices:\n- Apples < Mangoes < Watermelons\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The watermelons are the cheapest.\n   - This is incorrect because, according to the order, watermelons are the most expensive.\n\n(B) The apples are the cheapest.\n   - This is correct because apples are the least expensive in the order.\n\n(C) The mangoes are the cheapest.\n   - This is incorrect because mangoes are more expensive than apples.\n\nBased on the logical deductions, the correct answer is that the apples are the cheapest.\n\n<<<B) The apples are the cheapest>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
