    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: oranges, mangoes, and plums. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.\n2. The oranges are less expensive than the plums.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the price of plums is less than the price of mangoes. This can be represented as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Price of Plums} < \\text{Price of Mangoes}\n  \\]\n\n- From statement 2, we know that the price of oranges is less than the price of plums. This can be represented as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Price of Oranges} < \\text{Price of Plums}\n  \\]\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Price of Oranges} < \\text{Price of Plums} < \\text{Price of Mangoes}\n\\]\n\nFrom this combined inequality, it is clear that the oranges are the cheapest among the three fruits.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The oranges are the cheapest.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
