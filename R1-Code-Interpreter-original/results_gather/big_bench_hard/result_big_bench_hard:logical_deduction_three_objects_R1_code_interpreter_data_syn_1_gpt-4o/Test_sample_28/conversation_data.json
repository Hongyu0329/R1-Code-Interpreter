    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the positions of the three birds: the hummingbird, the blue jay, and the raven, based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, it cannot be the leftmost or the rightmost bird. Therefore, the raven must be in the middle position.\n- Given that the blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird, the hummingbird cannot be the rightmost bird.\n\nNow, let's arrange the birds based on these conditions:\n\n1. The leftmost position can only be occupied by the hummingbird or the blue jay.\n2. The middle position is occupied by the raven.\n3. The rightmost position is occupied by the blue jay, as it is to the right of the hummingbird.\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n- Leftmost: Hummingbird\n- Middle: Raven\n- Rightmost: Blue Jay\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The blue jay is the rightmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
