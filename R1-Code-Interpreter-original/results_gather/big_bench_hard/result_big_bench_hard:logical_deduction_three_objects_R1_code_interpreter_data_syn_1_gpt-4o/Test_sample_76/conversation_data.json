    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Eve finished below Eli.\n2. Eve finished above Mya.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Eli finished above Eve. This means Eli is not last.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Eve finished above Mya. This means Mya is last.\n\nGiven these two statements, the order of finishing from first to last is:\n\n1. Eli\n2. Eve\n3. Mya\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) Eli finished last: This is incorrect because Eli finished first.\n- (B) Mya finished last: This is correct because Mya finished last.\n- (C) Eve finished last: This is incorrect because Eve finished second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
