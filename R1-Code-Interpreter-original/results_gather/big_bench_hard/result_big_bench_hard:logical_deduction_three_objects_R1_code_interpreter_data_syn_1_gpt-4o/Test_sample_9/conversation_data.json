    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan, and the truck, based on the given statements.\n\n1. The minivan is newer than the truck.\n   - This implies that the minivan is not the oldest, and the truck is not the newest.\n\n2. The station wagon is newer than the minivan.\n   - This implies that the station wagon is not the oldest, and the minivan is not the newest.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order in terms of age (from oldest to newest):\n- Truck (oldest)\n- Minivan\n- Station Wagon (newest)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- (A) The station wagon is the newest: This is consistent with our deduction.\n- (B) The minivan is the newest: This contradicts our deduction.\n- (C) The truck is the newest: This contradicts our deduction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
