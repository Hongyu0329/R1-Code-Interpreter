    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which option correctly describes the position of the birds.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. There are three birds: a hawk, a crow, and a raven.\n2. The raven is to the right of the hawk.\n3. The crow is the rightmost.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that the crow is at the far right position. This leaves two positions to the left of the crow for the hawk and the raven.\n\nFrom statement 2, the raven is to the right of the hawk. Therefore, the hawk must be in the leftmost position, and the raven must be in the middle position.\n\nSo, the order from left to right is: Hawk, Raven, Crow.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The hawk is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the hawk is the leftmost.\n(B) The crow is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the crow is the rightmost.\n(C) The raven is the second from the left - This is correct because the raven is in the middle position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
