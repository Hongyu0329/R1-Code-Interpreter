    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given statements:\n\n1. The red book is the rightmost.\n2. The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the red book is at the far right position.\n- From statement 2, the blue book must be positioned to the right of the green book.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement of the books is:\n\n- Green book\n- Blue book\n- Red book\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options provided:\n\n(A) The green book is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the red book is the rightmost.\n(B) The red book is the rightmost - This is correct as per the given statements.\n(C) The blue book is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the red book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
