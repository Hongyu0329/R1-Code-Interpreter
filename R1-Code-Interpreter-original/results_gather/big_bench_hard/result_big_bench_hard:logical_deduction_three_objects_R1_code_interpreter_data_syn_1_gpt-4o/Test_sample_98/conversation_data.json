    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The robin is to the right of the crow.\n2. The robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the crow is to the left of the robin.\n- From statement 2, we know that the robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nBased on these two statements, the order from left to right must be: Crow, Robin, Blue Jay.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The robin is the second from the left: This is consistent with our order (Crow, Robin, Blue Jay), as the robin is indeed second from the left.\n\n(B) The blue jay is the second from the left: This is not consistent with our order, as the blue jay is third from the left.\n\n(C) The crow is the second from the left: This is not consistent with our order, as the crow is first from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
