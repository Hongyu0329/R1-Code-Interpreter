    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age, given the statements:\n\n1. The convertible is older than the tractor.\n2. The hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- If the hatchback is the second-newest, it means there is one vehicle newer than it and one vehicle older than it.\n- The convertible is older than the tractor, which means the tractor is newer than the convertible.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's consider the possible orderings:\n\n1. Convertible, Hatchback, Tractor\n   - Convertible is older than the tractor.\n   - Hatchback is the second-newest.\n\n2. Hatchback, Convertible, Tractor\n   - Convertible is older than the tractor.\n   - Hatchback is the second-newest.\n\n3. Convertible, Tractor, Hatchback\n   - Convertible is older than the tractor.\n   - Hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only consistent ordering with the given statements is:\n\n- Convertible, Hatchback, Tractor\n\nThis means the hatchback is indeed the second-newest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(A) The hatchback is the second-newest\n\n<<<A>>>"
