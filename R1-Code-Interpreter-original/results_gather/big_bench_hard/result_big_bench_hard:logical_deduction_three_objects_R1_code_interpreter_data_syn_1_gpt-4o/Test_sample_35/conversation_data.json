    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the bus, the sedan, and the truck. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The truck is older than the bus.\n2. The bus is older than the sedan.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order of ages from oldest to newest:\n\n- Truck (oldest)\n- Bus\n- Sedan (newest)\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the second-newest. Based on the order above, the bus is the second-newest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The bus is the second-newest.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
