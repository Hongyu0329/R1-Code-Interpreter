    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The tractor is the second-newest.\n2. The minivan is newer than the convertible.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the tractor is the second-newest, it cannot be the newest or the oldest. Therefore, it must be in the middle position.\n- The minivan is newer than the convertible, which means the minivan cannot be the oldest. Therefore, the minivan must be either the newest or the second-newest.\n\nGiven that the tractor is already the second-newest, the minivan must be the newest. This leaves the convertible as the oldest.\n\nThus, the order from newest to oldest is:\n1. Minivan (newest)\n2. Tractor (second-newest)\n3. Convertible (oldest)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The tractor is the second-newest: This is consistent with our analysis.\n- (B) The convertible is the second-newest: This is not consistent, as the convertible is the oldest.\n- (C) The minivan is the second-newest: This is not consistent, as the minivan is the newest.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
