    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\n2. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, it occupies the middle position.\n- The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird, meaning the hummingbird must be to the left of the blue jay.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's consider the possible arrangements:\n\n1. Hummingbird, Raven, Blue Jay\n2. Raven, Hummingbird, Blue Jay\n3. Hummingbird, Blue Jay, Raven\n\nSince the raven is the second from the left, the only valid arrangement is:\n\n- Hummingbird, Raven, Blue Jay\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The hummingbird is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the raven is the second from the left.\n- (B) The blue jay is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the raven is the second from the left.\n- (C) The raven is the second from the left: This is correct as it matches the given condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
