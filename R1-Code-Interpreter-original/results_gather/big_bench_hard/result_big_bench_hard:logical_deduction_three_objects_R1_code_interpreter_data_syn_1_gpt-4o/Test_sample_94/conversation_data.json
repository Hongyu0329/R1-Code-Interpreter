    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given statements:\n\n1. The orange book is to the left of the white book.\n2. The purple book is the rightmost.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the purple book is the rightmost, it must be at the far right position on the shelf.\n- The orange book is to the left of the white book, which means the orange book cannot be the rightmost. Therefore, the orange book must be to the left of both the white and purple books.\n- Given that the purple book is the rightmost, the only possible order that satisfies both conditions is: Orange book, White book, Purple book.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The orange book is the leftmost: This is consistent with our determined order.\n(B) The white book is the leftmost: This is not possible because the orange book is to the left of the white book.\n(C) The purple book is the leftmost: This contradicts the statement that the purple book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
