    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the cheapest.\n\n1. We have three fruits: apples, peaches, and mangoes.\n2. The mangoes are less expensive than the peaches. This means:\n   - Mangoes < Peaches\n3. The apples are less expensive than the mangoes. This means:\n   - Apples < Mangoes\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices:\n- Apples < Mangoes < Peaches\n\nGiven this order, the apples are the least expensive of the three fruits.\n\nNow, let's match this conclusion with the provided options:\n- (A) The apples are the cheapest: This matches our conclusion.\n- (B) The peaches are the cheapest: This contradicts our conclusion.\n- (C) The mangoes are the cheapest: This also contradicts our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
