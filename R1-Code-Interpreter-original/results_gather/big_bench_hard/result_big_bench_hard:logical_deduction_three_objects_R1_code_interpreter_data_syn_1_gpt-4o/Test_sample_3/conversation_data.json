    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The robin is to the right of the crow.\n2. The robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that the crow is to the left of the robin. So, the order could be: Crow, Robin, ...\n- From statement 2, we know that the robin is to the left of the blue jay. So, the order could be: ..., Robin, Blue Jay.\n\nCombining both statements, we can deduce the complete order of the birds on the branch:\n\n- Crow, Robin, Blue Jay\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is the rightmost:\n\n- In the order Crow, Robin, Blue Jay, the Blue Jay is the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The blue jay is the rightmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
