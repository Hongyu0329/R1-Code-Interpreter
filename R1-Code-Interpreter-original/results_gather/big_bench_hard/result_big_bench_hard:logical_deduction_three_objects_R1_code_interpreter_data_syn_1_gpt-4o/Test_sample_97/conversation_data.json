    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices. We have three fruits: cantaloupes, oranges, and watermelons. The statements given are:\n\n1. Oranges are the most expensive.\n2. Cantaloupes are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since oranges are the most expensive, they are at the top of the price list.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than watermelons, which means cantaloupes are priced higher than watermelons.\n\nGiven these two conditions, the order of the fruits from most expensive to least expensive is:\n\n1. Oranges\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Watermelons\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. Based on the order above, cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
