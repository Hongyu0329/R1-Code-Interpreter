On a branch, there are three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\nOptions:\n(A) The blue jay is the second from the left\n(B) The quail is the second from the left\n(C) The falcon is the second from the left\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\nLet's denote the positions on the branch from left to right as Position 1, Position 2, and Position 3.\n\nFrom the conditions:\n- The falcon is to the right of the blue jay, so the falcon cannot be in Position 1.\n- The blue jay is to the right of the quail, so the blue jay cannot be in Position 1.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's deduce the possible positions for each bird:\n\n- The quail must be in Position 1 because it is to the left of the blue jay.\n- The blue jay must be in Position 2 because it is to the right of the quail and to the left of the falcon.\n- The falcon must be in Position 3 because it is to the right of the blue jay.\n\nNow, let's match this arrangement with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The blue jay is the second from the left: This matches our arrangement.\n- (B) The quail is the second from the left: This does not match our arrangement.\n- (C) The falcon is the second from the left: This does not match our arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
