    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is to the left of the red book.\n2. The gray book is to the left of the purple book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- If the purple book is to the left of the red book, then the order cannot be red, purple.\n- If the gray book is to the left of the purple book, then the order cannot be purple, gray.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order of the books from left to right is:\n\n- Gray book\n- Purple book\n- Red book\n\nTherefore, the gray book is the leftmost book on the shelf.\n\nNow, let's match this conclusion with the provided options:\n\n(A) The gray book is the leftmost\n(B) The purple book is the leftmost\n(C) The red book is the leftmost\n\nThe correct option is (A) because the gray book is indeed the leftmost.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order.
