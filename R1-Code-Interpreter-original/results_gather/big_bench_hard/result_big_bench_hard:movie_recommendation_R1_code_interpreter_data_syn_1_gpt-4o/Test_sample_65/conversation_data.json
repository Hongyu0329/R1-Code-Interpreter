    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the common theme or genre among the given movies: \"The Terminator,\" \"Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope.\" \n\n1. **The Terminator**: This is a science fiction action film involving time travel and a dystopian future.\n2. **Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi**: This is a science fiction space opera with elements of adventure and fantasy.\n3. **Forrest Gump**: This is a drama with elements of romance and historical fiction, but it is not primarily science fiction.\n4. **Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope**: Like Episode VI, this is a science fiction space opera with adventure and fantasy elements.\n\nThe common theme among most of these movies (except \"Forrest Gump\") is science fiction, with a focus on action and adventure. \n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **(A) Independence Day**: This is a science fiction action film about an alien invasion, which aligns well with the science fiction theme.\n- **(B) The Human Condition III**: This is a Japanese epic war drama film, not related to science fiction.\n- **(C) The Lifeguard**: This is a drama film, not related to science fiction.\n- **(D) Secretary**: This is a romantic drama film, not related to science fiction.\n\nBased on the analysis, \"Independence Day\" is the movie that shares the most similarities with the science fiction and action themes present in \"The Terminator\" and the \"Star Wars\" films.\n\nTherefore, the movie similar to \"The Terminator,\" \"Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,\" and \"Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope\" is:\n\n<<<A) Independence Day>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to The Terminator, Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Forrest Gump, Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope:\nOptions:\n(A) Independence Day\n(B) The Human Condition III\n(C) The Lifeguard\n(D) Secretary\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
