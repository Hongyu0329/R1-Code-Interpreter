    "To find a movie similar to \"Léon: The Professional,\" \"The Matrix,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"Pulp Fiction,\" we need to identify the common themes or genres among these films. \n\n1. **Léon: The Professional** - This is a crime thriller with action elements, focusing on a hitman and his relationship with a young girl.\n2. **The Matrix** - A science fiction action film with themes of reality, technology, and rebellion.\n3. **Forrest Gump** - A drama with elements of romance and comedy, following the life of a man with a unique perspective on historical events.\n4. **Pulp Fiction** - A crime film with a non-linear narrative, known for its dialogue and intertwining storylines.\n\nThe common elements among these films are action, crime, and drama, with some having a unique narrative style or thematic depth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **Romper Stomper** - A drama film about a group of skinheads in Melbourne, Australia. It has themes of violence and social issues, which align with the crime and drama aspects.\n\n(B) **Fame** - A musical drama about students at a performing arts high school. This doesn't align with the action or crime elements.\n\n(C) **Up** - An animated adventure film with themes of friendship and adventure. It doesn't fit the crime or action genre.\n\n(D) **The Browning Version** - A drama about a teacher's life and career. It lacks the action and crime elements.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"Romper Stomper\" is the most similar to the films listed, as it shares the crime and drama elements.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our reasoning aligns with the genres and themes.\n\n```python\n# Define the genres and themes of the given movies\nmovies = {\n    \"Léon: The Professional\": [\"crime\", \"thriller\", \"action\"],\n    \"The Matrix\": [\"science fiction\", \"action\"],\n    \"Forrest Gump\": [\"drama\", \"romance\", \"comedy\"],\n    \"Pulp Fiction\": [\"crime\", \"drama\", \"non-linear narrative\"]\n}\n\n# Define the genres and themes of the options\noptions = {\n    \"Romper Stomper\": [\"drama\", \"crime\", \"social issues\"],\n    \"Fame\": [\"musical\", \"drama\"],\n    \"Up\": [\"animated\", \"adventure\", \"friendship\"],\n    \"The Browning Version\": [\"drama\"]\n}\n\n# Function to find the most similar movie\ndef find_similar_movie(movies, options):\n    # Calculate similarity based on common genres/themes\n    similarity_scores = {}\n    for option, option_genres in options.items():\n        score = 0\n        for movie_genres in movies.values():\n            score += len(set(option_genres) & set(movie_genres))\n        similarity_scores[option] = score\n    # Find the option with the highest similarity score\n    most_similar = max(similarity_scores, key=similarity_scores.get)\n    return most_similar\n\n# Find and print the most similar movie\nmost_similar_movie = find_similar_movie(movies, options)\nprint(most_similar_movie)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the most similar movie based on the genres and themes.",
    "The code execution confirms that \"Romper Stomper\" is the most similar movie to \"Léon: The Professional,\" \"The Matrix,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" based on the shared themes of crime and drama.\n\n<<<Romper Stomper>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to Léon The Professional, The Matrix, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction:\nOptions:\n(A) Romper Stomper\n(B) Fame\n(C) Up\n(D) The Browning Version\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
