    "To find a movie similar to \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" and \"Dead Man Walking,\" we need to identify common themes, genres, or elements among these films. Let's analyze each movie:\n\n1. **Terminator 2: Judgment Day** - This is a science fiction action film with themes of time travel, artificial intelligence, and a fight for survival.\n\n2. **The Fugitive** - This is a thriller with themes of crime, justice, and a man on the run trying to prove his innocence.\n\n3. **The Shawshank Redemption** - This is a drama with themes of hope, friendship, and redemption, set in a prison environment.\n\n4. **Dead Man Walking** - This is a drama that deals with themes of crime, punishment, and moral redemption, focusing on the relationship between a death row inmate and a nun.\n\nCommon elements among these films include themes of justice, redemption, and survival, often with a dramatic or action-oriented narrative.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) **Walk** - Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the genre or themes.\n\n(B) **Don't Run** - Again, without context, it's hard to assess.\n\n(C) **Shaun the Sheep Movie** - This is an animated family film, which doesn't align with the themes of the other movies.\n\n(D) **Rocky IV** - This is a sports drama with themes of perseverance, rivalry, and overcoming challenges, which somewhat aligns with the themes of survival and redemption.\n\n(E) **Braveheart** - This is a historical drama with themes of freedom, justice, and heroism, which aligns well with the themes of justice and survival.\n\nBased on the analysis, \"Braveheart\" shares the most thematic similarities with the given movies, particularly in terms of justice, survival, and dramatic narrative.\n\nLet's confirm this choice by writing a simple Python script to check the genres and themes of the options if needed. However, based on the reasoning, we can conclude:\n\n<<<Braveheart>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to Terminator 2 Judgment Day, The Fugitive, The Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking:\nOptions:\n(A) Walk\n(B) Don't Run\n(C) Shaun the Sheep Movie\n(D) Rocky IV\n(E) Braveheart\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
