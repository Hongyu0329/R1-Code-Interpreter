    "To find a movie similar to \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Apollo 13,\" \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" and \"Dead Man Walking,\" we need to identify common themes or genres among these films. Let's break down the characteristics of each movie:\n\n1. **The Shawshank Redemption**: This is a drama about hope, friendship, and redemption set in a prison.\n2. **Apollo 13**: A historical drama and thriller about a space mission that faces life-threatening challenges.\n3. **Terminator 2: Judgment Day**: A science fiction action film with themes of survival and the fight against a powerful enemy.\n4. **Dead Man Walking**: A drama that deals with themes of crime, punishment, and redemption.\n\nCommon themes among these movies include drama, intense situations, and elements of redemption or survival. Now, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) **Frankenstein Unbound**: A science fiction film that combines elements of horror and time travel.\n(B) **Jon Stewart Has Left the Building**: This seems to be a comedy or documentary, likely not fitting the drama or intense themes.\n(C) **Clear and Present Danger**: A political action thriller involving espionage and military operations.\n(D) **Little Giants**: A family sports comedy about a youth football team.\n\nBased on the analysis, \"Clear and Present Danger\" (Option C) is the most similar to the given movies. It is a drama/thriller with intense situations, aligning with the themes of survival and action seen in \"Apollo 13\" and \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\"\n\nLet's confirm this choice by checking the genres and themes of the options using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define a dictionary with movie options and their genres/themes\nmovies = {\n    \"Frankenstein Unbound\": [\"Science Fiction\", \"Horror\", \"Time Travel\"],\n    \"Jon Stewart Has Left the Building\": [\"Comedy\", \"Documentary\"],\n    \"Clear and Present Danger\": [\"Action\", \"Thriller\", \"Drama\", \"Espionage\"],\n    \"Little Giants\": [\"Family\", \"Sports\", \"Comedy\"]\n}\n\n# Define the target themes based on the given movies\ntarget_themes = [\"Drama\", \"Thriller\", \"Action\", \"Survival\", \"Redemption\"]\n\n# Function to find the most similar movie based on matching themes\ndef find_similar_movie(movies, target_themes):\n    max_matches = 0\n    similar_movie = None\n    for movie, themes in movies.items():\n        matches = len(set(themes) & set(target_themes))\n        if matches > max_matches:\n            max_matches = matches\n            similar_movie = movie\n    return similar_movie\n\n# Find and print the most similar movie\nsimilar_movie = find_similar_movie(movies, target_themes)\nprint(similar_movie)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the most similar movie based on the themes.",
    "Based on the analysis and the code execution, the movie \"Clear and Present Danger\" is the most similar to \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Apollo 13,\" \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" and \"Dead Man Walking.\" It shares themes of drama, thriller, and action, which align with the intense and survival-oriented nature of the given films.\n\n<<<Clear and Present Danger>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to The Shawshank Redemption, Apollo 13, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, Dead Man Walking:\nOptions:\n(A) Frankenstein Unbound\n(B) Jon Stewart Has Left the Building\n(C) Clear and Present Danger\n(D) Little Giants\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
