    "To find a movie similar to \"Jurassic Park,\" \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" \"Batman,\" and \"American Beauty,\" we need to identify common themes or genres among these films. Here's a brief analysis of each:\n\n1. **Jurassic Park**: This is a science fiction adventure film with elements of thriller and action.\n2. **The Silence of the Lambs**: This is a psychological horror thriller.\n3. **Batman**: This is a superhero film with action and thriller elements.\n4. **American Beauty**: This is a drama with dark comedy and psychological elements.\n\nCommon elements among these films include thriller, psychological aspects, and some level of action or drama. Now, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Night of the Living Dead**: This is a horror film with thriller elements.\n- **Forrest Gump**: This is a drama with elements of romance and comedy.\n- **Ghost Ship**: This is a horror film with thriller elements.\n- **Revenge for Jolly!**: This is a comedy-drama.\n\nBased on the analysis, \"Night of the Living Dead\" and \"Ghost Ship\" both have thriller elements, but \"Ghost Ship\" also includes psychological horror, which aligns more closely with the psychological and thriller aspects of the given movies.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to check the genres of these movies and find the closest match.\n\n```python\n# Define the genres of the given movies\nmovies_genres = {\n    \"Jurassic Park\": [\"Science Fiction\", \"Adventure\", \"Thriller\", \"Action\"],\n    \"The Silence of the Lambs\": [\"Psychological Horror\", \"Thriller\"],\n    \"Batman\": [\"Superhero\", \"Action\", \"Thriller\"],\n    \"American Beauty\": [\"Drama\", \"Dark Comedy\", \"Psychological\"],\n}\n\n# Define the genres of the options\noptions_genres = {\n    \"Night of the Living Dead\": [\"Horror\", \"Thriller\"],\n    \"Forrest Gump\": [\"Drama\", \"Romance\", \"Comedy\"],\n    \"Ghost Ship\": [\"Horror\", \"Thriller\", \"Psychological\"],\n    \"Revenge for Jolly!\": [\"Comedy\", \"Drama\"],\n}\n\n# Function to calculate similarity based on common genres\ndef calculate_similarity(movie_genres, option_genres):\n    return len(set(movie_genres) & set(option_genres))\n\n# Calculate similarity for each option\nsimilarity_scores = {option: 0 for option in options_genres}\nfor movie, genres in movies_genres.items():\n    for option, option_genres in options_genres.items():\n        similarity_scores[option] += calculate_similarity(genres, option_genres)\n\n# Find the option with the highest similarity score\nmost_similar_movie = max(similarity_scores, key=similarity_scores.get)\nprint(most_similar_movie)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the most similar movie.",
    "Based on the analysis and the code execution, the movie \"Ghost Ship\" is the most similar to the given movies \"Jurassic Park,\" \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" \"Batman,\" and \"American Beauty.\" This is because \"Ghost Ship\" shares the thriller and psychological elements that are common among the given movies.\n\n<<<Ghost Ship>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to Jurassic Park, The Silence of the Lambs, Batman, American Beauty:\nOptions:\n(A) Night of the Living Dead\n(B) Forrest Gump\n(C) Ghost Ship\n(D) Revenge for Jolly!\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
