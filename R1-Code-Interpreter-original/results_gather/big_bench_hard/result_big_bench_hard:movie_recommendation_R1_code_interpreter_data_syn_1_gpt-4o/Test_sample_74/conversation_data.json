    "To find a movie similar to \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" \"Dances with Wolves,\" and \"The Fugitive,\" we need to consider the themes, genres, and styles of these films. \n\n1. **The Shawshank Redemption**: This is a drama about hope, friendship, and redemption set in a prison.\n2. **Forrest Gump**: A drama-comedy that follows the life of a man with a low IQ who witnesses and unwittingly influences several historical events.\n3. **Dances with Wolves**: A historical drama about a Union Army officer who befriends a group of Lakota Indians.\n4. **The Fugitive**: A thriller about a man wrongfully accused of murder who escapes and seeks to prove his innocence.\n\nCommon themes among these movies include drama, strong character development, and a focus on personal growth or redemption. \n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **(A) Pulp Fiction**: A crime film with a non-linear storyline, known for its unique style and dialogue.\n- **(B) The Girl on the Bridge**: A French romantic drama about a suicidal woman and a knife thrower.\n- **(C) Radioland Murders**: A comedy-mystery set in the 1930s about a series of murders at a radio station.\n- **(D) Father of the Bride**: A comedy about a father dealing with his daughter's upcoming wedding.\n\nConsidering the themes and genres, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a crime film and doesn't align with the drama and personal growth themes. \"The Girl on the Bridge\" is a romantic drama, which is closer in genre but not in theme. \"Radioland Murders\" is a comedy-mystery, which doesn't fit the drama theme. \"Father of the Bride\" is a comedy, which also doesn't fit the drama and personal growth themes.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the themes of the given movies, but \"The Girl on the Bridge\" is the closest in terms of being a drama with a focus on personal relationships, even though it is a romantic drama.\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<B) The Girl on the Bridge>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to The Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Dances with Wolves, The Fugitive:\nOptions:\n(A) Pulp Fiction\n(B) The Girl on the Bridge\n(C) Radioland Murders\n(D) Father of the Bride\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
