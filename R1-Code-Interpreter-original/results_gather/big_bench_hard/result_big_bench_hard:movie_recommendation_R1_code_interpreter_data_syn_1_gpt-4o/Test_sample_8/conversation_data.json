    "To find a movie similar to \"Jurassic Park,\" \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" \"Schindler's List,\" and \"Braveheart,\" we need to identify the common themes or genres among these films. Here's a brief analysis of each:\n\n1. **Jurassic Park**: This is a science fiction adventure film with elements of thriller and action.\n2. **The Silence of the Lambs**: This is a psychological horror thriller.\n3. **Schindler's List**: This is a historical drama film.\n4. **Braveheart**: This is an epic historical war film.\n\nCommon elements among these films include drama, historical context, and elements of thriller or intense storytelling. Now, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **A Hard Day's Night**: This is a musical comedy film about The Beatles.\n- **Showtime**: This is a comedy film about a reality TV show.\n- **Forrest Gump**: This is a drama film with historical elements, following the life of a man through several decades of American history.\n- **Eddie the Eagle**: This is a biographical sports comedy-drama film.\n\nBased on the analysis, \"Forrest Gump\" is the most similar to the given films. It shares the drama and historical elements, and it has an epic storytelling style that aligns with the other films.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to check the genres of these movies and see which one aligns best with the given films.\n\n```python\n# Define the genres for each movie\nmovies = {\n    \"Jurassic Park\": [\"Science Fiction\", \"Adventure\", \"Thriller\"],\n    \"The Silence of the Lambs\": [\"Psychological Horror\", \"Thriller\"],\n    \"Schindler's List\": [\"Historical\", \"Drama\"],\n    \"Braveheart\": [\"Historical\", \"War\", \"Drama\"],\n    \"A Hard Day's Night\": [\"Musical\", \"Comedy\"],\n    \"Showtime\": [\"Comedy\"],\n    \"Forrest Gump\": [\"Drama\", \"Historical\"],\n    \"Eddie the Eagle\": [\"Biographical\", \"Sports\", \"Comedy\", \"Drama\"]\n}\n\n# Define the target genres based on the given movies\ntarget_genres = [\"Drama\", \"Historical\", \"Thriller\"]\n\n# Function to calculate similarity based on genre overlap\ndef calculate_similarity(movie_genres, target_genres):\n    return len(set(movie_genres) & set(target_genres))\n\n# Calculate similarity for each option\nsimilarities = {movie: calculate_similarity(genres, target_genres) for movie, genres in movies.items()}\n\n# Find the movie with the highest similarity\nmost_similar_movie = max(similarities, key=similarities.get)\n\nprint(most_similar_movie)\n```\n\nThe code will determine which movie from the options is most similar to the given films based on genre overlap. Let's execute it to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that \"Schindler's List\" is the most similar movie based on the genre overlap. However, \"Schindler's List\" is one of the given movies, not one of the options. Let's correct the approach to ensure we only consider the options provided.\n\nThe options are:\n- A Hard Day's Night\n- Showtime\n- Forrest Gump\n- Eddie the Eagle\n\nWe need to find the most similar movie from these options to the given set of movies. Based on the analysis and the code execution, \"Forrest Gump\" is the most similar option due to its drama and historical elements.\n\n<<<Forrest Gump>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to Jurassic Park, The Silence of the Lambs, Schindler's List, Braveheart:\nOptions:\n(A) A Hard Day's Night\n(B) Showtime\n(C) Forrest Gump\n(D) Eddie the Eagle\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
