    "To find a movie similar to \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Inception,\" and \"Pulp Fiction,\" we need to identify common themes, genres, or elements among these films. Let's break down the characteristics of each:\n\n1. **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: This is an action-adventure film with elements of historical fiction and a strong, charismatic lead character.\n2. **The Shawshank Redemption**: This is a drama with themes of hope, friendship, and redemption, set in a prison.\n3. **Inception**: This is a science fiction thriller with complex storytelling, involving dreams and a heist.\n4. **Pulp Fiction**: This is a crime film with a non-linear narrative, dark humor, and strong character development.\n\nCommon elements among these films include:\n- Strong storytelling and character development.\n- Elements of adventure, drama, or thriller.\n- Unique or innovative narrative style.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) **Beyond the Poseidon Adventure**: This is a disaster film, which may have elements of adventure but doesn't align well with the other films' storytelling or character depth.\n\n(B) **The Chorus**: This is a drama about a music teacher and his students, focusing on themes of redemption and hope, similar to \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"\n\n(C) **Forrest Gump**: This is a drama with elements of adventure and a strong narrative, following the life of a unique character through historical events. It shares storytelling depth and character focus with the listed films.\n\n(D) **Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse**: This is a comedy horror film, which doesn't align well with the narrative style or themes of the other films.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"Forrest Gump\" (Option C) seems to be the most similar to the given films due to its strong narrative, character development, and elements of drama and adventure.\n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to ensure our choice aligns with the characteristics of the given films.\n\n```python\n# Define the characteristics of the given films\nfilms = {\n    \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\": [\"action\", \"adventure\", \"historical\", \"strong lead\"],\n    \"The Shawshank Redemption\": [\"drama\", \"hope\", \"friendship\", \"redemption\"],\n    \"Inception\": [\"sci-fi\", \"thriller\", \"complex\", \"heist\"],\n    \"Pulp Fiction\": [\"crime\", \"non-linear\", \"dark humor\", \"character development\"]\n}\n\n# Define the characteristics of the options\noptions = {\n    \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\": [\"disaster\", \"adventure\"],\n    \"The Chorus\": [\"drama\", \"redemption\", \"hope\"],\n    \"Forrest Gump\": [\"drama\", \"adventure\", \"historical\", \"strong narrative\"],\n    \"Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse\": [\"comedy\", \"horror\"]\n}\n\n# Function to find the most similar movie\ndef find_similar_movie(films, options):\n    # Calculate similarity based on common characteristics\n    similarity_scores = {}\n    for option, characteristics in options.items():\n        score = 0\n        for film, film_characteristics in films.items():\n            score += len(set(characteristics) & set(film_characteristics))\n        similarity_scores[option] = score\n    # Find the option with the highest similarity score\n    most_similar = max(similarity_scores, key=similarity_scores.get)\n    return most_similar\n\n# Find and print the most similar movie\nmost_similar_movie = find_similar_movie(films, options)\nprint(most_similar_movie)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the most similar movie based on the characteristics.",
    "The code output indicates that \"The Chorus\" is the most similar movie based on the characteristics defined. However, upon reviewing the thematic and narrative elements, \"Forrest Gump\" seems to align more closely with the storytelling depth and character focus of the given films. \n\nThe discrepancy might arise from the way characteristics were weighted or defined in the code. \"The Chorus\" shares themes of redemption and hope with \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" but \"Forrest Gump\" encompasses a broader range of elements, including drama, adventure, and a strong narrative, which are more representative of the collective characteristics of the given films.\n\nTherefore, considering the thematic and narrative alignment, the final answer should be:\n\n<<<Forrest Gump>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find a movie similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Shawshank Redemption, Inception, Pulp Fiction:\nOptions:\n(A) Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\n(B) The Chorus\n(C) Forrest Gump\n(D) Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
