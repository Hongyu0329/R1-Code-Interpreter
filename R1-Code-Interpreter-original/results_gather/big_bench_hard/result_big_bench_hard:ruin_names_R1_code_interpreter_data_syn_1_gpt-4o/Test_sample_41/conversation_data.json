    "To determine which of the options is a humorous edit of the movie name \"Jurassic Park,\" we need to analyze each option and see which one creates a pun or a play on words that is typically used for humor.\n\n1. **Jurassic Mark**: This option changes \"Park\" to \"Mark.\" While it rhymes, it doesn't create a humorous or pun-like effect.\n\n2. **Jurassic Pack**: This option changes \"Park\" to \"Pack.\" It could imply a group or collection, but it doesn't create a humorous effect directly related to the original movie name.\n\n3. **Jurassic Pairk**: This option changes \"Park\" to \"Pairk.\" The change is minimal and doesn't create a humorous effect.\n\n4. **Jurassic Pork**: This option changes \"Park\" to \"Pork.\" This creates a pun by replacing \"Park\" with \"Pork,\" which is a type of meat. The humor comes from the unexpected substitution of a word that sounds similar but has a completely different meaning.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (D) \"Jurassic Pork\" is the most humorous edit because it creates a pun by substituting \"Park\" with \"Pork,\" which is unexpected and amusing.\n\n<<<Jurassic Pork>>>"
