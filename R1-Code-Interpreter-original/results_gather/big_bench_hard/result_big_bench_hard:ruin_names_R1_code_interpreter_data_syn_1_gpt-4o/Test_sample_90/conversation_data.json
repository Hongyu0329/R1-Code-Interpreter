    "To determine which option is a humorous edit of the artist or movie name \"en vogue,\" we need to analyze each option and see if it contains a pun or a play on words that makes it humorous.\n\n1. **Option (A) eon vogue**: This option changes \"en\" to \"eon,\" which is a word meaning a long period of time. However, it doesn't create a humorous effect or pun related to the original name.\n\n2. **Option (B) en vogbue**: This option introduces a typo-like change by adding an extra \"b\" in \"vogue.\" It doesn't create a humorous effect or pun.\n\n3. **Option (C) en vfogue**: This option introduces a typo-like change by adding an \"f\" in \"vogue.\" It doesn't create a humorous effect or pun.\n\n4. **Option (D) en rogue**: This option changes \"vogue\" to \"rogue,\" which is a word meaning a dishonest or unprincipled person. This creates a pun because \"rogue\" is a word that sounds similar to \"vogue\" and has a completely different meaning, making it humorous.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (D) \"en rogue\" is the humorous edit of the artist or movie name \"en vogue\" because it creates a pun by replacing \"vogue\" with \"rogue.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
