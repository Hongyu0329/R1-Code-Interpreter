    "To determine which option is a humorous edit of the movie name \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" we need to analyze each option and see if it introduces a humorous twist or pun.\n\n1. **Option (A): \"raiders of the last ark\"** - This changes \"lost\" to \"last,\" which doesn't introduce humor but rather changes the meaning slightly.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"raiders of the lost irk\"** - This changes \"ark\" to \"irk,\" which is a play on words. \"Irk\" means to annoy or irritate, which could be considered humorous as it creates a pun.\n\n3. **Option (C): \"raidems of the lost ark\"** - This changes \"raiders\" to \"raidems,\" which doesn't make much sense and doesn't introduce humor.\n\n4. **Option (D): \"raiuders of the lost ark\"** - This changes \"raiders\" to \"raiuders,\" which seems like a typo and doesn't introduce humor.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) \"raiders of the lost irk\" is the most likely to be a humorous edit due to the pun created by changing \"ark\" to \"irk.\"\n\n<<<raiders of the lost irk>>>"
