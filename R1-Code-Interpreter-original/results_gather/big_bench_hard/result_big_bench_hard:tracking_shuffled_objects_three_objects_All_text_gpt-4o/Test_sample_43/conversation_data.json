    "To determine which ball Bob has at the end of the game, we need to track the sequence of ball swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Yellow ball\n   - Bob: Green ball\n   - Claire: Blue ball\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice gives her yellow ball to Bob and takes Bob's green ball.\n   - New state:\n     - Alice: Green ball\n     - Bob: Yellow ball\n     - Claire: Blue ball\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives her green ball to Claire and takes Claire's blue ball.\n   - New state:\n     - Alice: Blue ball\n     - Bob: Yellow ball\n     - Claire: Green ball\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives her green ball to Bob and takes Bob's yellow ball.\n   - Final state:\n     - Alice: Blue ball\n     - Bob: Green ball\n     - Claire: Yellow ball\n\nAt the end of the game, Bob has the green ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
