    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the balls as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them according to the given sequence of trades. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice has the green ball.\n   - Bob has the black ball.\n   - Claire has the blue ball.\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Bob and Alice swap their balls.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has the black ball.\n     - Bob has the green ball.\n     - Claire still has the blue ball.\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire and Alice swap their balls.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has the blue ball.\n     - Bob still has the green ball.\n     - Claire has the black ball.\n\n4. **Third Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice and Bob swap their balls.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has the green ball.\n     - Bob has the blue ball.\n     - Claire still has the black ball.\n\nAt the end of the game, Bob is holding the blue ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
