    "To determine which book Claire has at the end of the semester, we need to track the movement of the books through each swap. Let's analyze the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Book Ownership:**\n   - Alice has \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n   - Bob has \"Catch-22.\"\n   - Claire has \"Moby Dick.\"\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice and Bob swap their books.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has \"Catch-22.\"\n     - Bob has \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n     - Claire still has \"Moby Dick.\"\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice and Claire swap their books.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has \"Moby Dick.\"\n     - Bob still has \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n     - Claire has \"Catch-22.\"\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob and Claire swap their books.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice still has \"Moby Dick.\"\n     - Bob has \"Catch-22.\"\n     - Claire has \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n\nAt the end of the semester, Claire has \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
