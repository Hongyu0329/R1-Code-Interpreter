    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the balls as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them according to the given sequence of events. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice has the pink ball.\n   - Bob has the yellow ball.\n   - Claire has the white ball.\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire and Bob swap balls.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice still has the pink ball.\n     - Bob now has the white ball (originally Claire's).\n     - Claire now has the yellow ball (originally Bob's).\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice and Bob swap balls.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice now has the white ball (originally Claire's, now Bob's).\n     - Bob now has the pink ball (originally Alice's).\n     - Claire still has the yellow ball.\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire and Bob swap balls again.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice still has the white ball.\n     - Bob now has the yellow ball (originally Claire's).\n     - Claire now has the pink ball (originally Alice's, then Bob's).\n\nAt the end of the game, Alice is holding the white ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
