    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the gifts as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them according to the given sequence of events. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice has a white present.\n   - Bob has a pink ball.\n   - Claire has a black ball.\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice and Claire swap their gifts.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has a black ball (originally Claire's).\n     - Claire has a white present (originally Alice's).\n     - Bob still has a pink ball.\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice and Bob swap their gifts.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has a pink ball (originally Bob's).\n     - Bob has a black ball (originally Claire's, then Alice's).\n     - Claire still has a white present.\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire and Alice swap their gifts.\n   - After the swap:\n     - Alice has a white present (originally hers, then Claire's).\n     - Claire has a pink ball (originally Bob's, then Alice's).\n     - Bob still has a black ball.\n\nAt the end of the event, Claire has the pink ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
