    "To determine which ball Alice has at the end of the game, we need to track the sequence of ball swaps step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice has the brown ball.\n   - Bob has the blue ball.\n   - Claire has the purple ball.\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives her brown ball to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his blue ball to Alice.\n   - **State after first swap:**\n     - Alice has the blue ball.\n     - Bob has the brown ball.\n     - Claire has the purple ball.\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives her blue ball to Claire.\n   - Claire gives her purple ball to Alice.\n   - **State after second swap:**\n     - Alice has the purple ball.\n     - Bob has the brown ball.\n     - Claire has the blue ball.\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives his brown ball to Claire.\n   - Claire gives her blue ball to Bob.\n   - **State after third swap:**\n     - Alice has the purple ball.\n     - Bob has the blue ball.\n     - Claire has the brown ball.\n\nAfter all the swaps, Alice ends up with the purple ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
