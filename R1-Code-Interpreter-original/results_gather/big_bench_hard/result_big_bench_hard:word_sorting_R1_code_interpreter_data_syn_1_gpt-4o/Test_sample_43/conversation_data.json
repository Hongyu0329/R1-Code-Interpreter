    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is: \n\n- tuba\n- synapse\n- inaudible\n- brewster\n- tithing\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"tuba\", \"synapse\", \"inaudible\", \"brewster\", \"tithing\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words. The words have been sorted alphabetically as follows:\n\n1. brewster\n2. inaudible\n3. synapse\n4. tithing\n5. tuba\n\nThe sorting process used Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which arranges the words in lexicographical order.\n\n<<<brewster, inaudible, synapse, tithing, tuba>>>"
