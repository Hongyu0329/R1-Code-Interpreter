    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- chlorate\n- glidden\n- incentive\n- manatee\n- spurt\n- lavoisier\n- judicatory\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"chlorate\", \"glidden\", \"incentive\", \"manatee\", \"spurt\", \"lavoisier\", \"judicatory\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the list of words has been sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- chlorate\n- glidden\n- incentive\n- judicatory\n- lavoisier\n- manatee\n- spurt\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<chlorate, glidden, incentive, judicatory, lavoisier, manatee, spurt>>>"
