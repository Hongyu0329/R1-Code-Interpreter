    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- crowfoot\n- scrupulous\n- campfire\n- contrast\n- purgatory\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"crowfoot\", \"scrupulous\", \"campfire\", \"contrast\", \"purgatory\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words. The words have been arranged in alphabetical order as follows:\n\n- campfire\n- contrast\n- crowfoot\n- purgatory\n- scrupulous\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<campfire, contrast, crowfoot, purgatory, scrupulous>>>"
