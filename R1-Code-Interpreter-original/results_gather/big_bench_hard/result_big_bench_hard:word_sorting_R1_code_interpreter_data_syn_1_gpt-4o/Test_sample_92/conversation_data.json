    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The words provided are:\n\n- coypu\n- anharmonic\n- inflammation\n- beauteous\n\nThe task is to arrange these words in alphabetical order. In Python, we can use the `sorted()` function to achieve this. The `sorted()` function will return a new list that is sorted in ascending order by default, which is what we need for alphabetical sorting.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort these words alphabetically.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"coypu\", \"anharmonic\", \"inflammation\", \"beauteous\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the words sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- anharmonic\n- beauteous\n- coypu\n- inflammation\n\nThis is the correct alphabetical order for the given list of words.\n\n<<<['anharmonic', 'beauteous', 'coypu', 'inflammation']>>>"
