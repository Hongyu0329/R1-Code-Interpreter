    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- gentle\n- boletus\n- galveston\n- aniline\n- eddy\n- fontainebleau\n- wile\n- scandalous\n- skat\n- sportsmen\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"gentle\", \"boletus\", \"galveston\", \"aniline\", \"eddy\", \"fontainebleau\", \"wile\", \"scandalous\", \"skat\", \"sportsmen\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the list of words has been sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- aniline\n- boletus\n- eddy\n- fontainebleau\n- galveston\n- gentle\n- scandalous\n- skat\n- sportsmen\n- wile\n\n<<<aniline, boletus, eddy, fontainebleau, galveston, gentle, scandalous, skat, sportsmen, wile>>>"
