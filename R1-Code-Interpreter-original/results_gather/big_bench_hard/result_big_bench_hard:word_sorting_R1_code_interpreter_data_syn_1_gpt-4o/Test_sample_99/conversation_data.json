    "To solve the problem of sorting the words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: We have the list of words: \"lise\", \"snipe\", and \"miaow\".\n2. **Sort the Words**: We will sort these words in alphabetical order. In Python, this can be done using the `sorted()` function, which returns a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this sorting operation.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"lise\", \"snipe\", \"miaow\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words. The words \"lise\", \"miaow\", and \"snipe\" have been sorted alphabetically.\n\nThe final sorted order is:\n\n1. lise\n2. miaow\n3. snipe\n\n<<<['lise', 'miaow', 'snipe']>>>"
