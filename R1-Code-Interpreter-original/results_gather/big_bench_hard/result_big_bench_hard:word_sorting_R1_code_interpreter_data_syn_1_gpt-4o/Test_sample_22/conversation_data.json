    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- shouldn't\n- lorenz\n- runneth\n- skintight\n- plastisol\n- swept\n- coven\n- etruscan\n- disturb\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default. Let's write a Python script to perform this sorting.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"shouldn't\", \"lorenz\", \"runneth\", \"skintight\", \"plastisol\", \"swept\", \"coven\", \"etruscan\", \"disturb\"]\n\n# Sorting the list of words alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sorted list of words in alphabetical order. The sorted list is:\n\n- coven\n- disturb\n- etruscan\n- lorenz\n- plastisol\n- runneth\n- shouldn't\n- skintight\n- swept\n\nThis is the correct alphabetical order for the given list of words.\n\n<<<coven, disturb, etruscan, lorenz, plastisol, runneth, shouldn't, skintight, swept>>>"
