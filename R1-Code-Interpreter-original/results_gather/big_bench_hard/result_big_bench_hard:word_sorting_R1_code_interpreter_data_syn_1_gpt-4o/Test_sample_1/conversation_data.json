    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Define the list of words.\n2. Use Python's `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Define the list of words\nwords = [\n    \"thrill\", \"splutter\", \"panicking\", \"scorch\", \"same\", \"dot\", \"prod\",\n    \"obstetric\", \"malton\", \"onus\", \"drumhead\", \"delmarva\", \"barn\", \"embezzle\",\n    \"it&t\", \"damp\", \"guru\", \"subsist\", \"entirety\", \"greene\"\n]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the list of words has been sorted alphabetically. Here is the sorted list:\n\n<<<barn, damp, delmarva, dot, drumhead, embezzle, entirety, greene, guru, it&t, malton, obstetric, onus, panicking, prod, same, scorch, splutter, subsist, thrill>>>"
