    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- aberdeen\n- swaziland\n- sprightly\n- analogue\n- easel\n- deciduous\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"aberdeen\", \"swaziland\", \"sprightly\", \"analogue\", \"easel\", \"deciduous\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the list of words has been sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- aberdeen\n- analogue\n- deciduous\n- easel\n- sprightly\n- swaziland\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['aberdeen', 'analogue', 'deciduous', 'easel', 'sprightly', 'swaziland']>>>"
