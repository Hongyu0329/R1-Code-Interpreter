    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- comet\n- pincer\n- snippet\n- manley\n- injun\n- spokesperson\n- hydrate\n- heusen\n- cocksure\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default. Let's write a Python script to perform this sorting.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"comet\", \"pincer\", \"snippet\", \"manley\", \"injun\", \"spokesperson\", \"hydrate\", \"heusen\", \"cocksure\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute this code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is the list of words sorted alphabetically. \n\nThe sorted list is:\n1. cocksure\n2. comet\n3. heusen\n4. hydrate\n5. injun\n6. manley\n7. pincer\n8. snippet\n9. spokesperson\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['cocksure', 'comet', 'heusen', 'hydrate', 'injun', 'manley', 'pincer', 'snippet', 'spokesperson']>>>"
