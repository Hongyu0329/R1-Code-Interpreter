    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The task involves taking the list of words and applying a sorting algorithm to arrange them in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function is well-suited for this task as it sorts any iterable and returns a new list with the elements sorted.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Define the list of words.\n2. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the list.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the list of words\nwords = [\"stephen\", \"amperage\", \"protocol\", \"crimea\", \"farther\", \"raillery\", \"tech\", \"insolent\", \"ping\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the list of words sorted alphabetically. \n\nThe sorted list is:\n- amperage\n- crimea\n- farther\n- insolent\n- ping\n- protocol\n- raillery\n- stephen\n- tech\n\n<<<['amperage', 'crimea', 'farther', 'insolent', 'ping', 'protocol', 'raillery', 'stephen', 'tech']>>>"
