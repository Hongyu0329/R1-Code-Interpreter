    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words is:\n\n- dew\n- betelgeuse\n- inexplainable\n- snazzy\n- tao\n- stain\n- meaty\n- blue\n- trail\n- wash\n- grossman\n- lyre\n- caudal\n- epoch\n- trailside\n- char\n- cyanide\n\nThe task is straightforward: we will use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort these words alphabetically. Let's write a Python script to achieve this.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\n    \"dew\", \"betelgeuse\", \"inexplainable\", \"snazzy\", \"tao\", \"stain\", \n    \"meaty\", \"blue\", \"trail\", \"wash\", \"grossman\", \"lyre\", \n    \"caudal\", \"epoch\", \"trailside\", \"char\", \"cyanide\"\n]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words alphabetically and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sorted list of words alphabetically. Now, I will present the final answer.\n\n<<<betelgeuse, blue, caudal, char, cyanide, dew, epoch, grossman, inexplainable, lyre, meaty, snazzy, stain, tao, trail, trailside, wash>>>"
