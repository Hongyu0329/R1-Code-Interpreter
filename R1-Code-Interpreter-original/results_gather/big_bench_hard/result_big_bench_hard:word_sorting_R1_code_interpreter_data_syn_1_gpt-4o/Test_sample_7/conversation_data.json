    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The task involves taking the list of words and applying a sorting algorithm to arrange them in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function is well-suited for this task as it efficiently sorts any iterable.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Define the list of words.\n2. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the list.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the list of words\nwords = [\"euclidean\", \"stonehenge\", \"hobby\", \"cloudy\", \"winsome\", \"invite\", \"thrifty\", \"fight\", \"majestic\", \"citrus\", \"surge\", \"scene\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the list of words has been sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n['citrus', 'cloudy', 'euclidean', 'fight', 'hobby', 'invite', 'majestic', 'scene', 'stonehenge', 'surge', 'thrifty', 'winsome']\n\n<<<answer>>>['citrus', 'cloudy', 'euclidean', 'fight', 'hobby', 'invite', 'majestic', 'scene', 'stonehenge', 'surge', 'thrifty', 'winsome']<<<answer>>>"
