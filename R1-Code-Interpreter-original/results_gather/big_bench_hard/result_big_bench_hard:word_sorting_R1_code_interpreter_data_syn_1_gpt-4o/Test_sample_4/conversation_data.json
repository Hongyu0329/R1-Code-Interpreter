    "To solve the problem of sorting the given words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. List the words: \"indifferent\", \"trainman\", \"bootlegging\".\n2. Use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort these words alphabetically.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"indifferent\", \"trainman\", \"bootlegging\"]\n\n# Sort the words alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and sorted the words alphabetically. The sorted order of the words is:\n\n1. \"bootlegging\"\n2. \"indifferent\"\n3. \"trainman\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<bootlegging, indifferent, trainman>>>"
