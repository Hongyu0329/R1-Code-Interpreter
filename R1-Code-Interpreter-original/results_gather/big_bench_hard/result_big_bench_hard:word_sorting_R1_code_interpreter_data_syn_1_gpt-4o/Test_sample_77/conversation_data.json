    "To solve the problem of sorting the given words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: We have a list of words: [\"oblong\", \"bucolic\", \"whoosh\"].\n\n2. **Sorting Mechanism**: In Python, we can use the built-in `sorted()` function to sort a list of strings alphabetically. This function will compare the strings lexicographically, which means it will sort them based on the Unicode code point number of each character.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We will write a simple Python script to sort the list and print the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"oblong\", \"bucolic\", \"whoosh\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words alphabetically. The words \"bucolic\", \"oblong\", and \"whoosh\" have been sorted in the correct order.\n\n<<<['bucolic', 'oblong', 'whoosh']>>>"
