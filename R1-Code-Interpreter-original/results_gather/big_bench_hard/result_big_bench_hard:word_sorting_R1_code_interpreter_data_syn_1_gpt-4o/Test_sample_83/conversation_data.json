    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- definite\n- translate\n- aggression\n- arachne\n- lengthy\n- sanford\n- bystander\n- asplenium\n- gneiss\n- southeast\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"definite\", \"translate\", \"aggression\", \"arachne\", \"lengthy\", \"sanford\", \"bystander\", \"asplenium\", \"gneiss\", \"southeast\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the sorted list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words in alphabetical order. Now, I will provide the final answer based on the output.\n\n<<<answer\n['aggression', 'arachne', 'asplenium', 'bystander', 'definite', 'gneiss', 'lengthy', 'sanford', 'southeast', 'translate']\n>>>"
