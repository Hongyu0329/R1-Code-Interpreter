    "To solve the problem of sorting the words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Take the list of words: [\"thunder\", \"phase\", \"geld\"].\n2. Use a sorting algorithm or a built-in function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Return the sorted list.\n\nPython provides a built-in function `sorted()` that can be used to sort a list of strings alphabetically. Let's write a Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"thunder\", \"phase\", \"geld\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words alphabetically. Based on the output, the words have been sorted in the following order: \"geld\", \"phase\", \"thunder\".\n\n<<<['geld', 'phase', 'thunder']>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Sort the following words alphabetically: List: thunder phase geld\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
