    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is: `[\"yeager\", \"bengal\", \"fettle\"]`.\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n\n1. Create a list with the given words.\n2. Use Python's `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"yeager\", \"bengal\", \"fettle\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the sorted list of words: `['bengal', 'fettle', 'yeager']`. This confirms that the words have been sorted alphabetically.\n\n<<<['bengal', 'fettle', 'yeager']>>>"
