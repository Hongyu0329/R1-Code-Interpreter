    "To solve this problem, we need to sort the given list of words alphabetically. The list of words is:\n\n- inflammation\n- slump\n- schiller\n- jacqueline\n- darkle\n- piano\n- fungi\n- sojourn\n- macaque\n- joanne\n- gobble\n- boldface\n- sst\n\nThe task is straightforward: we will use Python's built-in sorting functionality to sort these words alphabetically. The sorted list will be printed as the output.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\n    \"inflammation\", \"slump\", \"schiller\", \"jacqueline\", \"darkle\", \n    \"piano\", \"fungi\", \"sojourn\", \"macaque\", \"joanne\", \n    \"gobble\", \"boldface\", \"sst\"\n]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the list of words has been sorted alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- boldface\n- darkle\n- fungi\n- gobble\n- inflammation\n- jacqueline\n- joanne\n- macaque\n- piano\n- schiller\n- slump\n- sojourn\n- sst\n\nThis is the correct alphabetical order for the given list of words.\n\n<<<boldface, darkle, fungi, gobble, inflammation, jacqueline, joanne, macaque, piano, schiller, slump, sojourn, sst>>>"
