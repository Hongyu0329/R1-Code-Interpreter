    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The task involves taking the list of words and applying a sorting algorithm to arrange them in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function is well-suited for this task as it sorts the elements of a list in ascending order by default.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Define the list of words.\n2. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the list of words\nwords = [\"skinny\", \"sharon\", \"sudan\", \"earthy\", \"parentage\", \"hello\", \"inmate\", \"announce\", \"co\", \"clayton\", \"carp\", \"phonetic\", \"watson\", \"nimbus\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sorted list of words in alphabetical order. The list is now arranged from 'announce' to 'watson'. \n\nHere is the final sorted list:\n\n<<<['announce', 'carp', 'clayton', 'co', 'earthy', 'hello', 'inmate', 'nimbus', 'parentage', 'phonetic', 'sharon', 'skinny', 'sudan', 'watson']>>>"
