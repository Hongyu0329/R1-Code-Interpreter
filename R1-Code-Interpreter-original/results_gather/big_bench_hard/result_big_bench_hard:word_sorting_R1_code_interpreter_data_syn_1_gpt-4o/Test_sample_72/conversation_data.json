    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- sound\n- consternate\n- tariff\n- blest\n- proximity\n- quizzes\n- xerxes\n- buxton\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"sound\", \"consternate\", \"tariff\", \"blest\", \"proximity\", \"quizzes\", \"xerxes\", \"buxton\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and sorted the list of words alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- blest\n- buxton\n- consternate\n- proximity\n- quizzes\n- sound\n- tariff\n- xerxes\n\nThis is the correct alphabetical order for the given list of words.\n\n<<<['blest', 'buxton', 'consternate', 'proximity', 'quizzes', 'sound', 'tariff', 'xerxes']>>>"
