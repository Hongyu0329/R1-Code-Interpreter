    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- regret\n- starlight\n- wallboard\n- cotyledon\n- more\n- pepperoni\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default. \n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"regret\", \"starlight\", \"wallboard\", \"cotyledon\", \"more\", \"pepperoni\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will return the sorted list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output is the sorted list of words in alphabetical order. \n\nThe sorted list is:\n1. cotyledon\n2. more\n3. pepperoni\n4. regret\n5. starlight\n6. wallboard\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['cotyledon', 'more', 'pepperoni', 'regret', 'starlight', 'wallboard']>>>"
