    "To solve the problem of sorting the words \"kenya\" and \"beth\" alphabetically, we need to compare the words based on their lexicographical order. In Python, strings can be compared directly using comparison operators, and the `sorted()` function can be used to sort a list of strings alphabetically.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We have a list of words: `[\"kenya\", \"beth\"]`.\n2. We need to sort this list alphabetically.\n3. The `sorted()` function in Python will help us achieve this by returning a new list that is sorted.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this sorting:\n\n```python\n# List of words to sort\nwords = [\"kenya\", \"beth\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words. The words \"kenya\" and \"beth\" have been sorted alphabetically, resulting in the order \"beth\" followed by \"kenya\".\n\n<<<['beth', 'kenya']>>>"
