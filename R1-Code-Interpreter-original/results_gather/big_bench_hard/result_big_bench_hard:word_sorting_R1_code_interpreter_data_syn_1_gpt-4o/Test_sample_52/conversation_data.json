    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is: \n\n- walnut\n- scoot\n- jugoslavia\n- retrorocket\n- polyhedron\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. In Python, we can use the `sorted()` function, which returns a new list containing all items from the original list in ascending order. This function is case-sensitive and sorts based on the ASCII values of the characters.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list of words alphabetically.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"walnut\", \"scoot\", \"jugoslavia\", \"retrorocket\", \"polyhedron\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Output the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the sorted list of words in alphabetical order. The words are sorted based on their ASCII values, which is the standard behavior for string sorting in Python.\n\nThe sorted list is:\n\n1. jugoslavia\n2. polyhedron\n3. retrorocket\n4. scoot\n5. walnut\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['jugoslavia', 'polyhedron', 'retrorocket', 'scoot', 'walnut']>>>"
