    "To solve the problem of sorting the words \"broaden\" and \"envy\" alphabetically, we need to compare the words based on the lexicographical order of their characters. In Python, we can use the built-in `sorted()` function to achieve this. The `sorted()` function will take a list of words and return a new list with the words sorted in alphabetical order.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the given list of words.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"broaden\", \"envy\"]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the sorted list of words. The words \"broaden\" and \"envy\" are already in alphabetical order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['broaden', 'envy']>>>"
