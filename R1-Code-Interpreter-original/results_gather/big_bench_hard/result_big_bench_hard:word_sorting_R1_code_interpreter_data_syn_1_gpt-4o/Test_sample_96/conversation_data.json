    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The task involves taking the list of words and arranging them in alphabetical order. Python provides a straightforward way to sort lists using the `sorted()` function, which will be efficient for this task.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Define the list of words.\n2. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically.\n3. Print the sorted list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the list of words\nwords = [\n    \"falter\", \"tuscarora\", \"invigorate\", \"porridge\", \"wetland\", \n    \"libya\", \"residuary\", \"wrapup\", \"ludlow\", \"landlady\", \n    \"kamikaze\", \"christiana\", \"jot\", \"antler\", \"mallow\"\n]\n\n# Sort the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the sorted list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sorted list of words alphabetically. The list is now arranged from 'antler' to 'wrapup'.\n\n<<<antler, christiana, falter, invigorate, jot, kamikaze, landlady, libya, ludlow, mallow, porridge, residuary, tuscarora, wetland, wrapup>>>"
