    "To solve the problem of sorting the given list of words alphabetically, we can use Python's built-in sorting functionality. The list of words provided is:\n\n- above\n- prometheus\n- broken\n- coexist\n- big\n- dominate\n- olive\n- screw\n- thirdhand\n- irk\n\nThe task is to sort these words in alphabetical order. Python's `sorted()` function can be used to achieve this, as it sorts strings lexicographically by default.\n\nLet's write a Python script to sort the list and print the sorted result.\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"above\", \"prometheus\", \"broken\", \"coexist\", \"big\", \"dominate\", \"olive\", \"screw\", \"thirdhand\", \"irk\"]\n\n# Sorting the list alphabetically\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis script will sort the list of words and print the sorted list. Let's execute the code to get the sorted list.",
    "The code executed successfully and sorted the list of words alphabetically. The sorted list is:\n\n- above\n- big\n- broken\n- coexist\n- dominate\n- irk\n- olive\n- prometheus\n- screw\n- thirdhand\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<above, big, broken, coexist, dominate, irk, olive, prometheus, screw, thirdhand>>>"
