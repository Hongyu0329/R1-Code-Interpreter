    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words provided in the question:\n   - regret\n   - starlight\n   - wallboard\n   - cotyledon\n   - more\n   - pepperoni\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**: Begin by comparing the first letter of each word:\n   - c (cotyledon)\n   - m (more)\n   - p (pepperoni)\n   - r (regret)\n   - s (starlight)\n   - w (wallboard)\n\n   The order of the first letters alphabetically is: c, m, p, r, s, w.\n\n4. **Sort by First Letter**: Arrange the words based on the first letter:\n   - cotyledon\n   - more\n   - pepperoni\n   - regret\n   - starlight\n   - wallboard\n\n5. **Check for Ties**: If two words start with the same letter, compare the second letter, and so on, until the order is determined. In this case, all words start with different letters, so no further comparison is needed.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: The words are now sorted alphabetically.\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> cotyledon more pepperoni regret starlight wallboard"
