    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the problem:\n   - xylem\n   - neoclassic\n   - rest\n   - fortieth\n   - marshall\n   - wiley\n   - convey\n   - experiment\n   - whimper\n   - kudo\n   - decimate\n   - incautious\n   - z's\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: Begin sorting the words by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Sorting**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word:\n     - c: convey\n     - d: decimate\n     - e: experiment\n     - f: fortieth\n     - i: incautious\n     - k: kudo\n     - m: marshall\n     - n: neoclassic\n     - r: rest\n     - w: whimper, wiley\n     - x: xylem\n     - z: z's\n\n5. **Order the Words**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order based on the first letter, and then by subsequent letters if needed:\n   - convey\n   - decimate\n   - experiment\n   - fortieth\n   - incautious\n   - kudo\n   - marshall\n   - neoclassic\n   - rest\n   - whimper\n   - wiley\n   - xylem\n   - z's\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\n<<<answer>>> convey decimate experiment fortieth incautious kudo marshall neoclassic rest whimper wiley xylem z's <<<answer>>>"
