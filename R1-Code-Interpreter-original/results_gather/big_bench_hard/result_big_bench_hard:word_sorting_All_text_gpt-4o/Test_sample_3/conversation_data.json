    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words provided in the question:\n   - sioux\n   - fortescue\n   - purloin\n   - percept\n   - helmsman\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: Begin comparing the words based on their first letters:\n   - The first letters of the words are: s (sioux), f (fortescue), p (purloin), p (percept), h (helmsman).\n   - According to the alphabetical order: f, h, p, s.\n\n4. **Sort by First Letter**: Arrange the words based on the first letter:\n   - fortescue (f)\n   - helmsman (h)\n   - purloin (p)\n   - percept (p)\n   - sioux (s)\n\n5. **Resolve Ties**: For words starting with the same letter, compare the subsequent letters:\n   - purloin and percept both start with 'p'. Compare the second letters: 'u' in purloin and 'e' in percept. Since 'e' comes before 'u', percept should come before purloin.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: After resolving ties, the final sorted list is:\n   - fortescue\n   - helmsman\n   - percept\n   - purloin\n   - sioux\n\nBy following these steps, we have sorted the list of words alphabetically.\n\n<<<answer>>> fortescue helmsman percept purloin sioux <<<answer>>>"
