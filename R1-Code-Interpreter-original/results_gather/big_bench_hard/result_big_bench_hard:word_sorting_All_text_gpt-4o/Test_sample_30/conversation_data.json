    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted. The words given are:\n   - summand\n   - cure\n   - gloria\n   - tyke\n   - doubtful\n   - extoller\n   - entropy\n   - crackle\n   - procedural\n   - cottrell\n   - litigant\n   - bologna\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Initial Letter Comparison**: Start by comparing the first letter of each word. If two words have the same initial letter, compare the second letter, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Based on the alphabetical order, we sort the words:\n   - Start with words beginning with 'b': bologna\n   - Next, words beginning with 'c': crackle, cottrell, cure\n   - Then, words beginning with 'd': doubtful\n   - Followed by words beginning with 'e': entropy, extoller\n   - Then, words beginning with 'g': gloria\n   - Followed by words beginning with 'l': litigant\n   - Then, words beginning with 'p': procedural\n   - Followed by words beginning with 's': summand\n   - Finally, words beginning with 't': tyke\n\n5. **Final Sorted List**: After sorting, the words in alphabetical order are:\n   - bologna\n   - crackle\n   - cottrell\n   - cure\n   - doubtful\n   - entropy\n   - extoller\n   - gloria\n   - litigant\n   - procedural\n   - summand\n   - tyke\n\nBy following these steps, we have sorted the list of words alphabetically.\n\n<<<answer>>>bologna, crackle, cottrell, cure, doubtful, entropy, extoller, gloria, litigant, procedural, summand, tyke<<<answer>>>"
