    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - voluntary\n   - yucca\n   - limnology\n   - fabulous\n   - seventh\n   - cube\n   - willow\n   - kitakyushu\n   - sequel\n   - senescent\n   - bauble\n   - length\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: Begin sorting the words by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Sorting**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word:\n     - b: bauble\n     - c: cube\n     - f: fabulous\n     - k: kitakyushu\n     - l: limnology, length\n     - s: seventh, sequel, senescent\n     - v: voluntary\n     - w: willow\n     - y: yucca\n\n5. **Sort Words with the Same Initial Letter**:\n   - For 'l': Compare \"limnology\" and \"length\". \"length\" comes before \"limnology\".\n   - For 's': Compare \"seventh\", \"sequel\", and \"senescent\". \"senescent\" comes first, followed by \"sequel\", and then \"seventh\".\n\n6. **Compile the Sorted List**: Combine all the sorted words into a single list.\n   - bauble\n   - cube\n   - fabulous\n   - kitakyushu\n   - length\n   - limnology\n   - senescent\n   - sequel\n   - seventh\n   - voluntary\n   - willow\n   - yucca\n\n7. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> bauble, cube, fabulous, kitakyushu, length, limnology, senescent, sequel, seventh, voluntary, willow, yucca <<<answer>>>"
