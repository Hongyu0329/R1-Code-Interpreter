    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words provided in the question:\n   - sound\n   - consternate\n   - tariff\n   - blest\n   - proximity\n   - quizzes\n   - xerxes\n   - buxton\n\n2. **Compare Words Alphabetically**: To sort the words alphabetically, compare each word based on the order of letters in the English alphabet. The order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**:\n   - Start by identifying the word that comes first alphabetically. In this case, \"blest\" starts with 'b', which is the earliest letter among the first letters of all the words.\n   - Next, compare the remaining words. \"buxton\" also starts with 'b', but 'l' in \"blest\" comes before 'u' in \"buxton\".\n   - Continue this process for the rest of the words:\n     - \"consternate\" starts with 'c'.\n     - \"proximity\" starts with 'p'.\n     - \"quizzes\" starts with 'q'.\n     - \"sound\" starts with 's'.\n     - \"tariff\" starts with 't'.\n     - \"xerxes\" starts with 'x'.\n\n4. **Order the Words**: Arrange the words in the order determined by the comparisons:\n   - blest\n   - buxton\n   - consternate\n   - proximity\n   - quizzes\n   - sound\n   - tariff\n   - xerxes\n\n5. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> blest, buxton, consternate, proximity, quizzes, sound, tariff, xerxes <<<answer>>>"
