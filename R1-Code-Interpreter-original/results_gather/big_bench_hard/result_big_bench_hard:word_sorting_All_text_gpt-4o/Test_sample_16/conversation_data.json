    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to have a clear list of all the words provided:\n   - marlborough\n   - pyrotechnic\n   - filly\n   - grocer\n   - treadle\n   - transitive\n   - platelet\n   - deliver\n   - landau\n   - hotbox\n   - uncle\n   - siemens\n   - anger\n   - hessian\n   - gneiss\n   - convoy\n   - ninebark\n   - advent\n   - plat\n   - stapleton\n\n2. **Sort Alphabetically**: We will sort these words in alphabetical order. This involves comparing the words letter by letter, starting from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n3. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that all words are compared in a case-insensitive manner, as alphabetical sorting is typically case-insensitive.\n   - Pay attention to words that may have similar starting letters but differ later on.\n   - Ensure that the list is complete and no words are omitted or duplicated.\n\n4. **Sorting Process**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word.\n   - Arrange the words in order based on the first letter.\n   - For words with the same first letter, compare the second letter, and continue this process until the order is determined.\n\n5. **Sorted List**:\n   - advent\n   - anger\n   - convoy\n   - deliver\n   - filly\n   - gneiss\n   - grocer\n   - hessian\n   - hotbox\n   - landau\n   - marlborough\n   - ninebark\n   - plat\n   - platelet\n   - pyrotechnic\n   - siemens\n   - stapleton\n   - treadle\n   - transitive\n   - uncle\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\n<<<advent, anger, convoy, deliver, filly, gneiss, grocer, hessian, hotbox, landau, marlborough, ninebark, plat, platelet, pyrotechnic, siemens, stapleton, treadle, transitive, uncle>>>"
