    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - odessa\n   - dance\n   - formulae\n   - dietetic\n   - mantle\n   - cost\n   - huddle\n   - resplendent\n   - bolshevism\n   - proust\n   - warmth\n   - deadline\n   - progeny\n   - hesitant\n   - palace\n   - rackety\n   - judson\n   - foster\n   - belize\n   - thirdhand\n\n2. **Sort the Words**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order. This involves comparing the words based on the alphabetical order of their letters, starting from the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n3. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that all words are compared in a case-insensitive manner, as alphabetical sorting is typically case-insensitive.\n   - Pay attention to words that may have similar starting letters but differ later in the word.\n   - Double-check the order to ensure no words are missed or incorrectly placed.\n\n4. **Sorted List**:\n   - belize\n   - bolshevism\n   - cost\n   - dance\n   - deadline\n   - dietetic\n   - formulae\n   - foster\n   - hesitant\n   - huddle\n   - judson\n   - mantle\n   - odessa\n   - palace\n   - progeny\n   - proust\n   - rackety\n   - resplendent\n   - thirdhand\n   - warmth\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<belize, bolshevism, cost, dance, deadline, dietetic, formulae, foster, hesitant, huddle, judson, mantle, odessa, palace, progeny, proust, rackety, resplendent, thirdhand, warmth>>>"
