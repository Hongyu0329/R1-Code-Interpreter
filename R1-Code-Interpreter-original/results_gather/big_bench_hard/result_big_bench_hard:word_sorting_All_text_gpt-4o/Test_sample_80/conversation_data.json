In alphabetical sorting, words are ordered based on the sequence of letters in the alphabet. The process involves comparing the first letter of each word, and if they are the same, comparing the second letter, and so on.\n\n4. **List the Sorted Words**: After sorting, the words should be listed in the new order.\n\nLet's sort the words:\n\n- ann\n- allocate\n- bishopric\n- blake\n- carbondale\n- casual\n- cometh\n- confirmatory\n- crinkle\n- degum\n- elliot\n- expatriate\n- hangable\n- neal\n- orthodontist\n- shenandoah\n- soybean\n- telegraph\n- tuxedo\n- unipolar\n\n5. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> ann allocate bishopric blake carbondale casual cometh confirmatory crinkle degum elliot expatriate hangable neal orthodontist shenandoah soybean telegraph tuxedo unipolar <<<answer>>>"
