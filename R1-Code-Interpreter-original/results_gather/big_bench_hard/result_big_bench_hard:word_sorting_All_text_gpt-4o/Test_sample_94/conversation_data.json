    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question:\n   - quench\n   - autocracy\n   - lodge\n   - exploitation\n   - custody\n   - ventricle\n   - annuity\n   - bruno\n   - thunderclap\n   - militant\n   - somatic\n   - dare\n   - acquisitive\n\n2. **Identify the First Letter**: For each word, identify the first letter. This will help in determining the initial order.\n\n3. **Sort by First Letter**: Arrange the words based on the alphabetical order of their first letters. If two words start with the same letter, proceed to the next letter in each word to determine their order.\n\n4. **Consider Subsequent Letters**: If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on, until the order is determined.\n\n5. **Compile the Sorted List**: Once all words are compared and sorted, compile the final list.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Start with the first letters:\n  - a: acquisitive, annuity, autocracy\n  - b: bruno\n  - c: custody\n  - d: dare\n  - e: exploitation\n  - l: lodge\n  - m: militant\n  - q: quench\n  - s: somatic\n  - t: thunderclap\n  - v: ventricle\n\n- Sort the words within each group:\n  - a: acquisitive, annuity, autocracy\n  - b: bruno\n  - c: custody\n  - d: dare\n  - e: exploitation\n  - l: lodge\n  - m: militant\n  - q: quench\n  - s: somatic\n  - t: thunderclap\n  - v: ventricle\n\n- Compile the sorted list:\n  1. acquisitive\n  2. annuity\n  3. autocracy\n  4. bruno\n  5. custody\n  6. dare\n  7. exploitation\n  8. lodge\n  9. militant\n  10. quench\n  11. somatic\n  12. thunderclap\n  13. ventricle\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n\n<<<answer>>> acquisitive, annuity, autocracy, bruno, custody, dare, exploitation, lodge, militant, quench, somatic, thunderclap, ventricle <<<answer>>>"
