    "To sort the given words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: The words provided are \"lise\", \"snipe\", and \"miaow\".\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by comparing the letters from left to right. The word that comes first in the dictionary is considered to be alphabetically first.\n\n3. **Compare the Words**:\n   - Start by comparing the first letters of each word:\n     - \"lise\" starts with 'l'\n     - \"snipe\" starts with 's'\n     - \"miaow\" starts with 'm'\n   - In the alphabet, 'l' comes before 'm', and 'm' comes before 's'. Therefore, \"lise\" should come before \"miaow\", and \"miaow\" should come before \"snipe\".\n\n4. **Determine the Order**:\n   - Based on the first letter comparison, the order is:\n     1. \"lise\"\n     2. \"miaow\"\n     3. \"snipe\"\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: \n   - Double-check by comparing the words again:\n     - \"lise\" vs \"miaow\": 'l' comes before 'm', so \"lise\" is first.\n     - \"miaow\" vs \"snipe\": 'm' comes before 's', so \"miaow\" is second.\n     - \"lise\" vs \"snipe\": 'l' comes before 's', so \"lise\" is first.\n\n6. **Final Alphabetical Order**: The words in alphabetical order are \"lise\", \"miaow\", \"snipe\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<lise miaow snipe>>>"
