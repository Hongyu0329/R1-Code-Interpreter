    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - indicate\n   - quagmire\n   - predacious\n   - gut\n   - vantage\n   - marshal\n   - across\n   - smuggle\n   - flight\n   - directrix\n   - admixture\n\n2. **Identify the First Letter**: Look at the first letter of each word to determine the initial order. Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).\n\n3. **Sort by First Letter**: Arrange the words based on the first letter:\n   - Words starting with 'a': across, admixture\n   - Words starting with 'd': directrix\n   - Words starting with 'f': flight\n   - Words starting with 'g': gut\n   - Words starting with 'i': indicate\n   - Words starting with 'm': marshal\n   - Words starting with 'p': predacious\n   - Words starting with 'q': quagmire\n   - Words starting with 's': smuggle\n   - Words starting with 'v': vantage\n\n4. **Sort Words with the Same First Letter**: If multiple words start with the same letter, sort them by the subsequent letters:\n   - For 'a': across, admixture (across comes before admixture because 'c' comes before 'd')\n   - There are no other groups with the same starting letter.\n\n5. **Compile the Sorted List**: Combine the sorted words into a single list:\n   - across\n   - admixture\n   - directrix\n   - flight\n   - gut\n   - indicate\n   - marshal\n   - predacious\n   - quagmire\n   - smuggle\n   - vantage\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<across, admixture, directrix, flight, gut, indicate, marshal, predacious, quagmire, smuggle, vantage>>>"
