    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - million\n   - boone\n   - chalcedony\n   - sinai\n   - satin\n   - genteel\n   - alternate\n   - charity\n   - olden\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although the words are already in lowercase, ensure that all words are in lowercase to avoid any case sensitivity issues during sorting.\n\n3. **Sort Alphabetically**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order. This involves comparing the words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n   - Start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on.\n   - The order of the alphabet is: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n\n4. **Compare and Arrange**:\n   - Start with the first letter:\n     - \"alternate\" starts with 'a'\n     - \"boone\" starts with 'b'\n     - \"chalcedony\" and \"charity\" start with 'c'\n     - \"genteel\" starts with 'g'\n     - \"million\" starts with 'm'\n     - \"olden\" starts with 'o'\n     - \"satin\" and \"sinai\" start with 's'\n\n5. **Resolve Ties**:\n   - For words starting with 'c': \"chalcedony\" comes before \"charity\" because 'h' comes before 'r'.\n   - For words starting with 's': \"satin\" comes before \"sinai\" because 'a' comes before 'i'.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**:\n   - alternate\n   - boone\n   - chalcedony\n   - charity\n   - genteel\n   - million\n   - olden\n   - satin\n   - sinai\n\n7. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> alternate boone chalcedony charity genteel million olden satin sinai"
