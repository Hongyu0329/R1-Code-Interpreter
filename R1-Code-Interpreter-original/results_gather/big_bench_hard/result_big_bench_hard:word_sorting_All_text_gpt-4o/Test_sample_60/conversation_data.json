    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - delmarva\n   - sawfly\n   - aroma\n   - nod\n   - carcinogen\n   - parochial\n   - facetious\n   - designate\n   - syllabus\n   - rally\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: Begin comparing the words from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Arrange the words in order based on the comparisons:\n   - Start with words beginning with 'a': aroma\n   - Next, words beginning with 'c': carcinogen\n   - Then, words beginning with 'd': delmarva, designate\n   - Followed by words beginning with 'f': facetious\n   - Then, words beginning with 'n': nod\n   - Followed by words beginning with 'p': parochial\n   - Then, words beginning with 'r': rally\n   - Followed by words beginning with 's': sawfly, syllabus\n\n5. **Order Within Same Initial Letter**: For words starting with the same letter, compare the subsequent letters:\n   - Between delmarva and designate, 'delmarva' comes before 'designate' because 'e' comes before 'e' but 'l' comes before 's'.\n   - Between sawfly and syllabus, 'sawfly' comes before 'syllabus' because 'a' comes before 'y'.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: Compile the words in the correct alphabetical order:\n   - aroma\n   - carcinogen\n   - delmarva\n   - designate\n   - facetious\n   - nod\n   - parochial\n   - rally\n   - sawfly\n   - syllabus\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> aroma carcinogen delmarva designate facetious nod parochial rally sawfly syllabus <<<answer>>>"
