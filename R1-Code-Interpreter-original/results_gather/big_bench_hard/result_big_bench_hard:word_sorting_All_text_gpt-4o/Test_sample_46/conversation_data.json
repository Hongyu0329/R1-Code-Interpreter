    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list the words that need to be sorted. The words given are:\n   - aberdeen\n   - swaziland\n   - sprightly\n   - analogue\n   - easel\n   - deciduous\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: Start comparing the words from the first letter:\n   - Words starting with 'a': aberdeen, analogue\n   - Words starting with 'd': deciduous\n   - Words starting with 'e': easel\n   - Words starting with 's': swaziland, sprightly\n\n4. **Sort Words with the Same Initial Letter**: For words starting with the same letter, compare the next letters:\n   - For 'a': Compare \"aberdeen\" and \"analogue\". Since 'b' comes before 'n', \"aberdeen\" comes before \"analogue\".\n   - For 's': Compare \"swaziland\" and \"sprightly\". Since 'w' comes after 'p', \"sprightly\" comes before \"swaziland\".\n\n5. **Order the Words**: Based on the comparisons, order the words:\n   - Start with words beginning with 'a': aberdeen, analogue\n   - Next, the word beginning with 'd': deciduous\n   - Then, the word beginning with 'e': easel\n   - Finally, the words beginning with 's': sprightly, swaziland\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: Combine the ordered words into a final list.\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n- aberdeen\n- analogue\n- deciduous\n- easel\n- sprightly\n- swaziland\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> aberdeen, analogue, deciduous, easel, sprightly, swaziland <<<answer>>>"
