    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to list all the words provided in the question:\n   - thrill\n   - splutter\n   - panicking\n   - scorch\n   - same\n   - dot\n   - prod\n   - obstetric\n   - malton\n   - onus\n   - drumhead\n   - delmarva\n   - barn\n   - embezzle\n   - it&t\n   - damp\n   - guru\n   - subsist\n   - entirety\n   - greene\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although the words are already in lowercase, this step ensures uniformity in case there are any uppercase letters.\n\n3. **Sort Alphabetically**: We will sort the words based on the standard alphabetical order, which considers the ASCII values of the characters. The order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word, and if they are the same, the next letter is considered, and so on.\n\n4. **List the Sorted Words**: After sorting, we list the words in the new order.\n\nLet's go through the sorting process:\n\n- Start with the first letter of each word.\n- Compare the first letters: 'b', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'g', 'i', 'm', 'o', 'o', 'p', 's', 's', 's', 't'.\n- If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and continue this process until the words are sorted.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sorted list is:\n\n1. barn\n2. damp\n3. delmarva\n4. dot\n5. drumhead\n6. embezzle\n7. entirety\n8. greene\n9. guru\n10. it&t\n11. malton\n12. obstetric\n13. onus\n14. panicking\n15. prod\n16. same\n17. scorch\n18. splutter\n19. subsist\n20. thrill\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n\n<<<answer>>> barn, damp, delmarva, dot, drumhead, embezzle, entirety, greene, guru, it&t, malton, obstetric, onus, panicking, prod, same, scorch, splutter, subsist, thrill <<<answer>>>"
