    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - inflammation\n   - slump\n   - schiller\n   - jacqueline\n   - darkle\n   - piano\n   - fungi\n   - sojourn\n   - macaque\n   - joanne\n   - gobble\n   - boldface\n   - sst\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although the words are already in lowercase, this step ensures consistency in comparison.\n\n3. **Compare Alphabetically**: Compare the words based on the alphabetical order of their letters. The order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order based on the comparisons.\n\nLet's go through the list step by step:\n\n- Start with the first letter of each word:\n  - b: boldface\n  - d: darkle\n  - f: fungi\n  - g: gobble\n  - i: inflammation\n  - j: jacqueline, joanne\n  - m: macaque\n  - p: piano\n  - s: schiller, slump, sojourn, sst\n\n5. **Order Words with the Same Initial Letter**: For words starting with the same letter, compare the subsequent letters:\n   - For 'j': jacqueline, joanne\n   - For 's': schiller, slump, sojourn, sst\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: After sorting, the words in alphabetical order are:\n   - boldface\n   - darkle\n   - fungi\n   - gobble\n   - inflammation\n   - jacqueline\n   - joanne\n   - macaque\n   - piano\n   - schiller\n   - slump\n   - sojourn\n   - sst\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> boldface darkle fungi gobble inflammation jacqueline joanne macaque piano schiller slump sojourn sst <<<answer>>>"
