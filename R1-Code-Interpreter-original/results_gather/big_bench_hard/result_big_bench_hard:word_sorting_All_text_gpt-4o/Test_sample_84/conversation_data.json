    "To sort the given words alphabetically, we need to compare each word based on the order of letters in the English alphabet. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the words to be sorted**: \n   - chassis\n   - caruso\n   - corporal\n   - signora\n\n2. **Compare the first letters of each word**:\n   - 'chassis' starts with 'c'\n   - 'caruso' starts with 'c'\n   - 'corporal' starts with 'c'\n   - 'signora' starts with 's'\n\n   Since 's' comes after 'c' in the alphabet, 'signora' will be placed last in the sorted list.\n\n3. **Compare the second letters of the words starting with 'c'**:\n   - 'chassis' has 'h' as the second letter\n   - 'caruso' has 'a' as the second letter\n   - 'corporal' has 'o' as the second letter\n\n   The order of the second letters is: 'a', 'h', 'o'. Therefore, 'caruso' comes first, followed by 'chassis', and then 'corporal'.\n\n4. **Compile the sorted list**:\n   - First: 'caruso'\n   - Second: 'chassis'\n   - Third: 'corporal'\n   - Fourth: 'signora'\n\n5. **Final sorted list**: \n   - caruso\n   - chassis\n   - corporal\n   - signora\n\nThus, the words sorted alphabetically are:\n\n<<<caruso chassis corporal signora>>>"
