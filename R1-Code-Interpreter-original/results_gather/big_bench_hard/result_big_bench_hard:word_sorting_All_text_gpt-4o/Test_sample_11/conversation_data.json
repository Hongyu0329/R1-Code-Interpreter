    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - scrumptious\n   - sidereal\n   - thermal\n   - yakima\n   - siena\n   - gorky\n   - saxon\n   - scottish\n   - figural\n   - hydroxyl\n   - seventeen\n   - neapolitan\n   - rampage\n   - nerve\n   - grapple\n   - fate\n   - plainfield\n   - stooge\n   - knives\n   - allotted\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although the words are already in lowercase, ensure that all words are in lowercase to avoid any discrepancies due to case sensitivity.\n\n3. **Sort Alphabetically**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order. This involves comparing the words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n4. **List the Sorted Words**: After sorting, list the words in their new order.\n\nLet's go through the sorting process:\n\n- Start with the first letter of each word. If two words have the same first letter, compare the second letter, and so on.\n- For example, \"allotted\" comes before \"fate\" because 'a' comes before 'f'.\n- Continue this process for all the words.\n\nAfter sorting, the words in alphabetical order are:\n\n1. allotted\n2. fate\n3. figural\n4. gorky\n5. grapple\n6. hydroxyl\n7. knives\n8. neapolitan\n9. nerve\n10. plainfield\n11. rampage\n12. saxon\n13. scottish\n14. scrumptious\n15. seventeen\n16. siena\n17. sidereal\n18. stooge\n19. thermal\n20. yakima\n\nThe final sorted list is:\n\n<<<answer>>> allotted fate figural gorky grapple hydroxyl knives neapolitan nerve plainfield rampage saxon scottish scrumptious seventeen siena sidereal stooge thermal yakima <<<answer>>>"
