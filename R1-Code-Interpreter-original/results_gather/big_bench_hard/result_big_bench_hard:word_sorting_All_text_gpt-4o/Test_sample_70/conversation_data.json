    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to have a clear list of all the words that need to be sorted. The words given are:\n   - testy\n   - trench\n   - sin\n   - rheumatic\n   - shivery\n   - orphanage\n   - functor\n   - zorn\n   - butadiene\n   - spec\n   - racy\n   - heck\n   - flair\n   - snowball\n   - booby\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: We will compare each word starting from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until we find a difference.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Sorting**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word.\n   - Identify the word with the smallest first letter.\n   - If two words have the same first letter, compare the second letter, and continue this process.\n   - Continue this process until all words are sorted.\n\n5. **Sorted List**:\n   - booby\n   - butadiene\n   - flair\n   - functor\n   - heck\n   - orphanage\n   - racy\n   - rheumatic\n   - shivery\n   - sin\n   - snowball\n   - spec\n   - testy\n   - trench\n   - zorn\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\n<<<answer>>> booby, butadiene, flair, functor, heck, orphanage, racy, rheumatic, shivery, sin, snowball, spec, testy, trench, zorn <<<answer>>>"
