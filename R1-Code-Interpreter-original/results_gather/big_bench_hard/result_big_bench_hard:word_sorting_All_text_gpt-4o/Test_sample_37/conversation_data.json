    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - emission\n   - upon\n   - labour\n   - whim\n   - fairfax\n   - ride\n   - crepe\n   - prig\n   - accomplice\n   - az\n   - doff\n   - clatter\n   - circumcircle\n   - tea\n   - wheelbase\n   - pleura\n   - incantation\n   - choral\n   - viaduct\n   - lorry\n\n2. **Sort the Words**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order. This involves comparing the words letter by letter, starting from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n3. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive, as alphabetical order does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase.\n   - Pay attention to words that start with the same letter and ensure they are sorted correctly by subsequent letters.\n   - Double-check the order to ensure no words are missed or misplaced.\n\n4. **Sorted List**:\n   - accomplice\n   - az\n   - choral\n   - circumcircle\n   - clatter\n   - crepe\n   - doff\n   - emission\n   - fairfax\n   - incantation\n   - labour\n   - lorry\n   - pleura\n   - prig\n   - ride\n   - tea\n   - upon\n   - viaduct\n   - wheelbase\n   - whim\n\n5. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> accomplice az choral circumcircle clatter crepe doff emission fairfax incantation labour lorry pleura prig ride tea upon viaduct wheelbase whim <<<answer>>>"
