    "To sort the words alphabetically, we need to compare each word based on the order of letters in the English alphabet. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the words to be sorted**: The words given are \"yeager\", \"bengal\", and \"fettle\".\n\n2. **Compare the first letters of each word**:\n   - \"yeager\" starts with 'y'\n   - \"bengal\" starts with 'b'\n   - \"fettle\" starts with 'f'\n\n3. **Determine the alphabetical order of the first letters**:\n   - In the English alphabet, 'b' comes before 'f', and 'f' comes before 'y'.\n\n4. **Order the words based on the first letter**:\n   - \"bengal\" (starts with 'b')\n   - \"fettle\" (starts with 'f')\n   - \"yeager\" (starts with 'y')\n\n5. **Verify the order**:\n   - Since the first letters are different, we do not need to compare the subsequent letters.\n\n6. **Final sorted list**:\n   - \"bengal\"\n   - \"fettle\"\n   - \"yeager\"\n\nThe words sorted alphabetically are: \"bengal\", \"fettle\", \"yeager\".\n\n<<<bengal, fettle, yeager>>>"
