    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words that need to be sorted:\n   - coypu\n   - anharmonic\n   - inflammation\n   - beauteous\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. The order is from A to Z.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**: Begin by comparing the first letter of each word:\n   - \"coypu\" starts with 'c'\n   - \"anharmonic\" starts with 'a'\n   - \"inflammation\" starts with 'i'\n   - \"beauteous\" starts with 'b'\n\n4. **Determine Initial Order**: Based on the first letters, the initial order is:\n   - anharmonic (a)\n   - beauteous (b)\n   - coypu (c)\n   - inflammation (i)\n\n5. **Check for Ties**: If any words start with the same letter, compare the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found. In this case, all first letters are different, so no further comparison is needed.\n\n6. **List the Words in Order**: Arrange the words based on the alphabetical order determined:\n   - anharmonic\n   - beauteous\n   - coypu\n   - inflammation\n\n7. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> anharmonic beauteous coypu inflammation <<<answer>>>"
