    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to have a clear list of all the words provided:\n   - benchmark\n   - pilot\n   - reverie\n   - hatchet\n   - prorate\n   - wince\n   - machine\n   - loess\n   - stallion\n   - amphibious\n   - percentage\n   - redcoat\n   - baseplate\n   - sank\n   - assist\n   - wehr\n   - homecoming\n   - ell\n   - thoughtful\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although the words are already in lowercase, this step ensures consistency in sorting.\n\n3. **Sort Alphabetically**: We will sort the words based on the standard alphabetical order, which considers the position of each letter in the English alphabet.\n\n4. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that each word is considered individually.\n   - Pay attention to the first letter of each word, as it determines the primary order.\n   - If two words start with the same letter, compare the second letter, and so on.\n   - Ensure no words are missed or duplicated in the final sorted list.\n\n5. **Sorting Process**:\n   - Start by comparing the first letter of each word.\n   - If the first letters are the same, move to the next letter.\n   - Continue this process until the list is fully sorted.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**:\n   - amphibious\n   - assist\n   - baseplate\n   - benchmark\n   - ell\n   - hatchet\n   - homecoming\n   - loess\n   - machine\n   - percentage\n   - pilot\n   - prorate\n   - redcoat\n   - reverie\n   - sank\n   - stallion\n   - thoughtful\n   - wehr\n   - wince\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<amphibious, assist, baseplate, benchmark, ell, hatchet, homecoming, loess, machine, percentage, pilot, prorate, redcoat, reverie, sank, stallion, thoughtful, wehr, wince>>>"
