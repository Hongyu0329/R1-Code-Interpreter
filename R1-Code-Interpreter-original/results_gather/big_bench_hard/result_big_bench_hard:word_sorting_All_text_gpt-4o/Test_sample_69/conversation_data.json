    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted:\n   - berniece\n   - bremsstrahlung\n   - hoe\n   - avalanche\n   - showroom\n   - goff\n   - dactylic\n   - befriend\n   - hurry\n   - housekeep\n   - lanka\n   - gilbertson\n   - posterior\n   - flick\n   - bong\n   - hereafter\n   - metazoan\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although all words are already in lowercase, this step ensures uniformity when comparing words alphabetically.\n\n3. **Compare Words Alphabetically**: We need to compare the words based on the alphabetical order of their letters. The order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Using the alphabetical comparison, we sort the words in ascending order.\n\n5. **List the Sorted Words**: After sorting, we list the words in their new order.\n\nLet's go through the sorting process:\n\n- Start with the first letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n- The words starting with 'a' are: avalanche.\n- The words starting with 'b' are: berniece, bremsstrahlung, befriend, bong.\n- The words starting with 'c' are: none.\n- The words starting with 'd' are: dactylic.\n- The words starting with 'e' are: none.\n- The words starting with 'f' are: flick.\n- The words starting with 'g' are: goff, gilbertson.\n- The words starting with 'h' are: hoe, hurry, housekeep, hereafter.\n- The words starting with 'i' to 'k' are: none.\n- The words starting with 'l' are: lanka.\n- The words starting with 'm' are: metazoan.\n- The words starting with 'n' to 'o' are: none.\n- The words starting with 'p' are: posterior.\n- The words starting with 'q' to 'r' are: none.\n- The words starting with 's' are: showroom.\n- The words starting with 't' to 'z' are: none.\n\nNow, sort the words within each group:\n- 'b' group: befriend, berniece, bong, bremsstrahlung\n- 'g' group: gilbertson, goff\n- 'h' group: hereafter, hoe, housekeep, hurry\n\nFinally, list all the words in sorted order:\n1. avalanche\n2. befriend\n3. berniece\n4. bong\n5. bremsstrahlung\n6. dactylic\n7. flick\n8. gilbertson\n9. goff\n10. hereafter\n11. hoe\n12. housekeep\n13. hurry\n14. lanka\n15. metazoan\n16. posterior\n17. showroom\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n\n<<<answer>>> avalanche, befriend, berniece, bong, bremsstrahlung, dactylic, flick, gilbertson, goff, hereafter, hoe, housekeep, hurry, lanka, metazoan, posterior, showroom <<<answer>>>"
