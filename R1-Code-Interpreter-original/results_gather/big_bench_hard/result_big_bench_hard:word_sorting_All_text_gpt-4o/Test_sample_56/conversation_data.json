    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list out the words provided in the question:\n   - above\n   - prometheus\n   - broken\n   - coexist\n   - big\n   - dominate\n   - olive\n   - screw\n   - thirdhand\n   - irk\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: Start comparing the words based on the first letter. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word:\n     - a: above\n     - b: big, broken\n     - c: coexist\n     - d: dominate\n     - i: irk\n     - o: olive\n     - p: prometheus\n     - s: screw\n     - t: thirdhand\n\n5. **Order Words with the Same Initial Letter**:\n   - For words starting with 'b': big, broken\n     - Compare the second letter: 'i' comes before 'r', so the order is big, broken.\n\n6. **Compile the Sorted List**:\n   - above\n   - big\n   - broken\n   - coexist\n   - dominate\n   - irk\n   - olive\n   - prometheus\n   - screw\n   - thirdhand\n\n7. **Final Check**: Ensure that all words are included and correctly ordered.\n\nThe final sorted list of words in alphabetical order is:\n\n<<<answer>>> above, big, broken, coexist, dominate, irk, olive, prometheus, screw, thirdhand <<<answer>>>"
