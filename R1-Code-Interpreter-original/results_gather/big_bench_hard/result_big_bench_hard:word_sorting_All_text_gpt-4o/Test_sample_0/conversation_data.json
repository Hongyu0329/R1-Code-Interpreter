    "To sort the words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Words**: The words given in the list are \"syndrome\" and \"therefrom\".\n\n2. **Compare the Words Alphabetically**:\n   - Alphabetical order is determined by comparing the letters of each word from left to right.\n   - Start by comparing the first letter of each word:\n     - \"syndrome\" starts with 's'.\n     - \"therefrom\" starts with 't'.\n   - In the English alphabet, 's' comes before 't'.\n\n3. **Determine the Order**:\n   - Since 's' comes before 't', \"syndrome\" should come before \"therefrom\" in alphabetical order.\n\n4. **List the Words in Order**:\n   - The correct alphabetical order of the words is: \"syndrome\", \"therefrom\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the alphabetical order of the given words.\n\n<<<syndrome, therefrom>>>"
