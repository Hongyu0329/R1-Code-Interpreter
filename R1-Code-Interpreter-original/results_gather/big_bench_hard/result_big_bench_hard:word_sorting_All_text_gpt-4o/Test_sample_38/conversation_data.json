    "To sort the words \"kenya\" and \"beth\" alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Words**: We have two words to sort: \"kenya\" and \"beth\".\n\n2. **Compare the Words Alphabetically**:\n   - Alphabetical order is determined by comparing the letters of each word from left to right.\n   - Start by comparing the first letter of each word.\n\n3. **First Letter Comparison**:\n   - The first letter of \"kenya\" is 'k'.\n   - The first letter of \"beth\" is 'b'.\n\n4. **Determine Alphabetical Order**:\n   - In the English alphabet, 'b' comes before 'k'.\n   - Therefore, \"beth\" should come before \"kenya\" when sorted alphabetically.\n\n5. **Final Order**:\n   - Based on the comparison, the correct alphabetical order is \"beth\" followed by \"kenya\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the correct alphabetical order of the given words.\n\n<<<beth kenya>>>"
