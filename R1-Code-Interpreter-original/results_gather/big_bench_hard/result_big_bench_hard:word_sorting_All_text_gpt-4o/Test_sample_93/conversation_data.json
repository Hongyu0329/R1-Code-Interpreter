    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question:\n   - consignee\n   - can't\n   - artistry\n   - golf\n   - cascade\n   - markov\n   - nine\n   - swingable\n   - shanghai\n   - condiment\n   - projectile\n   - mimosa\n   - glance\n   - gentlemen\n   - wildflower\n   - tale\n\n2. **Consider Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: Note that special characters like apostrophes (') are considered before letters in alphabetical sorting. Therefore, \"can't\" will come before words starting with \"c\" without an apostrophe.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Begin sorting the words based on the alphabetical order:\n   - Start with words beginning with 'a': artistry\n   - Next, consider words starting with 'c'. Remember that \"can't\" comes first due to the apostrophe: can't, cascade, condiment, consignee\n   - Words starting with 'g': gentlemen, glance, golf\n   - Words starting with 'm': markov, mimosa\n   - Words starting with 'n': nine\n   - Words starting with 'p': projectile\n   - Words starting with 's': shanghai, swingable\n   - Words starting with 't': tale\n   - Words starting with 'w': wildflower\n\n5. **Compile the Sorted List**: After sorting, the list of words in alphabetical order is:\n   - artistry\n   - can't\n   - cascade\n   - condiment\n   - consignee\n   - gentlemen\n   - glance\n   - golf\n   - markov\n   - mimosa\n   - nine\n   - projectile\n   - shanghai\n   - swingable\n   - tale\n   - wildflower\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> artistry can't cascade condiment consignee gentlemen glance golf markov mimosa nine projectile shanghai swingable tale wildflower <<<answer>>>"
