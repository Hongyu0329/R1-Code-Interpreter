    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words that need to be sorted:\n   - bituminous\n   - ami\n   - decadent\n   - knickerbocker\n   - exeter\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. The order is from 'A' to 'Z'. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n3. **Compare the Words**:\n   - Start by comparing the first letters of each word.\n   - 'ami' starts with 'a', which is the earliest in the alphabet.\n   - 'bituminous' starts with 'b'.\n   - 'decadent' starts with 'd'.\n   - 'exeter' starts with 'e'.\n   - 'knickerbocker' starts with 'k'.\n\n4. **Order the Words**:\n   - 'ami' comes first because it starts with 'a'.\n   - 'bituminous' comes next because it starts with 'b'.\n   - 'decadent' follows because it starts with 'd'.\n   - 'exeter' is next because it starts with 'e'.\n   - 'knickerbocker' comes last because it starts with 'k'.\n\n5. **Final Sorted List**: After sorting the words based on the alphabetical order of their first letters, we get the following sequence:\n   - ami\n   - bituminous\n   - decadent\n   - exeter\n   - knickerbocker\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<ami bituminous decadent exeter knickerbocker>>>"
