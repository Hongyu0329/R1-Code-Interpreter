    "To sort the words alphabetically, we need to compare the words based on the order of letters in the English alphabet. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the words to be sorted**: The words given are \"sortie\", \"neff\", and \"nicodemus\".\n\n2. **Compare the first letters of each word**:\n   - \"sortie\" starts with 's'.\n   - \"neff\" starts with 'n'.\n   - \"nicodemus\" starts with 'n'.\n\n3. **Determine the alphabetical order of the first letters**:\n   - The letter 'n' comes before 's' in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Compare words with the same starting letter**:\n   - Both \"neff\" and \"nicodemus\" start with 'n'. We need to compare the second letters.\n   - \"neff\" has 'e' as the second letter.\n   - \"nicodemus\" has 'i' as the second letter.\n   - The letter 'e' comes before 'i' in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Determine the final order**:\n   - \"neff\" comes first because it starts with 'n' and the second letter 'e' comes before 'i'.\n   - \"nicodemus\" comes next because it also starts with 'n', but the second letter 'i' comes after 'e'.\n   - \"sortie\" comes last because it starts with 's', which comes after 'n'.\n\n6. **Final sorted order**: The words in alphabetical order are \"neff\", \"nicodemus\", and \"sortie\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> neff nicodemus sortie"
