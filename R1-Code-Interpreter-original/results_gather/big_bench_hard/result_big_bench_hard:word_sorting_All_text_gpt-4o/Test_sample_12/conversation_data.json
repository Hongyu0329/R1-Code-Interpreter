    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - lucrative\n   - you've\n   - tunnel\n   - archery\n   - bride\n   - coquette\n   - polytypy\n   - barbudo\n   - radix\n   - arlen\n   - lockwood\n   - teem\n   - officious\n\n2. **Consider Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When sorting words, we compare them letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Handle Special Characters**: The word \"you've\" contains an apostrophe. In alphabetical sorting, special characters like apostrophes are usually ignored, and the word is treated as if the apostrophe is not there.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Begin sorting the words by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n5. **List the Sorted Words**: After sorting, list the words in their new order.\n\nLet's sort the words step by step:\n\n- Start with the first letter of each word:\n  - a: archery, arlen\n  - b: barbudo, bride\n  - c: coquette\n  - l: lockwood, lucrative\n  - o: officious\n  - p: polytypy\n  - r: radix\n  - t: teem, tunnel\n  - y: you've\n\n- Sort within each group:\n  - a: archery, arlen\n  - b: barbudo, bride\n  - c: coquette\n  - l: lockwood, lucrative\n  - o: officious\n  - p: polytypy\n  - r: radix\n  - t: teem, tunnel\n  - y: you've\n\n- Combine the sorted groups:\n  - archery\n  - arlen\n  - barbudo\n  - bride\n  - coquette\n  - lockwood\n  - lucrative\n  - officious\n  - polytypy\n  - radix\n  - teem\n  - tunnel\n  - you've\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n\n<<<answer>>> archery, arlen, barbudo, bride, coquette, lockwood, lucrative, officious, polytypy, radix, teem, tunnel, you've <<<answer>>>"
