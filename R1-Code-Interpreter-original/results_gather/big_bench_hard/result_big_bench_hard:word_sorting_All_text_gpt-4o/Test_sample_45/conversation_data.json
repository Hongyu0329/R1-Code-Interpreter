    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted. The words given are:\n   - episode\n   - molybdenum\n   - schedule\n   - hen\n   - sparkman\n   - calabash\n   - marietta\n   - pedantic\n   - pounce\n   - vinaigrette\n   - berra\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although all words are already in lowercase, this step ensures consistency in comparison.\n\n3. **Compare Words Alphabetically**: We need to compare the words based on the alphabetical order of their letters. This involves comparing the first letter of each word, and if they are the same, moving to the next letter, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Using the alphabetical comparison, we sort the words. The order is determined by the position of each letter in the alphabet (A-Z).\n\n5. **List the Sorted Words**: After sorting, we list the words in their new order.\n\nLet's sort the words step by step:\n\n- Start with the first letter of each word:\n  - 'berra' starts with 'b'\n  - 'calabash' starts with 'c'\n  - 'episode' starts with 'e'\n  - 'hen' starts with 'h'\n  - 'marietta' starts with 'm'\n  - 'molybdenum' starts with 'm'\n  - 'pedantic' starts with 'p'\n  - 'pounce' starts with 'p'\n  - 'schedule' starts with 's'\n  - 'sparkman' starts with 's'\n  - 'vinaigrette' starts with 'v'\n\n- Arrange them in alphabetical order:\n  - berra\n  - calabash\n  - episode\n  - hen\n  - marietta\n  - molybdenum\n  - pedantic\n  - pounce\n  - schedule\n  - sparkman\n  - vinaigrette\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n\n<<<berra, calabash, episode, hen, marietta, molybdenum, pedantic, pounce, schedule, sparkman, vinaigrette>>>"
