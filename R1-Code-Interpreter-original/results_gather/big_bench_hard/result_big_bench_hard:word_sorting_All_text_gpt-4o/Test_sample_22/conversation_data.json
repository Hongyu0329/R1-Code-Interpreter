    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - shouldn't\n   - lorenz\n   - runneth\n   - skintight\n   - plastisol\n   - swept\n   - coven\n   - etruscan\n   - disturb\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although the words are already in lowercase, this step ensures uniformity when comparing words alphabetically.\n\n3. **Compare Alphabetically**: Compare the words based on the alphabetical order of their letters. The order is determined by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order based on the comparisons made in the previous step.\n\nLet's sort the words:\n\n- Start with the first letter of each word:\n  - c: coven\n  - d: disturb\n  - e: etruscan\n  - l: lorenz\n  - p: plastisol\n  - r: runneth\n  - s: shouldn't, skintight, swept\n\n- For words starting with 's', compare the second letter:\n  - h: shouldn't\n  - k: skintight\n  - w: swept\n\n5. **Final Sorted List**: After sorting, the words in alphabetical order are:\n   - coven\n   - disturb\n   - etruscan\n   - lorenz\n   - plastisol\n   - runneth\n   - shouldn't\n   - skintight\n   - swept\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> coven disturb etruscan lorenz plastisol runneth shouldn't skintight swept"
