    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - stephen\n   - amperage\n   - protocol\n   - crimea\n   - farther\n   - raillery\n   - tech\n   - insolent\n   - ping\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: Begin comparing the words based on the first letter. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word:\n     - 'a' in \"amperage\"\n     - 'c' in \"crimea\"\n     - 'f' in \"farther\"\n     - 'i' in \"insolent\"\n     - 'p' in \"ping\"\n     - 'p' in \"protocol\"\n     - 'r' in \"raillery\"\n     - 's' in \"stephen\"\n     - 't' in \"tech\"\n\n5. **Order the Words**:\n   - Words starting with 'a': amperage\n   - Words starting with 'c': crimea\n   - Words starting with 'f': farther\n   - Words starting with 'i': insolent\n   - Words starting with 'p': ping, protocol (compare the second letter 'i' in \"ping\" and 'r' in \"protocol\")\n   - Words starting with 'r': raillery\n   - Words starting with 's': stephen\n   - Words starting with 't': tech\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: Combine the words in the order determined above.\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n- amperage\n- crimea\n- farther\n- insolent\n- ping\n- protocol\n- raillery\n- stephen\n- tech\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<amperage, crimea, farther, insolent, ping, protocol, raillery, stephen, tech>>>"
