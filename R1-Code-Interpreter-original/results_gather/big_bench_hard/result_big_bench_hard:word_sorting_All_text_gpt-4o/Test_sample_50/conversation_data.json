    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start with the list of words provided: \"hat\", \"core\", \"sonnet\", \"discreet\".\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. For example, 'a' comes before 'b', 'b' comes before 'c', and so on.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: \n   - Compare the first letter of each word. If the first letters are different, the word with the letter that comes earlier in the alphabet is placed first.\n   - If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and continue this process until a difference is found.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**:\n   - Start by comparing the first letters of each word:\n     - \"hat\" starts with 'h'\n     - \"core\" starts with 'c'\n     - \"sonnet\" starts with 's'\n     - \"discreet\" starts with 'd'\n   - Order the words based on the first letter: 'c', 'd', 'h', 's'.\n   - This gives us the order: \"core\", \"discreet\", \"hat\", \"sonnet\".\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: Double-check each step to ensure the words are in the correct alphabetical order.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the correct alphabetical order of the words.\n\n<<<answer>>> core discreet hat sonnet <<<answer>>>"
