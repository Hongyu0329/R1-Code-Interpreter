    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - keller\n   - frame\n   - hippodrome\n   - bungle\n   - yolk\n   - anheuser\n   - prompt\n   - together\n   - spidery\n   - chaperon\n   - miterwort\n\n2. **Identify the First Letter**: Look at the first letter of each word to determine the initial order. Alphabetically, the order of the first letters is: a, b, c, f, h, k, m, p, s, t, y.\n\n3. **Sort by First Letter**: Arrange the words based on the first letter:\n   - anheuser\n   - bungle\n   - chaperon\n   - frame\n   - hippodrome\n   - keller\n   - miterwort\n   - prompt\n   - spidery\n   - together\n   - yolk\n\n4. **Sort by Subsequent Letters**: If two words start with the same letter, compare the subsequent letters to determine their order. In this list, no two words start with the same letter, so no further sorting is needed.\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: Double-check the list to ensure that all words are in the correct alphabetical order.\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n- anheuser\n- bungle\n- chaperon\n- frame\n- hippodrome\n- keller\n- miterwort\n- prompt\n- spidery\n- together\n- yolk\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> anheuser bungle chaperon frame hippodrome keller miterwort prompt spidery together yolk <<<answer>>>"
