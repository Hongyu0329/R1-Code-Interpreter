    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted:\n   - blutwurst\n   - horizon\n   - uranyl\n   - arraign\n   - portentous\n   - faber\n   - rancho\n   - peste\n   - glacier\n   - convenient\n   - inconspicuous\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: We will compare each word starting from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until we find a difference.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Sorting**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word.\n   - Identify the word that starts with the earliest letter in the alphabet.\n   - If multiple words start with the same letter, compare the second letter, and continue this process.\n   - Continue this process until all words are sorted.\n\n5. **Sorting Process**:\n   - The word starting with 'a' is \"arraign\".\n   - The word starting with 'b' is \"blutwurst\".\n   - The word starting with 'c' is \"convenient\".\n   - The word starting with 'f' is \"faber\".\n   - The word starting with 'g' is \"glacier\".\n   - The word starting with 'h' is \"horizon\".\n   - The word starting with 'i' is \"inconspicuous\".\n   - The word starting with 'p' is \"peste\".\n   - The word starting with 'p' is \"portentous\" (compare with \"peste\" and find \"peste\" comes first).\n   - The word starting with 'r' is \"rancho\".\n   - The word starting with 'u' is \"uranyl\".\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**:\n   - arraign\n   - blutwurst\n   - convenient\n   - faber\n   - glacier\n   - horizon\n   - inconspicuous\n   - peste\n   - portentous\n   - rancho\n   - uranyl\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<arraign, blutwurst, convenient, faber, glacier, horizon, inconspicuous, peste, portentous, rancho, uranyl>>>"
