    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words provided in the question:\n   - shreveport\n   - gamut\n   - berg\n   - multiplexor\n   - bluish\n   - puerto\n   - subliminal\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: Begin comparing the words based on their first letters:\n   - \"berg\" starts with 'b'\n   - \"bluish\" starts with 'b'\n   - \"gamut\" starts with 'g'\n   - \"multiplexor\" starts with 'm'\n   - \"puerto\" starts with 'p'\n   - \"shreveport\" starts with 's'\n   - \"subliminal\" starts with 's'\n\n4. **Sort by First Letter**: Arrange the words based on the first letter:\n   - Words starting with 'b': berg, bluish\n   - Words starting with 'g': gamut\n   - Words starting with 'm': multiplexor\n   - Words starting with 'p': puerto\n   - Words starting with 's': shreveport, subliminal\n\n5. **Sort Words with Same Initial Letter**: For words that start with the same letter, compare the subsequent letters:\n   - For 'b': Compare \"berg\" and \"bluish\". Since 'e' comes before 'l', \"berg\" comes before \"bluish\".\n   - For 's': Compare \"shreveport\" and \"subliminal\". Since 'h' comes before 'u', \"shreveport\" comes before \"subliminal\".\n\n6. **Compile the Sorted List**: Combine the sorted words into a final list:\n   - berg\n   - bluish\n   - gamut\n   - multiplexor\n   - puerto\n   - shreveport\n   - subliminal\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n\n<<<answer>>> berg bluish gamut multiplexor puerto shreveport subliminal"
