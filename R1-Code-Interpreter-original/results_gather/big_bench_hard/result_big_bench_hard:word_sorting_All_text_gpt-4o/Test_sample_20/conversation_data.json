    "To sort the given words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: We have three words to sort: \"slurp\", \"raytheon\", and \"gloucester\".\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**:\n   - \"slurp\" starts with 's'.\n   - \"raytheon\" starts with 'r'.\n   - \"gloucester\" starts with 'g'.\n\n4. **Determine Order by First Letter**:\n   - The letter 'g' comes before 'r' and 's' in the alphabet.\n   - The letter 'r' comes before 's' in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Order the Words**:\n   - \"gloucester\" should come first because 'g' is the earliest letter.\n   - \"raytheon\" should come second because 'r' is the next earliest letter.\n   - \"slurp\" should come last because 's' is the latest letter among the first letters of these words.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: Based on the above analysis, the words in alphabetical order are: \"gloucester\", \"raytheon\", \"slurp\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<gloucester, raytheon, slurp>>>"
