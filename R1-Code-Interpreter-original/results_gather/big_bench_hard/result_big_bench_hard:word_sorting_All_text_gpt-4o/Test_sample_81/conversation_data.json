    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - matte\n   - game\n   - aldebaran\n   - inkling\n   - fiberboard\n   - pulsate\n   - lakeside\n   - shape\n   - mcgee\n   - watchworks\n   - entrepreneurial\n   - boxwood\n   - peruse\n   - backyard\n   - cabbage\n   - polyhedra\n   - lightface\n   - rowley\n   - rae\n   - invincible\n\n2. **Sort the Words**: Sort the words alphabetically. This involves comparing the words letter by letter, starting from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n3. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive, as alphabetical order does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters.\n   - Pay attention to words that start with the same letter, as they need to be sorted based on subsequent letters.\n   - Ensure that all words are included in the final sorted list.\n\n4. **Sorted List**:\n   - aldebaran\n   - backyard\n   - boxwood\n   - cabbage\n   - entrepreneurial\n   - fiberboard\n   - game\n   - inkling\n   - invincible\n   - lakeside\n   - lightface\n   - matte\n   - mcgee\n   - peruse\n   - polyhedra\n   - pulsate\n   - rae\n   - rowley\n   - shape\n   - watchworks\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> aldebaran backyard boxwood cabbage entrepreneurial fiberboard game inkling invincible lakeside lightface matte mcgee peruse polyhedra pulsate rae rowley shape watchworks <<<answer>>>"
