    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - nv\n   - menlo\n   - boyd\n   - counterweight\n   - groove\n   - spumoni\n   - intangible\n   - sans\n   - ovipositor\n   - hide\n   - detergent\n   - besetting\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: Begin sorting the words by comparing them letter by letter.\n   - Start with the first letter of each word.\n   - If two words have the same first letter, compare the second letter, and continue this process until a difference is found.\n\n4. **Arrange the Words**: Based on the comparisons, arrange the words in alphabetical order.\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: Double-check the order to ensure that all words are correctly sorted.\n\nNow, let's sort the words:\n\n- Start with the first letter:\n  - b: boyd, besetting\n  - c: counterweight\n  - d: detergent\n  - g: groove\n  - h: hide\n  - i: intangible\n  - m: menlo\n  - n: nv\n  - o: ovipositor\n  - s: spumoni, sans\n\n- Sort words with the same first letter:\n  - b: besetting, boyd\n  - s: sans, spumoni\n\n- Combine all sorted words:\n  - besetting\n  - boyd\n  - counterweight\n  - detergent\n  - groove\n  - hide\n  - intangible\n  - menlo\n  - nv\n  - ovipositor\n  - sans\n  - spumoni\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n\n<<<answer>>> besetting, boyd, counterweight, detergent, groove, hide, intangible, menlo, nv, ovipositor, sans, spumoni <<<answer>>>"
