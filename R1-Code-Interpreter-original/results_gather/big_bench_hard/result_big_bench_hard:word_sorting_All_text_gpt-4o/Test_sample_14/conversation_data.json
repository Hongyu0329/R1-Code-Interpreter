    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words that need to be sorted:\n   - crowfoot\n   - scrupulous\n   - campfire\n   - contrast\n   - purgatory\n\n2. **Compare the Words**: Compare the words based on their alphabetical order. This involves comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n\n3. **Identify the First Word**: \n   - Compare the first letters: 'c' in crowfoot, 's' in scrupulous, 'c' in campfire, 'c' in contrast, 'p' in purgatory.\n   - The letter 'c' comes before 'p' and 's', so we focus on crowfoot, campfire, and contrast.\n   - Compare the second letters: 'r' in crowfoot, 'a' in campfire, 'o' in contrast.\n   - 'a' comes before 'o' and 'r', so campfire is the first word.\n\n4. **Identify the Second Word**:\n   - Now compare crowfoot and contrast.\n   - 'o' in contrast comes before 'r' in crowfoot, so contrast is the second word.\n\n5. **Identify the Third Word**:\n   - The remaining word starting with 'c' is crowfoot, so it is the third word.\n\n6. **Identify the Fourth Word**:\n   - Compare the remaining words: scrupulous and purgatory.\n   - 'p' in purgatory comes before 's' in scrupulous, so purgatory is the fourth word.\n\n7. **Identify the Fifth Word**:\n   - The remaining word is scrupulous, so it is the fifth word.\n\n8. **Compile the Sorted List**: \n   - The sorted list of words is: campfire, contrast, crowfoot, purgatory, scrupulous.\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> campfire, contrast, crowfoot, purgatory, scrupulous"
