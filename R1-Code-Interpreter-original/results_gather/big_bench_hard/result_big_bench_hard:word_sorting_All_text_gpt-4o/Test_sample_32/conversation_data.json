    "To sort the words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Words**: The words given are \"thunder,\" \"phase,\" and \"geld.\"\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare the Words**:\n   - Start by comparing the first letter of each word.\n   - The first letters are \"t\" (thunder), \"p\" (phase), and \"g\" (geld).\n   - In the English alphabet, \"g\" comes before \"p,\" and \"p\" comes before \"t.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Order**:\n   - Since \"g\" is the earliest letter, \"geld\" comes first.\n   - Next, \"p\" is the next earliest, so \"phase\" comes second.\n   - Finally, \"t\" is the latest, so \"thunder\" comes last.\n\n5. **List the Words in Order**: Based on the comparisons, the alphabetical order of the words is \"geld,\" \"phase,\" \"thunder.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> geld, phase, thunder"
