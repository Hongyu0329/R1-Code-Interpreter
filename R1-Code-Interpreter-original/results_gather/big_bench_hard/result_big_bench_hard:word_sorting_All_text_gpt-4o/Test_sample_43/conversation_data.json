    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start with the list of words provided: \n   - tuba\n   - synapse\n   - inaudible\n   - brewster\n   - tithing\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**: \n   - The first letters of the words are: t, s, i, b, t.\n   - In alphabetical order, the sequence is: b, i, s, t.\n\n4. **Sort by First Letter**: \n   - brewster (b)\n   - inaudible (i)\n   - synapse (s)\n   - tuba (t)\n   - tithing (t)\n\n5. **Compare Words with the Same First Letter**: \n   - For words starting with 't', compare the second letter:\n     - tuba (u)\n     - tithing (i)\n   - Since 'i' comes before 'u', tithing should come before tuba.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: \n   - brewster\n   - inaudible\n   - synapse\n   - tithing\n   - tuba\n\nBy following these steps, we have sorted the list of words alphabetically.\n\n<<<answer>>>brewster inaudible synapse tithing tuba<<<answer>>>"
