    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question:\n   - heterostructure\n   - bertrand\n   - careful\n   - wherewith\n   - libra\n   - eyelid\n   - feign\n   - southeastern\n   - paste\n   - snip\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: Begin sorting the words by comparing them letter by letter:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word.\n   - If two words start with the same letter, compare the second letter, and continue this process until the order is determined.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Sorting**:\n   - Compare \"heterostructure\" and \"bertrand\": \"b\" comes before \"h\", so \"bertrand\" comes first.\n   - Compare \"bertrand\" and \"careful\": \"b\" comes before \"c\", so \"bertrand\" remains first.\n   - Compare \"careful\" and \"eyelid\": \"c\" comes before \"e\", so \"careful\" comes next.\n   - Compare \"eyelid\" and \"feign\": \"e\" comes before \"f\", so \"eyelid\" comes next.\n   - Compare \"feign\" and \"heterostructure\": \"f\" comes before \"h\", so \"feign\" comes next.\n   - Compare \"heterostructure\" and \"libra\": \"h\" comes before \"l\", so \"heterostructure\" comes next.\n   - Compare \"libra\" and \"paste\": \"l\" comes before \"p\", so \"libra\" comes next.\n   - Compare \"paste\" and \"snip\": \"p\" comes before \"s\", so \"paste\" comes next.\n   - Compare \"snip\" and \"southeastern\": \"s\" is the same, so compare the second letter: \"n\" comes before \"o\", so \"snip\" comes next.\n   - Finally, \"southeastern\" and \"wherewith\": \"s\" comes before \"w\", so \"southeastern\" comes next, and \"wherewith\" is last.\n\n5. **Final Sorted List**:\n   - bertrand\n   - careful\n   - eyelid\n   - feign\n   - heterostructure\n   - libra\n   - paste\n   - snip\n   - southeastern\n   - wherewith\n\nThe words sorted alphabetically are:\n\n<<<answer>>> bertrand, careful, eyelid, feign, heterostructure, libra, paste, snip, southeastern, wherewith <<<answer>>>"
