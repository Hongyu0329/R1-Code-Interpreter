    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words that need to be sorted:\n   - walnut\n   - scoot\n   - jugoslavia\n   - retrorocket\n   - polyhedron\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. The order is from 'A' to 'Z'. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**: \n   - The first letters of the words are: w, s, j, r, p.\n   - In alphabetical order, these letters are: j, p, r, s, w.\n\n4. **Sort the Words by First Letter**:\n   - jugoslavia (j)\n   - polyhedron (p)\n   - retrorocket (r)\n   - scoot (s)\n   - walnut (w)\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: Double-check to ensure that the words are correctly sorted by comparing each word with the next one in the list:\n   - jugoslavia comes before polyhedron because 'j' comes before 'p'.\n   - polyhedron comes before retrorocket because 'p' comes before 'r'.\n   - retrorocket comes before scoot because 'r' comes before 's'.\n   - scoot comes before walnut because 's' comes before 'w'.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: The words in alphabetical order are:\n   - jugoslavia\n   - polyhedron\n   - retrorocket\n   - scoot\n   - walnut\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully sorted the list of words alphabetically.\n\n<<<answer>>>jugoslavia polyhedron retrorocket scoot walnut<<<answer>>>"
