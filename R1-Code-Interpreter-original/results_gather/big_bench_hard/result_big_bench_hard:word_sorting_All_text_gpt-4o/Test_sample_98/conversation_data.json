    "To sort the words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Words**: The words given in the list are \"deform\" and \"budd\".\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing two words, we start by comparing the first letter of each word. If they are the same, we move to the next letter, and so on, until we find a difference.\n\n3. **Compare the Words**:\n   - Compare the first letters of each word: \"d\" in \"deform\" and \"b\" in \"budd\".\n   - The letter \"b\" comes before \"d\" in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Determine the Order**: Since \"b\" comes before \"d\", the word \"budd\" should come before \"deform\" in alphabetical order.\n\n5. **List the Words in Order**: Based on the comparison, the correct alphabetical order of the words is:\n   - \"budd\"\n   - \"deform\"\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the correct alphabetical order of the given words.\n\n<<<answer>>> budd, deform"
