    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted:\n   - underclassmen\n   - pegging\n   - dale\n   - bartok\n   - goat\n   - martinson\n   - whoop\n   - badinage\n   - brunswick\n   - fraternity\n   - allele\n   - dar\n   - yourselves\n   - dun\n   - anthropocentric\n   - banish\n   - starkey\n   - morphemic\n   - monomer\n   - desolater\n\n2. **Sort the Words**: Next, we sort these words alphabetically. This involves comparing the words letter by letter, starting from the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until we can determine the order.\n\n3. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive, as all words are in lowercase.\n   - Pay attention to words that may have similar starting letters but differ later on.\n   - Double-check the list to ensure no words are missed or duplicated.\n\n4. **Sorted List**:\n   - allele\n   - anthropocentric\n   - badinage\n   - banish\n   - bartok\n   - brunswick\n   - dale\n   - dar\n   - desolater\n   - dun\n   - fraternity\n   - goat\n   - martinson\n   - monomer\n   - morphemic\n   - pegging\n   - starkey\n   - underclassmen\n   - whoop\n   - yourselves\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> allele, anthropocentric, badinage, banish, bartok, brunswick, dale, dar, desolater, dun, fraternity, goat, martinson, monomer, morphemic, pegging, starkey, underclassmen, whoop, yourselves <<<answer>>>"
