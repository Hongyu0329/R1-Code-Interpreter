    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start with the list of words provided: \"ecosystem\", \"cloudy\", \"ferret\", \"knotty\".\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. Words are compared letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**: \n   - \"cloudy\" starts with 'c'\n   - \"ecosystem\" starts with 'e'\n   - \"ferret\" starts with 'f'\n   - \"knotty\" starts with 'k'\n\n   In alphabetical order, 'c' comes before 'e', 'e' comes before 'f', and 'f' comes before 'k'.\n\n4. **Order the Words by First Letter**: Based on the first letter, the order is:\n   - \"cloudy\"\n   - \"ecosystem\"\n   - \"ferret\"\n   - \"knotty\"\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: Ensure that each word is in the correct position by comparing the first letters. Since no two words start with the same letter, no further comparison is needed.\n\n6. **Final Ordered List**: The words in alphabetical order are:\n   - \"cloudy\"\n   - \"ecosystem\"\n   - \"ferret\"\n   - \"knotty\"\n\nBy following these steps, we have sorted the words alphabetically.\n\n<<<answer>>> cloudy, ecosystem, ferret, knotty <<<answer>>>"
