    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to have a clear list of all the words provided:\n   - statutory\n   - feed\n   - spavin\n   - hecatomb\n   - pestle\n   - plume\n   - figural\n   - pasty\n   - giveth\n   - incense\n   - undulate\n   - middle\n   - blackstone\n   - tel\n   - obstinacy\n   - toothpaste\n   - hunt\n   - sinkhole\n\n2. **Sort Alphabetically**: We will sort these words in alphabetical order. This involves comparing the words based on the order of letters in the English alphabet. The process is as follows:\n   - Compare the first letter of each word.\n   - If the first letters are the same, compare the second letters, and so on.\n   - Continue this process until the list is sorted.\n\n3. **Careful Points**:\n   - Ensure that all words are compared in a case-insensitive manner, as alphabetical sorting is typically case-insensitive.\n   - Double-check for any words that might have similar starting letters and ensure they are sorted correctly based on subsequent letters.\n\n4. **Sorted List**:\n   - blackstone\n   - feed\n   - figural\n   - giveth\n   - hecatomb\n   - hunt\n   - incense\n   - middle\n   - obstinacy\n   - pasty\n   - pestle\n   - plume\n   - sinkhole\n   - spavin\n   - statutory\n   - tel\n   - toothpaste\n   - undulate\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\n<<<answer>>> blackstone, feed, figural, giveth, hecatomb, hunt, incense, middle, obstinacy, pasty, pestle, plume, sinkhole, spavin, statutory, tel, toothpaste, undulate <<<answer>>>"
