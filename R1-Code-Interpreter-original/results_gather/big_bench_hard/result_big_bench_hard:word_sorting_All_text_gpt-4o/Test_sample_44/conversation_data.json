    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted. The words given are:\n   - wintertime\n   - mobster\n   - ugh\n   - brown\n   - fleabane\n   - longish\n   - ipsilateral\n   - cortex\n   - hair\n   - diminutive\n   - trapezoidal\n   - guy\n   - richfield\n   - highfalutin\n   - borough\n   - foot\n   - delphinium\n   - cosec\n   - abstract\n\n2. **Sort Alphabetically**: To sort the words alphabetically, we compare the words based on the order of letters in the English alphabet. We start by comparing the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until we find a difference.\n\n3. **Sorting Process**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word.\n   - Arrange the words in order based on the first letter.\n   - If two words have the same first letter, compare the second letter, and continue this process until the words are sorted.\n\n4. **Sorted List**:\n   - abstract\n   - borough\n   - brown\n   - cosec\n   - cortex\n   - delphinium\n   - diminutive\n   - fleabane\n   - foot\n   - guy\n   - hair\n   - highfalutin\n   - ipsilateral\n   - longish\n   - mobster\n   - richfield\n   - trapezoidal\n   - ugh\n   - wintertime\n\n5. **Final Answer**: After sorting the words alphabetically, we present the final sorted list.\n\n<<<answer>>> abstract borough brown cosec cortex delphinium diminutive fleabane foot guy hair highfalutin ipsilateral longish mobster richfield trapezoidal ugh wintertime"
