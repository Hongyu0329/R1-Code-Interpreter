    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question.\n   - gentle\n   - boletus\n   - galveston\n   - aniline\n   - eddy\n   - fontainebleau\n   - wile\n   - scandalous\n   - skat\n   - sportsmen\n\n2. **Convert to Lowercase**: Although the words are already in lowercase, ensure that all words are treated uniformly in lowercase to avoid any case sensitivity issues.\n\n3. **Compare Words Alphabetically**: Compare the words based on the alphabetical order of their letters. The order is determined by the position of each letter in the alphabet (a, b, c, ..., z).\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order by comparing each word from the beginning to the end. If two words start with the same letter, compare the next letter, and so on.\n\n5. **List the Sorted Words**: After sorting, list the words in their new order.\n\nLet's sort the words step by step:\n\n- Start with the first letter of each word:\n  - a: aniline\n  - b: boletus\n  - e: eddy\n  - f: fontainebleau\n  - g: galveston, gentle\n  - s: scandalous, skat, sportsmen\n  - w: wile\n\n- Now, sort the words that start with the same letter:\n  - g: galveston, gentle (galveston comes before gentle)\n  - s: scandalous, skat, sportsmen (scandalous comes before skat, and skat comes before sportsmen)\n\n- Combine all the sorted words into a final list.\n\nThe final sorted list is:\n1. aniline\n2. boletus\n3. eddy\n4. fontainebleau\n5. galveston\n6. gentle\n7. scandalous\n8. skat\n9. sportsmen\n10. wile\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> aniline boletus eddy fontainebleau galveston gentle scandalous skat sportsmen wile <<<answer>>>"
