    "To sort the words alphabetically, we need to compare each word based on the order of letters in the English alphabet. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the words to be sorted**: The words given are \"oblong,\" \"bucolic,\" and \"whoosh.\"\n\n2. **Compare the first letters of each word**:\n   - \"oblong\" starts with 'o'\n   - \"bucolic\" starts with 'b'\n   - \"whoosh\" starts with 'w'\n\n3. **Determine the alphabetical order of the first letters**:\n   - In the English alphabet, 'b' comes before 'o', and 'o' comes before 'w'.\n   - Therefore, based on the first letters, the order is: \"bucolic,\" \"oblong,\" \"whoosh.\"\n\n4. **Verify the order**:\n   - Since the first letters are different for each word, we do not need to compare the subsequent letters.\n\n5. **List the words in alphabetical order**:\n   - \"bucolic\"\n   - \"oblong\"\n   - \"whoosh\"\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> bucolic oblong whoosh"
