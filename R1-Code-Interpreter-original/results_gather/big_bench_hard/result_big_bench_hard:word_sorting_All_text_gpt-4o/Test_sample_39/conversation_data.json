    "To sort the words \"broaden\" and \"envy\" alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Words**: We have two words to sort: \"broaden\" and \"envy\".\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**: \n   - The first letter of \"broaden\" is 'b'.\n   - The first letter of \"envy\" is 'e'.\n\n4. **Determine Order Based on First Letters**: \n   - In the English alphabet, 'b' comes before 'e'. Therefore, \"broaden\" should come before \"envy\" when sorted alphabetically.\n\n5. **Final Order**: Since \"broaden\" comes before \"envy\" based on the first letter comparison, the sorted order of the words is:\n   - \"broaden\"\n   - \"envy\"\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the correct alphabetical order of the given words.\n\n<<<broaden envy>>>"
