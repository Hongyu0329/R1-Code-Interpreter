    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted:\n   - tipoff\n   - fructose\n   - coleus\n   - hurricane\n   - cite\n   - tularemia\n   - irreducible\n   - wier\n   - improbable\n   - whitetail\n   - vesper\n   - whereabout\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: We will compare each word starting from the first letter. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until we find a difference.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Sorting**:\n   - Start with the first letters: c, f, c, h, c, t, i, w, i, w, v, w.\n   - The words starting with 'c' are: coleus, cite.\n   - The words starting with 'f' are: fructose.\n   - The words starting with 'h' are: hurricane.\n   - The words starting with 'i' are: irreducible, improbable.\n   - The words starting with 't' are: tipoff, tularemia.\n   - The words starting with 'v' are: vesper.\n   - The words starting with 'w' are: wier, whitetail, whereabout.\n\n5. **Order the Words**:\n   - Among the 'c' words: cite comes before coleus.\n   - Among the 'i' words: improbable comes before irreducible.\n   - Among the 't' words: tipoff comes before tularemia.\n   - Among the 'w' words: whereabout comes before whitetail, which comes before wier.\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**:\n   - cite\n   - coleus\n   - fructose\n   - hurricane\n   - improbable\n   - irreducible\n   - tipoff\n   - tularemia\n   - vesper\n   - whereabout\n   - whitetail\n   - wier\n\nThe final answer, with the words sorted alphabetically, is:\n\n<<<answer>>> cite, coleus, fructose, hurricane, improbable, irreducible, tipoff, tularemia, vesper, whereabout, whitetail, wier <<<answer>>>"
