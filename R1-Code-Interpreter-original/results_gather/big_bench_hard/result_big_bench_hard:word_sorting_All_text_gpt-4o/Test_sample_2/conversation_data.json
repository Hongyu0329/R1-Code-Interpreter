    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: First, we need to clearly list all the words that need to be sorted. The words given are:\n   - vegetate\n   - artillery\n   - harm\n   - fda\n   - doris\n   - prosody\n   - bainite\n   - incongruous\n   - monkey\n   - vivian\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Sort the Words**: We will compare the words based on their first letter. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n   - Start with the first letters:\n     - a: artillery\n     - b: bainite\n     - d: doris\n     - f: fda\n     - h: harm\n     - i: incongruous\n     - m: monkey\n     - p: prosody\n     - v: vegetate, vivian\n\n4. **Order the Words**: Now, we order the words based on the first letter and then continue with the subsequent letters if needed:\n   - artillery (a)\n   - bainite (b)\n   - doris (d)\n   - fda (f)\n   - harm (h)\n   - incongruous (i)\n   - monkey (m)\n   - prosody (p)\n   - vegetate (v)\n   - vivian (v)\n\n5. **Final Check**: Ensure that all words are included and correctly ordered.\n\nThe final sorted list of words is:\n- artillery\n- bainite\n- doris\n- fda\n- harm\n- incongruous\n- monkey\n- prosody\n- vegetate\n- vivian\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> artillery bainite doris fda harm incongruous monkey prosody vegetate vivian <<<answer>>>"
