    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing all the words provided in the question:\n   - mohawk\n   - thebes\n   - supercilious\n   - celandine\n   - faith\n   - hostile\n   - harold\n   - diploma\n   - octavia\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare Words**: Begin comparing the words based on the first letter. If the first letters are the same, move to the second letter, and so on.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**:\n   - Start with the first letter of each word:\n     - c: celandine\n     - d: diploma\n     - f: faith\n     - h: harold, hostile\n     - m: mohawk\n     - o: octavia\n     - s: supercilious\n     - t: thebes\n\n5. **Resolve Ties**: For words starting with the same letter, compare the subsequent letters:\n   - Between \"harold\" and \"hostile\", compare the second letter:\n     - \"a\" in \"harold\" comes before \"o\" in \"hostile\".\n\n6. **Final Sorted List**: Arrange the words in alphabetical order:\n   - celandine\n   - diploma\n   - faith\n   - harold\n   - hostile\n   - mohawk\n   - octavia\n   - supercilious\n   - thebes\n\n7. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the specified format.\n\n<<<answer>>> celandine diploma faith harold hostile mohawk octavia supercilious thebes <<<answer>>>"
