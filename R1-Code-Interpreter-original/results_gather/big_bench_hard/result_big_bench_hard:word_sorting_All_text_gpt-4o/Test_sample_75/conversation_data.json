    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words provided in the question:\n   - tiresome\n   - sweepstake\n   - introvert\n   - carport\n   - firewood\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**: \n   - The first letters of the words are: t (tiresome), s (sweepstake), i (introvert), c (carport), f (firewood).\n   - In alphabetical order, the sequence is: c, f, i, s, t.\n\n4. **Sort the Words**: Based on the first letters, we can start sorting the words:\n   - The word starting with 'c' is \"carport\".\n   - The word starting with 'f' is \"firewood\".\n   - The word starting with 'i' is \"introvert\".\n   - The word starting with 's' is \"sweepstake\".\n   - The word starting with 't' is \"tiresome\".\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: Ensure that the words are in the correct alphabetical order:\n   - carport\n   - firewood\n   - introvert\n   - sweepstake\n   - tiresome\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\n<<<answer>>> carport firewood introvert sweepstake tiresome"
