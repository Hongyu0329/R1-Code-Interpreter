    "To sort the given words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: The words provided are:\n   - indifferent\n   - trainman\n   - bootlegging\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the position of letters in the alphabet. We compare words letter by letter from left to right.\n\n3. **Compare the First Letters**:\n   - The first letters of the words are:\n     - indifferent: 'i'\n     - trainman: 't'\n     - bootlegging: 'b'\n   - In the alphabet, 'b' comes before 'i', and 'i' comes before 't'.\n\n4. **Determine the Order**:\n   - Since 'b' comes first, \"bootlegging\" is the first word.\n   - Next, 'i' comes before 't', so \"indifferent\" is the second word.\n   - Finally, \"trainman\" is the last word.\n\n5. **Final Sorted Order**:\n   - bootlegging\n   - indifferent\n   - trainman\n\nBy following these steps, we have sorted the words alphabetically.\n\n<<<answer>>> bootlegging indifferent trainman"
