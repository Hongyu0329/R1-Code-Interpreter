    "To sort the given list of words alphabetically, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the Words**: Start by listing the words that need to be sorted:\n   - dateline\n   - jill\n   - langmuir\n   - pipette\n   - household\n\n2. **Understand Alphabetical Order**: Alphabetical order is determined by the sequence of letters in the English alphabet. When comparing words, we start with the first letter of each word. If the first letters are the same, we move to the second letter, and so on, until a difference is found.\n\n3. **Compare the Words**: \n   - Start by comparing the first letters of each word:\n     - 'dateline' starts with 'd'\n     - 'jill' starts with 'j'\n     - 'langmuir' starts with 'l'\n     - 'pipette' starts with 'p'\n     - 'household' starts with 'h'\n   - Arrange these based on the alphabetical order of their first letters: d, h, j, l, p.\n\n4. **Order the Words**: Based on the first letter comparison, the order is:\n   - dateline\n   - household\n   - jill\n   - langmuir\n   - pipette\n\n5. **Verify the Order**: Double-check to ensure that each word is in the correct position based on the alphabetical order of their first letters. Since there are no words with the same starting letter, no further comparison is needed.\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer**: Present the sorted list in the required format.\n\n<<<answer>>> dateline household jill langmuir pipette <<<answer>>>"
