    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"Why would they have weapons drawn when they've been called to the scene of a fire?\"\n   - This statement implies that it is unusual or unnecessary for someone to have weapons drawn at a fire scene. Typically, a fire scene would require firefighters and not armed personnel. The sarcasm here could be in highlighting the absurdity of having weapons in a situation where they are not needed.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"Why would they have weapons drawn when they've been called to the scene of a shooting?\"\n   - In this case, having weapons drawn at the scene of a shooting is more expected and logical. The presence of weapons in a potentially dangerous situation like a shooting is understandable. Therefore, this statement is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns with the expected response.\n\nGiven this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it points out the incongruity of having weapons at a fire scene, which is not a typical or logical response.\n\n<<<A>>>"
