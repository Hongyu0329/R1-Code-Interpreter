    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the content of each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is meant, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"That's only about $0.15 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs.\"\n- $0.15 per mile is a relatively low and reasonable cost for fuel. The statement aligns with the expectation of what is considered reasonable, so it is likely not sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs.\"\n- $10 per mile is an extremely high and unreasonable cost for fuel. The statement claims this is \"perfectly reasonable,\" which is contrary to the expectation. This contradiction suggests sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is likely the sarcastic statement because it presents an unreasonable cost as if it were reasonable, which is a common form of sarcasm.\n\n<<<(B) That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs>>>"
