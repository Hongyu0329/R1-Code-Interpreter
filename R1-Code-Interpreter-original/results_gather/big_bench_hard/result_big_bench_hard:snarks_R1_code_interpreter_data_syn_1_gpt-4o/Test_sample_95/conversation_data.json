    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be Asus's fault that it broke down.\"\n   - This statement implies that the speaker is blaming the laptop manufacturer (Asus) for the laptop's failure after being submerged underwater. The sarcasm here lies in the absurdity of blaming the manufacturer for a situation where the user clearly misused the product.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be my fault that it broke down.\"\n   - This statement seems to be a straightforward admission of fault. The speaker acknowledges that bringing a laptop underwater is an inappropriate use, leading to its breakdown. There is no sarcasm here as the statement aligns with logical reasoning.\n\nGiven this analysis, statement (A) is sarcastic because it uses irony to highlight the absurdity of blaming the manufacturer for a misuse of the product.\n\n<<<(A) My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be Asus's fault that it broke down>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be Asus's fault that it broke down\n(B) My laptop didn't work when I brought it underwater, therefore it must be my fault that it broke down\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
