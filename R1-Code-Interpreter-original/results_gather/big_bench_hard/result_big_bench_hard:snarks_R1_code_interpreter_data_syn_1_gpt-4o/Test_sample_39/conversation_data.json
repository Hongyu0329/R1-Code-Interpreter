    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"An NFL Head coach with a losing record that hasn't been on a field in ten years? This is gonna go great.\"\n- The statement starts by highlighting negative aspects: a losing record and a long absence from the field. The phrase \"This is gonna go great\" is positive, but given the context, it seems to contradict the negative setup, suggesting sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"An NFL Head coach with a losing record that hasn't been on a field in ten years? This is gonna go terribly.\"\n- This statement also highlights the same negative aspects. The phrase \"This is gonna go terribly\" aligns with the negative setup, suggesting a straightforward, non-sarcastic statement.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is likely sarcastic because it uses a positive phrase in a context that suggests a negative outcome, creating an ironic contrast.\n\n<<<A>>>"
