    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the language used in both options. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic tone.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"But his eyes were on the ball, shouldn't be a red\"\n- This statement suggests that the player was focused on the ball, implying that there was no foul play. The phrase \"shouldn't be a red\" suggests that the speaker believes a red card is not warranted. This could be a straightforward statement or sarcastic, depending on the context.\n\n(B) \"But his cleats were on the ball, shouldn't be a red\"\n- This statement is more likely to be sarcastic. The phrase \"his cleats were on the ball\" implies that the player made a physical and potentially dangerous contact with the ball using his cleats, which could be considered a foul. Saying \"shouldn't be a red\" in this context could be sarcastic, as the speaker might actually mean that it should be a red card due to the dangerous play.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses irony by suggesting that a potentially dangerous action (using cleats on the ball) should not be penalized, which is contrary to what one would expect in a fair play scenario.\n\n<<<(B) But his cleats were on the ball, shouldn't be a red>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) But his eyes were on the ball, shouldn't be a red\n(B) But his cleats were on the ball, shouldn't be a red\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
