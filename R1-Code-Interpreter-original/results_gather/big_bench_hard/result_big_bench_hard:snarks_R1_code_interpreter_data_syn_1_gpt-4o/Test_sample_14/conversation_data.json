    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical sentiment associated with the activity described. \n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - Working in retail often involves repetitive and mundane tasks. Pushing a trolley of returns around the store to put them back is generally considered a tedious and unenjoyable task.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Statements:**\n   - **Statement (A):** \"One of the worst things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back.\"\n     - This statement aligns with the common perception that such a task is unpleasant. It is straightforward and likely not sarcastic.\n   - **Statement (B):** \"One of the enjoyable things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back.\"\n     - This statement contradicts the typical sentiment associated with the task. Describing a generally unpleasant task as enjoyable suggests sarcasm.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Statement (B) is likely sarcastic because it describes a typically unenjoyable task as enjoyable, which is contrary to the common experience.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(B) One of the enjoyable things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back>>>"
