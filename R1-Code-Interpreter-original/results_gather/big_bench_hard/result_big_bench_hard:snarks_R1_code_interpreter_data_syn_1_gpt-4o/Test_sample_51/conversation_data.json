    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Oh, it's not happened before? I guess it must not be in the lawbooks then.\"\n- This statement implies that just because something hasn't happened before, it isn't documented in the lawbooks. The use of \"I guess\" suggests a level of disbelief or irony, as laws are typically written regardless of whether an event has occurred before. This could be interpreted as sarcastic because the speaker is likely aware that laws exist even for unprecedented events.\n\n(B) \"Oh, it's not happened before? I guess it must not be against the lawbooks then.\"\n- This statement implies that if something hasn't happened before, it must not be against the law. Similar to option A, the use of \"I guess\" indicates a level of irony or disbelief. However, this statement seems less sarcastic because it could be interpreted more literally; if something hasn't happened, it might not have been considered in the law.\n\nGiven this analysis, option (A) seems more sarcastic because it mocks the idea that laws are only written for events that have already occurred, which is an ironic and unlikely scenario.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
