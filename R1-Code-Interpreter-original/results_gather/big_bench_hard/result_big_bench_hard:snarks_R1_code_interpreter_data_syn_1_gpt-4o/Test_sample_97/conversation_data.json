    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the connotations of the words used in each option.\n\n1. **Option (A): \"Just like Hitler. A True warrior\"**\n   - The term \"warrior\" generally has a positive connotation, implying bravery, strength, and honor. However, when used in the context of Hitler, who is widely regarded as a dictator responsible for horrific war crimes and genocide, the term \"warrior\" could be seen as sarcastic. It implies a positive trait in a context where it is not deserved, thus creating a contrast that is often used in sarcasm.\n\n2. **Option (B): \"Just like Hitler. A True demagogue\"**\n   - The term \"demagogue\" refers to a leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument. This term is often used negatively and is more fitting to describe Hitler's style of leadership. Therefore, this statement is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns with the negative perception of Hitler.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses a term with a positive connotation in a context where it is not appropriate, creating a contrast that is characteristic of sarcasm.\n\n<<<(A) Just like Hitler. A True warrior>>>"
