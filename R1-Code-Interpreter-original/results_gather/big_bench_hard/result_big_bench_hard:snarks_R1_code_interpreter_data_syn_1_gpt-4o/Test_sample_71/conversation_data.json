    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in each option. Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that implies the opposite of what is literally being said, often for humorous or emphatic effect.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Wow, you only applied to 200 internships this past week?\"\n- Applying to 200 internships in a week is an unusually high number. The use of \"only\" here suggests that the speaker is implying the opposite of what is literally being said. It is unlikely that someone would genuinely consider 200 applications as \"only,\" which indicates sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"Wow, you only applied to 2 internships this past week?\"\n- Applying to 2 internships in a week is a reasonable and realistic number. The use of \"only\" here is more likely to be taken literally, as 2 is indeed a small number compared to 200. This statement is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses exaggeration and the word \"only\" to imply the opposite of what is being said.\n\n<<<(A) Wow, you only applied to 200 internships this past week?>>>"
