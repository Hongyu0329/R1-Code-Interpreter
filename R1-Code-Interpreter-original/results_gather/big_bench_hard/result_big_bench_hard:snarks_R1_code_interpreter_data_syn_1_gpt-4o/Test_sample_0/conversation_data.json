    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the tone of each statement.\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"He's a generous person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\"\n   - This statement appears to be straightforward and sincere. It describes someone as generous and aligns their actions (promoting a charity stream) with that description. There is no apparent contradiction or irony.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\"\n   - This statement contains a contradiction. It describes someone as a \"terrible person\" but then mentions their involvement in a positive action (promoting a charity stream that helps kids). The juxtaposition of calling someone terrible while they are doing something good suggests sarcasm. The speaker might not genuinely believe the person is terrible, or they might be highlighting a perceived hypocrisy or irony.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement B is likely to be sarcastic because it uses irony by contrasting a negative description with a positive action.\n\n<<<(B) He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need>>>"
