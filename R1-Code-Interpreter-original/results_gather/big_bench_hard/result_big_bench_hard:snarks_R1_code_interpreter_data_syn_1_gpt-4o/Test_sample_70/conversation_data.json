    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and the logical consistency of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n(A) \"Calling a whole electorate 'morons' because they don't share the same political beliefs as you is a terrible way to win them over.\"\n- This statement is straightforward and logically consistent. It suggests that insulting people is not an effective strategy to gain their support, which aligns with common sense.\n\n(B) \"Calling a whole electorate 'morons' because they don't share the same political beliefs as you is a great way to win them over.\"\n- This statement is likely sarcastic. It suggests that insulting people is an effective strategy to gain their support, which is contrary to common sense and is likely intended to be ironic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally stated.\n\n<<<(B) Calling a whole electorate 'morons' because they don't share the same political beliefs as you is a great way to win them over>>>"
