    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much happier if we never did anything for anyone ever.\"\n- This statement implies that the speaker does not actually believe the person would be happier by not helping others. The use of \"Yeah, I'm sure\" suggests a sarcastic tone, as it is unlikely that not helping others would lead to happiness.\n\n(B) \"Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much lonelier if we never did anything for anyone ever.\"\n- This statement suggests that not helping others would lead to loneliness, which is a logical consequence. The tone here does not necessarily imply sarcasm, as it aligns with the expected outcome of not engaging with others.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses irony to suggest the opposite of what is expected (i.e., not helping others would make someone happier).\n\n<<<(A) Yeah, I'm sure you'd be so much happier if we never did anything for anyone ever>>>"
