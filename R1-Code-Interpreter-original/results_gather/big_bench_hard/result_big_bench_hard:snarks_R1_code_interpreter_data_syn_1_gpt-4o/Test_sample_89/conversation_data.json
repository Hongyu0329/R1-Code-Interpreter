    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"I'm headed to college within a year expecting barely any income during that time. Removing tax breaks for students will be helpful, right?\"\n\n   - **Literal Meaning:** The speaker is going to college soon and expects to have little income. They mention that removing tax breaks for students will be helpful.\n   - **Implied Meaning:** Given the context, removing tax breaks for students would not be helpful for someone with little income. Therefore, the statement is likely sarcastic, as it implies the opposite of what is literally stated.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"I'm headed to college within a year expecting barely any income during that time. Adding tax breaks for students will be helpful, right?\"\n\n   - **Literal Meaning:** The speaker is going to college soon and expects to have little income. They mention that adding tax breaks for students will be helpful.\n   - **Implied Meaning:** This statement aligns with the expectation that tax breaks would indeed be helpful for someone with little income. Therefore, it is likely not sarcastic.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement (A) is sarcastic because it suggests that removing tax breaks would be helpful, which is contrary to the expected benefit for a student with low income.\n\n<<<(A)>>>"
