    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical usage of the words in each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is the opposite of what one actually means, often for humorous or emphatic effect.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Working the printer is too complex for me\"\n- Printers are generally considered to be simple devices to operate, especially in comparison to more complex technology. Saying that working a printer is too complex could be sarcastic, implying that the speaker actually finds it very simple but is exaggerating the difficulty for effect.\n\n(B) \"Working the microprocessor is too complex for me\"\n- Microprocessors are indeed complex devices, and working with them typically requires specialized knowledge. Saying that working a microprocessor is too complex is likely a straightforward statement of fact rather than sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it involves exaggerating the difficulty of a task that is generally considered simple.\n\n<<<answer A) Working the printer is too complex for me>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Working the printer is too complex for me\n(B) Working the microprocessor is too complex for me\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
