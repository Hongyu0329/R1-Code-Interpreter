    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"I love it when people mock other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy.\"\n- The statement suggests that mocking someone for trying to improve their health is \"classy.\" However, mocking is generally considered rude or disrespectful, not classy. Therefore, the speaker is likely being sarcastic, implying that mocking is not classy at all.\n\n(B) \"I love it when people encourage other people for trying to get healthier. It's so classy.\"\n- Encouraging someone for trying to get healthier is generally seen as a positive and supportive action. Describing it as \"classy\" aligns with the positive nature of encouragement. Therefore, this statement is likely sincere and not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally said.\n\n<<<A>>>"
