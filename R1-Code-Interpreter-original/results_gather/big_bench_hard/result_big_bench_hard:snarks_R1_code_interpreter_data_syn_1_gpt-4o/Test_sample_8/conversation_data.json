    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical connotations associated with the activities mentioned in each statement.\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"Yeah, I've noticed he's been drinking every day recently, what a great transformation\"\n   - Drinking every day is generally considered a negative habit, often associated with potential health issues or addiction. The phrase \"what a great transformation\" is typically used to describe positive changes. Therefore, the juxtaposition of a negative habit with a positive phrase suggests sarcasm.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"Yeah, I've noticed he's been exercising every day recently, what a great transformation\"\n   - Exercising every day is generally seen as a positive habit, associated with health and well-being. The phrase \"what a great transformation\" aligns with the positive nature of exercising regularly. Therefore, this statement is likely sincere and not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement A is the one that is sarcastic because it uses a positive phrase to describe a negative behavior, which is a common form of sarcasm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
