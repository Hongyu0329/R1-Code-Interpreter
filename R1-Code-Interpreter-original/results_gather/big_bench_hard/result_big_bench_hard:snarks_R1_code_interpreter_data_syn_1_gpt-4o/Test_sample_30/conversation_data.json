    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"So he's planning to continue leaving useless space junk in orbit literally just because he can. What a horrible person.\"\n- This statement seems straightforward and critical. The speaker is directly expressing disapproval of the person's actions by calling them a \"horrible person.\" There is no indication of sarcasm here, as the statement aligns with the negative sentiment expressed.\n\n(B) \"So he's planning to continue leaving useless space junk in orbit literally just because he can. What a brilliant person.\"\n- This statement appears to be sarcastic. The speaker describes the action of leaving space junk as \"brilliant,\" which is likely the opposite of what they truly believe. The use of \"brilliant\" in this context is likely intended to mock or criticize the person's actions, suggesting that the speaker actually finds the behavior foolish or irresponsible.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey criticism.\n\n<<<(B) So he's planning to continue leaving useless space junk in orbit literally just because he can. What a brilliant person>>>"
