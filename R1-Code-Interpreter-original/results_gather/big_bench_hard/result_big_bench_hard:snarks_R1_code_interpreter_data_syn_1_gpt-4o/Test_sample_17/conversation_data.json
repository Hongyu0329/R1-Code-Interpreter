    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Welp, my $1000 dollar phone has bad battery life, guess I'll just have to return it.\"\n   - This statement seems straightforward. If a product is not satisfactory, returning it is a logical and reasonable action. There is no apparent contradiction or exaggeration in this statement, so it doesn't seem sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Welp, my $1000 dollar phone has bad battery life, guess I'll just have to dumpster it.\"\n   - This statement implies that the speaker is considering throwing away a very expensive phone due to its bad battery life. The action of throwing away a $1000 phone is exaggerated and not a typical response to such a problem. This exaggeration and the implied absurdity suggest sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it involves an exaggerated and unlikely action in response to the problem described.\n\n<<<(B) Welp, my $1000 dollar phone has bad battery life, guess I'll just have to dumpster it>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Welp, my $1000 dollar phone has bad battery life, guess I'll just have to return it\n(B) Welp, my $1000 dollar phone has bad battery life, guess I'll just have to dumpster it\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
