    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is the opposite of what is meant, usually in a humorous or mocking way.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) \"We should start a petition to ban breathing\" - This statement is likely sarcastic because breathing is a fundamental and necessary biological process for life. Suggesting to ban something essential and natural is absurd, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"We should start a petition to ban vaping\" - This statement could be taken literally, as there are genuine health concerns associated with vaping, and some people might seriously consider banning it. Therefore, it is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it suggests an absurd action that contradicts common sense.\n\n<<<(A) We should start a petition to ban breathing>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) We should start a petition to ban breathing\n(B) We should start a petition to ban vaping\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
