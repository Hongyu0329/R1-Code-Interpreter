    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the tone of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"You mean your team did the most damage, then you just did the final blow. Amazing display of team skill.\"\n- This statement seems to genuinely praise the team effort, as it acknowledges the team's contribution to the damage and the final blow. The phrase \"Amazing display of team skill\" aligns with the context of teamwork.\n\n(B) \"You mean your team did the most damage, then you just did the final blow. Amazing display of individual skill.\"\n- This statement, on the other hand, seems to be sarcastic. It acknowledges the team's effort but then ironically praises the individual for the final blow, which contradicts the idea of individual skill since the team did most of the work.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is likely the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to highlight the contrast between the team's effort and the individual's final action.\n\n<<<(B) You mean your team did the most damage, then you just did the final blow. Amazing display of individual skill>>>"
