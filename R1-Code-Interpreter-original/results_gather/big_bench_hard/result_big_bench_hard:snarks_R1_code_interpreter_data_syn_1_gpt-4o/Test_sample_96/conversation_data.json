    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"They're losing to a team with a terrible record. I for one am shocked.\"\n   - Here, the speaker is expressing \"shock\" that a team is losing to another team with a terrible record. The use of the word \"shocked\" in this context is likely sarcastic because it is generally expected that a team with a better record should win against a team with a terrible record. Therefore, the speaker is likely not genuinely shocked but is instead using sarcasm to highlight the unexpectedness or irony of the situation.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"They're losing to a team with a winning record. I for one am shocked.\"\n   - In this statement, the speaker is expressing \"shock\" that a team is losing to another team with a winning record. This situation is more expected, as a team with a winning record is likely to be stronger. Therefore, the expression of shock here is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns with the expected outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it expresses surprise at an outcome that is contrary to expectations, whereas statement (B) aligns with expectations and is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) They're losing to a team with a terrible record.
