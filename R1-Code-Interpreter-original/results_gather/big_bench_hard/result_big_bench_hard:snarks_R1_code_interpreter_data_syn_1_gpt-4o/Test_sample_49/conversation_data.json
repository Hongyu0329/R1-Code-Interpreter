    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually for humorous or emphatic effect.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"Just healthy meals wouldn't cut it for his active lifestyle.\"\n- This statement suggests that healthy meals alone are not sufficient for his active lifestyle. It implies that something more is needed, which is a straightforward statement without any apparent sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"Just healthy meals cut it for his active lifestyle.\"\n- This statement suggests that healthy meals alone are sufficient for his active lifestyle. However, if the speaker believes that healthy meals are not enough, this statement could be sarcastic, implying the opposite of what is said.\n\nGiven the typical use of sarcasm, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic if the speaker actually believes that healthy meals are not sufficient for an active lifestyle. The sarcasm would lie in the understatement or the contradiction between the statement and the speaker's true belief.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is likely to be option (B).\n\n<<<(B) Just healthy meals cut it for his active lifestyle>>>"
