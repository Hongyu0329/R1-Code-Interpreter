    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the content and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is meant, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"It's not our job to fund education! It should be the government paying the maintenance to keep schools open.\"\n- This statement suggests that the responsibility of funding education should fall on the government. This is a common and logical argument, as governments typically fund public education. There is no apparent irony or contradiction in this statement.\n\n(B) \"It's not our job to fund education! It should be the kids paying the maintenance to keep schools open.\"\n- This statement suggests that children should be responsible for paying to keep schools open. This is an absurd and unrealistic suggestion, as children typically do not have the means or responsibility to fund their own education. The irony and absurdity of this statement suggest sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is likely the sarcastic statement because it presents an unrealistic and ironic suggestion that contradicts common expectations.\n\n<<<(B) It's not our job to fund education! It should be the kids paying the maintenance to keep schools open>>>"
