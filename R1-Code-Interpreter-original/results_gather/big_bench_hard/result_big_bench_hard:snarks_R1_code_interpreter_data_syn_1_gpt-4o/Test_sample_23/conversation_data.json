    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the literal meaning of each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"You're right, it's the first week of winter! It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The statement suggests that since it's the first week of winter, it will get warmer in a couple of weeks.\n   - Contextual Analysis: Typically, winter is associated with colder weather, and it is unlikely to get warmer as winter progresses. Therefore, the expectation of warmer weather in the middle of winter is contrary to common experience, which suggests sarcasm.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"You're right, it's the last week of winter! It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: The statement suggests that since it's the last week of winter, it will get warmer in a couple of weeks.\n   - Contextual Analysis: As winter ends, it is common for temperatures to rise as spring approaches. Therefore, the expectation of warmer weather after the last week of winter aligns with common experience, which suggests sincerity rather than sarcasm.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it contradicts the typical expectation of winter weather patterns.\n\n<<<(A)>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) You're right, it's the first week of winter!
