    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical usage of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is true or expected, often in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. **SCIENCE CAUSES VACCINES!**\n   - This statement is factually correct. Science, through research and development, is indeed responsible for the creation of vaccines. There is no inherent sarcasm in stating a factual relationship.\n\n2. **EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!**\n   - This statement is less straightforward. Evolution is a biological process that explains the diversity of life and how species change over time. It is not directly responsible for the creation of vaccines. Saying that \"evolution causes vaccines\" could be seen as sarcastic because it attributes the creation of vaccines to a process that is not directly involved in their development. This could be interpreted as mocking or making an ironic statement about the misunderstanding of scientific concepts.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement \"EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!\" is more likely to be sarcastic because it misattributes the cause of vaccines to a process that is not directly related, potentially in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\n<<<(B) EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) SCIENCE CAUSES VACCINES!\n(B) EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
