    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the meaning and context of each option.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"You didn't realize that bikes are a stationary object?\"\n   - This statement implies that bikes are stationary, which is factually incorrect because bikes are meant for movement. The statement could be sarcastic because it suggests something that is obviously not true, implying that the listener should have known better.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"You didn't realize that bikes aren't a stationary object?\"\n   - This statement implies that bikes are not stationary, which is factually correct. The statement is straightforward and does not carry an obvious sarcastic tone because it aligns with the truth.\n\nGiven this analysis, Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an obviously false statement in a way that suggests the listener should have known the truth.\n\n<<<answer A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) You didn't realize that bikes are a stationary object?\n(B) You didn't realize that bikes aren't a stationary object?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
