    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the logical consistency and the typical use of sarcasm in language. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is meant, or it involves an incongruity between the statement and reality.\n\nLet's analyze both options:\n\n(A) \"He's over six feet, so he must be tall.\"\n- This statement is logically consistent. Being over six feet is generally considered tall, so there is no apparent sarcasm here.\n\n(B) \"He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful.\"\n- This statement introduces an incongruity. Being over six feet is a physical characteristic and does not inherently relate to someone's character or how \"wonderful\" they are. The use of \"wonderful\" in this context could be sarcastic, implying that height has no bearing on someone's wonderfulness.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses an incongruous relationship between height and being \"wonderful\" to possibly mock or highlight the absurdity of equating physical stature with personal qualities.\n\n<<<(B) He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful>>>"
