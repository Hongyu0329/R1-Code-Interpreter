    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical expectations in a basketball scenario. \n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - In basketball, when a player is at halfcourt and has a wide open pass, the expected and logical action is to pass the ball to a teammate who is in a better position to score. \n   - Shooting from halfcourt is generally not the expected or logical choice unless it's a last-second shot or a special situation.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Statements:**\n   - **Option (A):** \"When you're at halfcourt and have a wide open pass, the obvious choice is to pass.\"\n     - This statement aligns with the typical expectation in basketball. It is straightforward and not sarcastic.\n   - **Option (B):** \"When you're at halfcourt and have a wide open pass, the obvious choice is to shoot.\"\n     - This statement contradicts the typical expectation. Shooting from halfcourt when a pass is available is not the obvious choice, making this statement likely sarcastic.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sarcasm in Option (B) arises from the contradiction between the expected action (passing) and the stated action (shooting), which is presented as \"obvious\" when it is not.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is Option (B).\n\n<<<(B) When you're at halfcourt and have a wide open pass, the obvious choice is to shoot>>>"
