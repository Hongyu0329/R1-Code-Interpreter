    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a smart move!\"\n- This statement acknowledges the negative consequences of blocking the river (no water and no electricity) but then calls the action of blocking it a \"smart move.\" The use of \"smart move\" in this context is likely sarcastic because it contradicts the negative outcome described.\n\n(B) \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a terrible move!\"\n- This statement is straightforward and consistent. It describes the negative consequences and labels the action as a \"terrible move,\" which aligns with the negative outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is likely the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by calling a clearly negative action \"smart.\"\n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script that checks for sarcasm based on the presence of contradictory elements in the statements.\n\n```python\ndef is_sarcastic(statement):\n    negative_consequences = \"no water and no electricity\"\n    if negative_consequences in statement and \"smart move\" in statement:\n        return True\n    return False\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a smart move!\",\n    \"B\": \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a terrible move!\"\n}\n\nsarcastic_option = None\nfor option, statement in options.items():\n    if is_sarcastic(statement):\n        sarcastic_option = option\n        break\n\nprint(sarcastic_option)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will help confirm which statement is sarcastic.",
    "The code output indicates that option (A) is identified as the sarcastic statement. This aligns with our earlier reasoning that option (A) uses irony by calling a negative action \"smart,\" which is a common indicator of sarcasm.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Without the river there's no water and no electricity.
