    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"How could Government control of the internet be bad?\" - This statement could be sarcastic if the speaker believes that government control of the internet is indeed bad, and they are using this rhetorical question to mock the idea that it could be seen as harmless or beneficial.\n\n(B) \"How could Government control of the internet be beneficial?\" - This statement could be sarcastic if the speaker believes that government control of the internet is not beneficial, and they are using this rhetorical question to mock the idea that it could be seen as beneficial.\n\nTo determine which is more likely to be sarcastic, we need to consider common perceptions. Generally, there is a significant amount of skepticism and criticism regarding government control of the internet, with many people viewing it as a threat to freedom and privacy. Therefore, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it mocks the idea that government control could be harmless or beneficial, which aligns with the common critical view.\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<(A) How could Government control of the internet be bad?>>>"
