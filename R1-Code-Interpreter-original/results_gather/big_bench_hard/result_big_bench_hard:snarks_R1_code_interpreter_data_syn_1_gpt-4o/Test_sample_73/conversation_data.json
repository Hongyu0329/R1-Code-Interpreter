    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a humorous or mocking way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"College is happening: forgetting assignments, stressing over grades, worrying about finals, etc. It's been a stressful semester.\"\n- This statement describes a typical college experience with negative aspects such as forgetting assignments and stressing over grades. The conclusion, \"It's been a stressful semester,\" aligns with the negative experiences described. There is no contradiction or irony here, so this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"College is happening: forgetting assignments, stressing over grades, worrying about finals, etc. It's been a fun semester.\"\n- This statement also describes negative aspects of college life. However, it concludes with \"It's been a fun semester,\" which contradicts the negative experiences mentioned. This contradiction suggests sarcasm, as the speaker is likely implying that the semester was not fun at all.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by describing a stressful situation as \"fun.\"\n\n<<<B>>>"
