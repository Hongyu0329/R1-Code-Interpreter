    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what one actually means, often for humorous or emphatic effect.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) \"The two minute wait in line is too long for me, I think I'll just leave.\"\n- A two-minute wait is generally considered very short. Saying it's \"too long\" could be sarcastic because, in reality, most people would not consider two minutes to be a long wait.\n\n(B) \"The two hour wait in line is too long for me, I think I'll just leave.\"\n- A two-hour wait is indeed long, and saying it's \"too long\" is a straightforward statement of fact, not sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it exaggerates the inconvenience of a very short wait time, which is contrary to the typical perception.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
