    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"God, to think of how good it could have been having a person who prepared for things ahead of time in office.\"\n- This statement seems to express a genuine wish or regret that someone who prepares ahead of time was not in office. It doesn't appear to be sarcastic because it aligns with a logical and straightforward sentiment.\n\n(B) \"God, to think of how bad it could have been having a person who prepared for things ahead of time in office.\"\n- This statement, on the other hand, seems to imply the opposite of what is logically expected. Typically, having someone who prepares ahead of time is considered a positive trait. Therefore, saying it would have been \"bad\" is likely intended to be sarcastic, suggesting that the speaker actually believes it would have been good.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally stated.\n\n<<<(B) God, to think of how bad it could have been having a person who prepared for things ahead of time in office>>>"
