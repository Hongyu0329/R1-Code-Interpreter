    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that implies the opposite of what is being said, often with a mocking or ironic tone.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore\"\n- This statement suggests that simply being happy will prevent depression. The tone can be interpreted as dismissive of the complexity of depression, implying that it's easy to overcome by just deciding to be happy. This could be seen as sarcastic because it oversimplifies a serious issue.\n\n(B) \"Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\"\n- This statement suggests being happy about not being depressed anymore. It doesn't carry the same dismissive tone as option A. It seems more straightforward and less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it trivializes the issue of depression by suggesting a simplistic solution.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore\n(B) Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
