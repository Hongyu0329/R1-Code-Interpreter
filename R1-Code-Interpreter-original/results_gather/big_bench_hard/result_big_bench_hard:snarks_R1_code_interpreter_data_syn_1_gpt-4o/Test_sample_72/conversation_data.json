    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical expectations associated with the statements.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"Armed revolutionaries have not been making a lot of change for middle class Americans lately.\"\n   - This statement suggests that armed revolutionaries are not impacting middle-class Americans. Given the current socio-political climate, it is generally expected that armed revolutionaries are not actively making changes for middle-class Americans. Therefore, this statement aligns with the expected reality and is likely not sarcastic.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"Armed revolutionaries have been making a lot of change for middle class Americans lately.\"\n   - This statement suggests that armed revolutionaries are actively making changes for middle-class Americans. This is contrary to the typical expectation, as armed revolutionaries are not commonly seen as agents of change for the middle class in recent times. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic, as it implies an unexpected or exaggerated scenario.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an unlikely scenario in a manner that suggests irony or exaggeration.\n\n<<<(B) Armed revolutionaries have been making a lot of change for middle class Americans lately>>>"
