    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical connotations of the words used in each option.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"One of my least-favorite things to do working was taking out and smelling the trash.\"\n   - This statement is straightforward and likely genuine. It expresses a dislike for taking out and smelling the trash, which is a common sentiment as trash is generally unpleasant.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"One of my favorite things to do working was taking out and smelling the trash.\"\n   - This statement is likely sarcastic. It claims that taking out and smelling the trash is a favorite activity, which is contrary to the usual perception of trash being unpleasant. The juxtaposition of \"favorite\" with an activity that is typically disliked suggests sarcasm.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (B) is the statement that is sarcastic because it uses positive language to describe an activity that is generally considered negative, indicating a sarcastic tone.\n\n<<<(B) One of my favorite things to do working was taking out and smelling the trash>>>"
