    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in both options. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Isn't it just the best? This has been me for the past several days as well. It's been less than enough sleep for the past week.\"\n- The phrase \"Isn't it just the best?\" is often used sarcastically when the speaker actually means the opposite. In this context, the speaker is talking about having \"less than enough sleep,\" which is generally not considered a good thing. Therefore, the use of \"Isn't it just the best?\" is likely sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"Isn't it just the best? This has been me for the past several days as well. It's been more than enough sleep for the past week.\"\n- Here, the phrase \"Isn't it just the best?\" could be interpreted as genuine because having \"more than enough sleep\" is typically seen as positive. However, if the speaker is using it sarcastically, they might be implying that having too much sleep is not actually desirable.\n\nGiven these analyses, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because the statement about having \"less than enough sleep\" contrasts with the positive connotation of \"Isn't it just the best?\" This contrast is a common feature of sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(A) Isn't it just the best? This has been me for the past several days as well. It's been less than enough sleep for the past week>>>"
