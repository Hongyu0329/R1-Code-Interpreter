    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a $50,000 scholarship\"\n   - Here, the phrase \"only got a $50,000 scholarship\" is likely sarcastic because $50,000 is a significant amount of money for a scholarship. The use of \"only\" implies that the speaker is downplaying the value of the scholarship, which is a common form of sarcasm.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a $50 scholarship\"\n   - In this case, the statement seems more literal. A $50 scholarship is indeed a small amount, especially considering \"years of work.\" There is no apparent exaggeration or contradiction in the statement that would suggest sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement A is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses exaggeration to imply the opposite of what is literally being said.\n\n<<<A>>>"
