    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical expectations associated with takeout meals.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"Wow that's crazy, I've never had a takeout meal that used hardwood containers before!\"\n   - Hardwood containers are not commonly used for takeout meals. They are typically more expensive and not practical for single-use purposes. Therefore, expressing surprise about this could be genuine if someone actually encountered such a situation, but it could also be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that it's an absurd or unlikely scenario.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"Wow that's crazy, I've never had a takeout meal that used plastic containers before!\"\n   - Plastic containers are very common for takeout meals. Expressing surprise about this is likely sarcastic because it contradicts the common experience of most people who have had takeout meals.\n\nGiven the typical context of takeout meals, statement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it feigns surprise about a very common occurrence, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(B) Wow thats crazy, I've never had a takeout meal that used plastic containers before!>>>"
