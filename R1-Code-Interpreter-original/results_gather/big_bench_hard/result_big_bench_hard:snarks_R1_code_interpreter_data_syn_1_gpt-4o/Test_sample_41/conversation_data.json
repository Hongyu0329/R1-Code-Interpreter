    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the meaning and context of each option.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"I personally don't believe the 7 time felon that just got done murdering a random woman wouldn't lie.\"\n   - This statement implies that the speaker does not believe the felon would tell the truth. The use of \"wouldn't lie\" suggests that the speaker is expressing disbelief in the felon's honesty, which aligns with the expectation that a felon might lie. Therefore, this statement is straightforward and not sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"I personally don't believe the 7 time felon that just got done murdering a random woman would lie.\"\n   - This statement implies that the speaker does not believe the felon would lie, which is contrary to the expectation that a felon, especially one who has committed murder, might lie. The statement is likely sarcastic because it suggests disbelief in the felon's dishonesty, which is unexpected and ironic given the context.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to express disbelief in the felon's potential dishonesty, which is contrary to the expected behavior of a felon.\n\n<<<(B) I personally don't believe the 7 time felon that just got done murdering a random woman would lie>>>"
