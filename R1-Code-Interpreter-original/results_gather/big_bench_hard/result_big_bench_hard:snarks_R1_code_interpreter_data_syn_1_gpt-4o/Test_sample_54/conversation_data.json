    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to understand the context and typical societal beliefs about diamonds. Generally, diamonds are considered valuable due to their rarity, beauty, and the marketing efforts of the diamond industry. Therefore, the statement \"We all know diamonds are valuable\" aligns with the common belief and is likely not sarcastic.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"We all know diamonds are worthless\" contradicts the common belief and is likely intended to be sarcastic. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected to convey a point humorously or critically.\n\nThus, the sarcastic statement is the one that contradicts the widely accepted view of diamonds being valuable.\n\n<<<(A) We all know diamonds are worthless>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) We all know diamonds are worthless\n(B) We all know diamonds are valuable\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
