    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical expectations associated with the subjects mentioned in the statements.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"Yeah, let's crucify this nonprofit for making money, they shouldn't be doing that\"\n   - Nonprofits are generally expected to focus on their mission rather than making a profit. However, they do need to generate revenue to sustain their operations. The statement suggests that it is wrong for a nonprofit to make money, which is an exaggerated criticism, as making money is necessary for their survival. This exaggeration indicates sarcasm.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"Yeah, let's crucify this company for making money, they shouldn't be doing that\"\n   - Companies are expected to make money as their primary goal is profit. Criticizing a company for making money is illogical because it is their main purpose. However, the statement does not carry the same level of exaggeration or contradiction as statement (A) because companies are inherently profit-driven.\n\nGiven this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it criticizes a nonprofit for making money, which is a necessary part of their operation, albeit not their primary goal. The sarcasm lies in the exaggeration of the criticism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
