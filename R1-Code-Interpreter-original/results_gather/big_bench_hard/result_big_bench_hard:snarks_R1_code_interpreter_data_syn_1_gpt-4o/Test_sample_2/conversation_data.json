    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it okay\"\n- This statement suggests that making jokes or memes about racism somehow makes it acceptable. The use of \"that's what keeps it okay\" could be interpreted as sarcastic because making light of racism is generally not considered acceptable. The statement could be mocking the idea that joking about serious issues makes them less serious.\n\n(B) \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic\"\n- This statement suggests that making jokes or memes about racism contributes to a toxic environment. The use of \"that's what keeps it toxic\" is a straightforward assertion that aligns with the general understanding that making light of serious issues can perpetuate negativity.\n\nGiven this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an ironic statement that contradicts the general consensus on the seriousness of racism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
