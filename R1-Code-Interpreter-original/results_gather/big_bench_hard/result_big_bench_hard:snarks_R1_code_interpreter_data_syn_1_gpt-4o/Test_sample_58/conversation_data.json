    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"You mean you're only into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\"\n- This statement suggests that the person being addressed is exclusively interested in people with negative traits. The use of \"only\" implies exclusivity, which can be sarcastic if the speaker is mocking the idea that someone would genuinely prefer such negative traits.\n\n(B) \"You mean you're not into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\"\n- This statement suggests that the person being addressed is not interested in people with negative traits. The use of \"not\" implies a denial, which is less likely to be sarcastic unless the context strongly suggests otherwise.\n\nIn general, sarcasm often involves exaggeration or an unexpected twist. Option (A) exaggerates by suggesting exclusivity in a negative trait, which is more likely to be sarcastic. Option (B) is more straightforward and less likely to be sarcastic without additional context.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is likely to be option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) You mean you're only into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\n(B) You mean you're not into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
