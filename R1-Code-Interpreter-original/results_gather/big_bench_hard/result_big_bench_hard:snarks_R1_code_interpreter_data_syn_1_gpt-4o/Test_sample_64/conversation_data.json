    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Of course there's no security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!\"\n- This statement implies that the game designers claim the game is realistic, yet the absence of security cameras in the White House contradicts this claim. In real life, the White House is heavily secured with cameras, so the statement is likely sarcastic because it highlights the absurdity of the claim.\n\n(B) \"Of course there's several security cameras in the White House in the game, they said it's just like real life!\"\n- This statement aligns with reality, as the White House is expected to have security cameras. There is no contradiction or irony here, so it is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it points out the unrealistic nature of the game by contrasting it with the claim of realism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
