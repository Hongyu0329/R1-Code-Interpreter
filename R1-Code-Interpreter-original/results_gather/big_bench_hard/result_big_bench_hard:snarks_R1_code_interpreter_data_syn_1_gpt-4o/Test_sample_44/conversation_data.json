    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the literal meaning of each statement and compare it to common knowledge or expectations.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"People never foment wars to relinquish territory.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: This statement suggests that people do not start wars with the intention of giving up territory.\n   - Common Knowledge: Historically, wars are often fought to gain or defend territory, not to give it up. Therefore, the literal meaning of this statement contradicts common expectations, which could imply sarcasm.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"People never foment wars to conquer territory.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: This statement suggests that people do not start wars with the intention of conquering territory.\n   - Common Knowledge: This is contrary to historical evidence, as wars are frequently fought to conquer territory. The literal meaning of this statement also contradicts common expectations, which could imply sarcasm.\n\nBoth statements could be interpreted as sarcastic because they both contradict common knowledge about the reasons for starting wars. However, the statement that is more likely to be sarcastic is the one that most directly contradicts the primary and well-known motivation for war, which is conquest.\n\nLet's evaluate this further by considering which statement is more likely to be taken as a sarcastic remark based on the context of historical motivations for war.\n\n- Historically, the primary motivation for war has been to conquer territory rather than to relinquish it. Therefore, the statement that most directly contradicts this primary motivation is likely to be more sarcastic.\n\nThus, the statement \"People never foment wars to conquer territory\" (Option B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it directly contradicts the well-known and primary motivation for war.\n\n<<<(B) People never foment wars to conquer territory>>>"
