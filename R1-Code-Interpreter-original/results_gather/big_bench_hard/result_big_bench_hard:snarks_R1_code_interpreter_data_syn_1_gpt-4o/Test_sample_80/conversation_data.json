    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way. \n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"I'm sure you wouldn't have remained completely calm if a teacher attacked you\" - This statement seems straightforward and literal. It suggests that the speaker genuinely believes the person would not remain calm in such a situation.\n\n(B) \"I'm sure you would have remained completely calm if a teacher attacked you\" - This statement is likely sarcastic. It implies disbelief that someone could remain calm in such a stressful and unexpected situation. The speaker is likely mocking the idea that anyone could stay calm if attacked by a teacher.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally stated.\n\n<<<(B) I'm sure you would have remained completely calm if a teacher attacked you>>>"
