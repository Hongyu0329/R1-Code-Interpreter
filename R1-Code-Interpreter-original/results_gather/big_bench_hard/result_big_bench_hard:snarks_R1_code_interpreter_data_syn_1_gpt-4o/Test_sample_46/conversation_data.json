    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Every package I get from Amazon is 2 to 3 days late, busted up, doesn't work right, and sometimes not even what I ordered. So disappointed I pay for free shipping with Prime.\"\n\n- The speaker expresses dissatisfaction with the service and follows it with a statement of disappointment. This aligns with the negative experience described, so it is likely sincere rather than sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"Every package I get from Amazon is 2 to 3 days late, busted up, doesn't work right, and sometimes not even what I ordered. So happy I pay for free shipping with Prime.\"\n\n- The speaker describes a negative experience but follows it with a statement of happiness. This is contradictory and suggests sarcasm, as the positive emotion does not match the negative experience.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by expressing happiness in a situation that is clearly negative.\n\n<<<(B) Every package I get from Amazon is 2 to 3 days late, busted up, doesn't work right, and sometimes not even what I ordered. So happy I pay for free shipping with Prime>>>"
