    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Ah yes, late night vote on a bill written behind closed doors by one party. How undemocratic\"\n- This statement seems to be straightforward and literal. It criticizes the process as being undemocratic, which aligns with the negative connotation of a bill being written behind closed doors by one party.\n\n(B) \"Ah yes, late night vote on a bill written behind closed doors by one party. How democratic\"\n- This statement appears to be sarcastic. It uses the word \"democratic\" in a context that is typically considered undemocratic (a bill written behind closed doors by one party), suggesting the opposite of what is stated.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is likely the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to highlight the undemocratic nature of the situation by calling it \"democratic.\"\n\n<<<(B) Ah yes, late night vote on a bill written behind closed doors by one party. How democratic>>>"
