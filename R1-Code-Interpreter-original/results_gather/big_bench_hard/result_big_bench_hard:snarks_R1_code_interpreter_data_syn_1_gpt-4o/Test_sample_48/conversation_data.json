    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"No, you misunderstand. Those who make more money are inherently better.\"\n- This statement could be sarcastic if the speaker actually believes that making more money does not make someone inherently better. The use of \"inherently better\" suggests a strong, possibly exaggerated claim, which can be a sign of sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"No, you misunderstand. Those who make more money aren't inherently better.\"\n- This statement seems straightforward and aligns with a common belief that wealth does not equate to personal value or superiority. It lacks the exaggeration or irony typically found in sarcasm.\n\nGiven this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it makes an exaggerated claim that could be intended to mock the idea that wealth equates to personal superiority.\n\n<<<answer A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) No, you misunderstand.
