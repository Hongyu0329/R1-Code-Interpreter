    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"He's just kindhearted. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!\"\n- This statement seems to imply that being kindhearted is a positive trait for someone running a country. The phrase \"nothing wrong with him running the country in that case\" aligns with the positive connotation of being kindhearted. Therefore, this statement does not appear to be sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"He's just demented. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!\"\n- This statement uses the word \"demented,\" which has a negative connotation, suggesting that the person is not mentally fit. The follow-up phrase \"nothing wrong with him running the country in that case\" contradicts the negative implication of \"demented,\" suggesting irony or sarcasm. It implies that there is indeed something wrong with a demented person running the country.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally stated.\n\n<<<(B) He's just demented. Okay, well nothing wrong with him running the country in that case!>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) He's just kindhearted.
