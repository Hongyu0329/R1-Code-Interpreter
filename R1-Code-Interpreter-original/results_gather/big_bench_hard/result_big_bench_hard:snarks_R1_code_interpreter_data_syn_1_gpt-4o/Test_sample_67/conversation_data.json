    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a great way to start the year.\"\n- This statement suggests that hypothermia and drownings, which are negative events, are a \"great\" way to start the year. The use of the word \"great\" in this context is likely ironic, as these events are typically undesirable. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a terrible way to start the year.\"\n- This statement directly acknowledges that hypothermia and drownings are negative events by calling them \"terrible.\" There is no irony or contradiction in this statement, so it is not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the sarcastic statement.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a great way to start the year\n(B) A wave of hypothermia and drownings will be a terrible way to start the year\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
