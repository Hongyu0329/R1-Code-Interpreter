    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the language used in both options.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a server threatening issue.\"\n   - This statement uses hyperbole to describe the accumulation of emails as a \"server threatening issue.\" The exaggeration here is that an individual's email count could threaten a server, which is unlikely and thus could be seen as sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a life threatening issue.\"\n   - This statement also uses hyperbole, but it takes it further by suggesting that an email count could become a \"life threatening issue.\" This is even more exaggerated and absurd, as emails cannot directly threaten one's life.\n\nSarcasm often involves saying something that is obviously not true or is an exaggeration to make a point. In this case, both statements are exaggerated, but Option (B) is more absurd because it suggests a direct threat to life from emails, which is clearly not possible. This makes Option (B) more likely to be sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is sarcastic is Option (B).\n\n<<<(B) I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a life threatening issue>>>"
