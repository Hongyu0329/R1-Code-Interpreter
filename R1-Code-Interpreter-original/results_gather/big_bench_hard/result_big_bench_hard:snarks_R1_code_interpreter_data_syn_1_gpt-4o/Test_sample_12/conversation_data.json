    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical understanding of the terms used in the statements.\n\n1. **Understanding Anarchism and Democracy:**\n   - **Anarchism** is a political philosophy that advocates for self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. It is often characterized by the absence of a state or hierarchical authority. Anarchism is not typically taught as a mainstream or prime example of a governing system in most educational contexts.\n   - **Democracy** is a system of government where the citizens exercise power by voting. It is widely recognized and taught as a prime example of a governing system in many educational contexts.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Statements:**\n   - Statement (A): \"Yeah, anarchism is taught as a prime example of a governing system.\"\n     - This statement is likely sarcastic because anarchism is not commonly taught as a prime example of a governing system. The use of \"Yeah\" at the beginning can imply a sarcastic tone, suggesting that the speaker does not genuinely believe anarchism is taught as a prime example.\n   - Statement (B): \"Yeah, democracy is taught as a prime example of a governing system.\"\n     - This statement is likely not sarcastic because democracy is indeed commonly taught as a prime example of a governing system. The statement aligns with the general understanding and educational practices.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it contradicts the typical educational narrative regarding governing systems.\n\n<<<A>>>"
