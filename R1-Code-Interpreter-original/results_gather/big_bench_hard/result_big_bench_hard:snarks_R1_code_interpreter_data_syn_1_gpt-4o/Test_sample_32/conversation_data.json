    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) \"Only rich people can afford healthy food\" - This statement could be interpreted as a straightforward assertion that only wealthy individuals have the means to purchase healthy food. However, if said in a sarcastic tone, it could imply that the speaker actually believes that healthy food should be accessible to everyone, not just the rich.\n\n(B) \"Not only rich people can afford healthy food\" - This statement suggests that people from various economic backgrounds can afford healthy food. It seems to be a more inclusive and straightforward statement without an apparent sarcastic tone.\n\nGiven these analyses, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it can be interpreted as an ironic comment on the socioeconomic barriers to accessing healthy food, especially if the speaker's tone suggests disbelief or criticism of the idea that only the rich can afford it.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(A) Only rich people can afford healthy food>>>"
