    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the logical consistency of each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"I earn money for winning? Sign me up!\"\n   - This statement is logically consistent and positive. Earning money for winning is a desirable outcome, and the phrase \"Sign me up!\" indicates enthusiasm and agreement. There is no contradiction or irony here, so it is unlikely to be sarcastic.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"I lose money for winning? Sign me up!\"\n   - This statement contains a contradiction. Losing money for winning is an undesirable and illogical outcome. The phrase \"Sign me up!\" is typically used to express eagerness or agreement, but in this context, it creates irony because no one would genuinely want to lose money for winning. This contradiction suggests sarcasm.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement (B) is the one that is sarcastic because it uses irony to express the opposite of what is literally stated.\n\n<<<answer B) I lose money for winning? Sign me up!>>>"
