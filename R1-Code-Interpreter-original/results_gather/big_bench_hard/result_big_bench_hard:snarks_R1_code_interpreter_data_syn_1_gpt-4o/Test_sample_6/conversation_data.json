    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier.\"\n   - This statement implies that being poor is a choice and that simply deciding not to be poor would make life easier. This is a common sarcastic remark because it oversimplifies the complex socio-economic factors that contribute to poverty. The sarcasm lies in the absurdity of suggesting that poverty is a simple choice.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier.\"\n   - This statement suggests that being polite is a simple choice and implies that the person being addressed is choosing to be rude. While it could be seen as a straightforward suggestion, it lacks the same level of absurdity and oversimplification present in Option (A). It is more of a direct suggestion rather than a sarcastic remark.\n\nGiven this analysis, Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to its oversimplification of a complex issue and the implied absurdity of the suggestion.\n\n<<<(A) Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier>>>"
