    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in both options.\n\n1. **Option A**: \"You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the elephants, that woefully endangered species.\"\n   - Elephants are indeed an endangered species, and the statement seems to express genuine concern or care for them. There is no apparent contradiction or irony in this statement, so it does not seem sarcastic.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species.\"\n   - Trolls, in the context of internet culture, are not an endangered species. In fact, they are often seen as a nuisance or a negative presence. The statement implies that trolls are endangered, which is an ironic and contradictory statement. This use of irony suggests sarcasm.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option B is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by referring to trolls as an \"endangered species,\" which is contrary to the common perception of trolls.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) You're welcome my dear friend.
