    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the tone of each option.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Never had as much fun in my life as when the cops found my backpack of weed in my car trunk.\"\n   - This statement suggests that the speaker is claiming to have had fun when the police found illegal substances in their car. Given the serious nature of the situation, it is unlikely that someone would genuinely find this fun. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic, as it implies the opposite of what is being said.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Never had as much anxiety in my life when the cops found my backpack of weed in my car trunk.\"\n   - This statement expresses anxiety, which is a reasonable and expected reaction to the situation described. There is no indication of sarcasm here, as the statement aligns with the expected emotional response.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option (A) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony to convey the opposite of what is literally being said.\n\n<<<A>>>"
