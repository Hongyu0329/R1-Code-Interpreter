    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying something in a way that is opposite to what is meant, often to mock or convey contempt.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) \"don't forget there are people in Antarctica\" - This statement could be taken literally, as there are indeed people in Antarctica, such as researchers and scientists. However, it could also be sarcastic if used in a context where someone is exaggerating the importance of remembering something trivial.\n\n(B) \"don't forget there are people in suffering\" - This statement is more likely to be taken seriously, as it highlights a genuine issue of people suffering, which is a serious and empathetic concern. Using sarcasm in this context would be inappropriate and insensitive.\n\nGiven these analyses, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic, especially if used in a context where the speaker is downplaying the importance of remembering something by comparing it to remembering people in a remote and less populated area like Antarctica.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(A) don't forget there are people in Antarctica>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) don't forget there are people in Antarctica\n(B) don't forget there are people in suffering\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
