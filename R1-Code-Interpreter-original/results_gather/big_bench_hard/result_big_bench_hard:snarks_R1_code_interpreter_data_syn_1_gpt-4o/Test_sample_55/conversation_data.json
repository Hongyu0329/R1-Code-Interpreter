    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Because women are totally incapable of doing everyday tasks like pumping gas without a partner taking over and doing it for her.\"\n- This statement suggests that women cannot perform simple tasks without help, which is a stereotype and likely not the speaker's true belief. The use of \"totally incapable\" in this context could be sarcastic, as it exaggerates the stereotype to an absurd level.\n\n(B) \"Because women are totally capable of doing everyday tasks like pumping gas without a partner taking over and doing it for her.\"\n- This statement asserts that women can perform everyday tasks independently, which is a straightforward and likely true statement. There is no apparent irony or exaggeration here.\n\nGiven this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses exaggeration and irony to mock the stereotype that women cannot perform simple tasks without assistance.\n\n<<<A>>>"
