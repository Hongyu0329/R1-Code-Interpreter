    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"This website is well known to post falsehoods and spread false rumors. Rock-solid source if you ask me.\"\n- The first sentence states that the website is known for falsehoods and rumors, which is negative.\n- The second sentence, \"Rock-solid source if you ask me,\" is positive and contradicts the first sentence. This contradiction suggests sarcasm because calling a source \"rock-solid\" when it is known for falsehoods is ironic.\n\n(B) \"This website is well known to post falsehoods and spread false rumors. Suspicious source if you ask me.\"\n- The first sentence is the same as in option A, indicating a negative reputation.\n- The second sentence, \"Suspicious source if you ask me,\" aligns with the first sentence's negative tone. There is no contradiction or irony here, so it is not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by calling a known unreliable source \"rock-solid.\"\n\n<<<(A) This website is well known to post falsehoods and spread false rumors. Rock-solid source if you ask me>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) This website is well known to post falsehoods and spread false rumors.
