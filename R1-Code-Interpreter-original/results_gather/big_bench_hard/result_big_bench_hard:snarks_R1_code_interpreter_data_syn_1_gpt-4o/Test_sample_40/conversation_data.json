    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is meant, usually in a humorous or mocking way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Protein supplements are way more expensive than $1 breakfast gruel\"\n- \"Gruel\" is typically a cheap, bland, and unappealing food. By comparing protein supplements to something as inexpensive and undesirable as gruel, the statement could be implying that protein supplements are overpriced or not worth the cost, which could be sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"Protein supplements are way more expensive than $1 breakfast burritos\"\n- Burritos, even inexpensive ones, are generally considered more substantial and appealing than gruel. This statement seems more straightforward and factual, as it compares the cost of protein supplements to a more reasonable and common food item.\n\nGiven these analyses, option (A) seems more likely to be sarcastic because it uses an exaggerated comparison to something notably cheap and undesirable (gruel), which could imply a mocking tone about the cost of protein supplements.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is likely option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
