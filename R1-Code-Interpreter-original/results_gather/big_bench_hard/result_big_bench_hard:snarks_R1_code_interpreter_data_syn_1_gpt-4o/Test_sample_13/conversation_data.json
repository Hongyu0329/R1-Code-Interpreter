    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical associations with the items mentioned in the statements.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"Everyone knows salt is the highlight of gourmet sophistication.\"\n   - Salt is a common seasoning used in everyday cooking. It is not typically associated with gourmet sophistication. Therefore, saying that salt is the highlight of gourmet sophistication could be seen as sarcastic because it contrasts with the common perception of salt as a basic ingredient.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"Everyone knows caviar is the highlight of gourmet sophistication.\"\n   - Caviar is a luxury food item often associated with gourmet dining and sophistication. This statement aligns with the common perception of caviar, making it less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses exaggeration and contrasts with the common understanding of what is considered sophisticated in gourmet cuisine.\n\n<<<(A) Everyone knows salt is the highlight of gourmet sophistication>>>"
