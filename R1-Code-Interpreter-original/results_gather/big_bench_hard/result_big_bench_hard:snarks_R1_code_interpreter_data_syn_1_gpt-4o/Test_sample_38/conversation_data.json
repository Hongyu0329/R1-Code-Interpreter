    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in both options. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"Yeah, he's clearly apathetic to earning minutes based on his lackluster play and the fact that he's grabbing hot dogs at half time.\"\n- This statement suggests that the person is not interested in earning more playing time, which aligns with the description of \"lackluster play\" and \"grabbing hot dogs at half time.\" There is no contradiction or irony here, so it is likely not sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"Yeah, he's clearly dedicated to earning minutes based on his lackluster play and the fact that he's grabbing hot dogs at half time.\"\n- This statement suggests that the person is dedicated to earning more playing time, but it is followed by evidence of \"lackluster play\" and \"grabbing hot dogs at half time,\" which contradicts the idea of dedication. This contradiction creates irony, making the statement sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by stating the opposite of what the evidence suggests.\n\n<<<(B) Yeah, he's clearly dedicated to earning minutes based on his lackluster play and the fact that he's grabbing hot dogs at half time..>>>"
