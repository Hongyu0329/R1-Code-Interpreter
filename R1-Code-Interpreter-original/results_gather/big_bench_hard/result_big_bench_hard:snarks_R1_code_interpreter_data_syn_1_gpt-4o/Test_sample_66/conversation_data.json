    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic manner.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ??? Have my up vote for being rational\"\n- The phrase \"ARE U INSANE\" suggests disbelief or disagreement with the idea of liking the system.\n- The phrase \"Have my up vote for being rational\" seems to contradict the disbelief, as an upvote is typically a positive response, suggesting agreement or approval.\n- The contradiction between expressing disbelief and giving an upvote suggests sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ??? Have my down vote for being rational\"\n- Similar to option (A), the phrase \"ARE U INSANE\" suggests disbelief or disagreement.\n- The phrase \"Have my down vote for being rational\" aligns with the disbelief, as a downvote is a negative response, suggesting disapproval.\n- There is no contradiction here, so this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the sarcastic statement because it contains a contradiction between the expressed disbelief and the positive action of giving an upvote.\n\n<<<(A)>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) ARE U INSANE SAYIN U LIKE THIS SYSTEM HERE ???
