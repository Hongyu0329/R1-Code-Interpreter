    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is obviously false or exaggerated to make a point or to mock.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n(A) \"Impossible, as there's no one on the internet\" - This statement is likely sarcastic because it is common knowledge that the internet is widely used and populated by millions of users. Saying there's \"no one on the internet\" is an exaggeration and is contrary to the truth, which is a hallmark of sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"Impossible, as there's no one on the Moon\" - This statement is factual. As of now, there are no permanent human inhabitants on the Moon. Therefore, this statement is not sarcastic; it is simply stating a fact.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the sarcastic statement because it contradicts the well-known fact that the internet is heavily populated.\n\n<<<(A) Impossible, as there's no one on the internet>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Impossible, as there's no one on the internet\n(B) Impossible, as there's no one on the Moon\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
