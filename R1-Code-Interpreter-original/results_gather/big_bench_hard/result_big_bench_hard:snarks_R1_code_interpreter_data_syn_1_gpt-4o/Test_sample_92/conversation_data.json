    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"Bought the stock at $10.50 and sold at $100. Such profits being made\"\n   - In this statement, the person bought the stock at a low price ($10.50) and sold it at a much higher price ($100). This results in a significant profit. The phrase \"Such profits being made\" aligns with the actual outcome, which is indeed profitable. Therefore, this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"Bought the stock at $1050 and sold at $100. Such profits being made\"\n   - Here, the person bought the stock at a high price ($1050) and sold it at a much lower price ($100). This results in a substantial loss. The phrase \"Such profits being made\" contradicts the actual outcome, which is a loss. This contradiction suggests sarcasm, as the statement implies the opposite of the reality.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement (B) is sarcastic because it uses irony to highlight the loss by stating \"Such profits being made\" when, in fact, there is a loss.\n\n<<<(B) Bought the stock at $1050 and sold at $100. Such profits being made>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Bought the stock at $10.50 and sold at $100.
