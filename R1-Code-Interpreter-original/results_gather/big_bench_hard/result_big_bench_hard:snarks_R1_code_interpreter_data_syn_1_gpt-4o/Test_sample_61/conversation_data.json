    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"I mean their graphics guy did spend 15 minutes max on doing the day's work and the rest messing around. Their employees are always the laziest!\"\n- This statement seems to be straightforward. It criticizes the employees for being lazy, which aligns with the description of the graphics guy spending minimal time on work and the rest of the time messing around. There is no apparent contradiction or irony here.\n\n(B) \"I mean their graphics guy did spend 15 minutes max on doing the day's work and the rest messing around. Their employees are always the best!\"\n- This statement contains a contradiction. It describes the graphics guy as spending minimal time on work and the rest of the time messing around, which is generally not a trait of the \"best\" employees. The phrase \"Their employees are always the best!\" is likely intended to be sarcastic, as it contradicts the negative description provided.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses irony by praising the employees as \"the best\" despite describing behavior that is typically not praiseworthy.\n\n<<<(B) I mean their graphics guy did spend 15 minutes max on doing the day's work and the rest messing around. Their employees are always the best!>>>"
