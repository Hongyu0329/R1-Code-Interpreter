    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the use of language in both options. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"Wow. You're right. All those memes in the bitcoin sub and people posting about making money and what they're going to buy with it sure turned on people investing from in it.\"\n\n- This statement suggests that the memes and posts about making money encouraged people to invest in Bitcoin. The phrase \"turned on\" implies a positive reaction or encouragement.\n\n(B) \"Wow. You're right. All those memes in the bitcoin sub and people posting about making money and what they're going to buy with it sure turned off people investing from in it.\"\n\n- This statement suggests that the memes and posts about making money discouraged people from investing in Bitcoin. The phrase \"turned off\" implies a negative reaction or discouragement.\n\nIn the context of sarcasm, the speaker might be using a positive phrase to imply a negative outcome or vice versa. \n\n- In option (A), the statement seems straightforward and aligns with the expected outcome that positive posts would encourage investment.\n- In option (B), the statement uses \"turned off\" in a context where one might expect \"turned on,\" suggesting that the speaker is being sarcastic by implying that the positive posts actually discouraged investment.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses language that contradicts the expected outcome in a way that could be interpreted as mocking or ironic.\n\n<<<(B) Wow. You're right. All those memes in the bitcoin sub and people posting about making money and what they're going to buy with it sure turned off people investing from in it>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Wow.
