    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement.\n\n1. **Statement (A):** \"Working at a restaurant has made me an amazing chef.\"\n   - This statement could be interpreted as sincere or sarcastic, depending on the context. If the person worked at a high-end restaurant with skilled chefs, it might be sincere. However, if the restaurant is not known for high culinary standards, it could be sarcastic.\n\n2. **Statement (B):** \"Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef.\"\n   - This statement is more likely to be sarcastic. McDonald's is a fast-food chain known for standardized food preparation rather than gourmet cooking. Therefore, claiming to become an \"amazing chef\" from working there is likely intended to be humorous or ironic.\n\nGiven the general perception of McDonald's as a fast-food chain, statement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it contrasts the idea of being an \"amazing chef\" with the typical work environment and skills required at McDonald's.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(B) Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef>>>"
