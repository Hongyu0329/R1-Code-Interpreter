    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is true or expected, usually to mock or convey contempt.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago.\"\n- This statement implies that prices have not increased over a long period (eight years), which is unlikely given inflation and economic trends. Therefore, this statement is likely sarcastic because it suggests the opposite of what is typically true.\n\n(B) \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago.\"\n- This statement implies that prices have not increased over a very short period (eight days), which is more plausible. Prices generally do not change significantly over such a short time frame, so this statement is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it contradicts the common expectation that prices increase over a long period.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago\n(B) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
