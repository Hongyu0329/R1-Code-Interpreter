    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually to mock or convey contempt.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"Since corporate restriction equals free speech this is actually a big win for democracy\"\n- This statement suggests that restricting corporations is equivalent to free speech, which is a contradiction. Typically, free speech is about allowing more expression, not restricting it. The phrase \"big win for democracy\" is likely used sarcastically because restricting speech is generally not seen as a win for democracy.\n\n(B) \"Since corporate money equals free speech this is actually a big win for democracy\"\n- This statement refers to the idea that corporate money is considered a form of free speech, a concept that has been debated in the context of campaign finance laws. The phrase \"big win for democracy\" could be sarcastic if the speaker believes that equating money with speech undermines democratic principles.\n\nBoth statements could be interpreted as sarcastic, but the key is to identify which one is more likely to be sarcastic based on common discourse.\n\n- Statement (A) is less commonly discussed in public discourse, as it suggests a direct contradiction between restriction and free speech.\n- Statement (B) is a well-known issue, especially in the context of political campaign financing, where the idea that \"money equals speech\" is often criticized as undermining democracy.\n\nGiven the context and common usage, statement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it addresses a well-known controversial issue where the phrase \"big win for democracy\" is likely used to mock the idea that corporate money should be equated with free speech.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(B) Since corporate money equals free speech this is actually a big win for democracy>>>"
