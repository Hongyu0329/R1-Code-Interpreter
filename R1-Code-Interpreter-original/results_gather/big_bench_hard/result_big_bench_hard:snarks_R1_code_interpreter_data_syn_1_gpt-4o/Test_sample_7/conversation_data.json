    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each option.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead.\"\n   - This statement suggests replacing modern trams with an older mode of transportation, carriages. The suggestion is regressive and impractical, which implies sarcasm. The speaker likely does not genuinely believe that carriages are a better alternative to trams.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead.\"\n   - This statement suggests replacing trams with another modern form of transportation, lightrail. This is a plausible and reasonable suggestion, as lightrail systems are often seen as an upgrade or a more efficient alternative to trams. There is no clear indication of sarcasm here.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it suggests an impractical and regressive solution, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Yeah.
