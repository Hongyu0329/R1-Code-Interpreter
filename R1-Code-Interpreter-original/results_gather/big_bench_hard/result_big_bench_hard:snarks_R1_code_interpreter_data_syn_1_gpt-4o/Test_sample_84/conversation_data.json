    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the implied meaning behind each statement. Sarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is true or expected, often in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"People these days are so rich. Back in my day we didn't have luxuries.\"\n- This statement could be interpreted as sarcastic if the speaker is implying that people are not actually rich, and that the \"luxuries\" they are referring to are not really luxuries at all. However, it could also be a genuine statement if the speaker is contrasting the past with the present.\n\n(B) \"People these days are so rich. Back in my day we didn't have houses.\"\n- This statement is more likely to be sarcastic because it is highly unlikely that people in the past did not have houses. The statement exaggerates the situation to an absurd level, which is a common characteristic of sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses exaggeration to an unrealistic extent, which is a typical feature of sarcasm.\n\n<<<(B) People these days are so rich. Back in my day we didn't have houses>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) People these days are so rich.
