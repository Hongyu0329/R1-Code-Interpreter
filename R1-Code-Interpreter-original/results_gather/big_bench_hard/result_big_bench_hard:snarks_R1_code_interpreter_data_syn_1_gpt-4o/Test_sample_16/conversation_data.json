    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually for humorous or emphatic effect. \n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"He's such terrible relationship material when he's drunk\" - This statement is straightforward and likely reflects the speaker's genuine opinion. It doesn't seem to have the characteristics of sarcasm because it directly states a negative opinion.\n\n(B) \"He's such great relationship material when he's drunk\" - This statement is more likely to be sarcastic. Typically, being drunk is associated with negative behaviors that are not conducive to being good relationship material. Therefore, saying someone is \"great relationship material\" when drunk is likely the opposite of what the speaker truly believes, making it sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement.\n\n<<<(B) He's such great relationship material when he's drunk>>>"
