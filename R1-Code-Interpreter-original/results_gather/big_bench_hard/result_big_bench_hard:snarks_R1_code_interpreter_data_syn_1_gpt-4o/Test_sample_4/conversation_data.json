    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, typically in a mocking or ironic way. \n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different\"\n- The phrase \"totally different\" could be interpreted as sarcastic because urging and threatening can be seen as similar actions, depending on the context. The use of \"totally different\" might imply that the speaker actually believes they are not very different, thus using sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"He didn't threaten, he only pleaded; totally different\"\n- In this case, pleading and threatening are more distinct actions. Pleading is generally seen as a request or appeal, while threatening involves intimidation. The phrase \"totally different\" might be used sincerely here, as the two actions are indeed quite different.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because urging and threatening can be perceived as similar, and the phrase \"totally different\" could be used ironically to highlight their similarity.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(A) He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different>>>"
