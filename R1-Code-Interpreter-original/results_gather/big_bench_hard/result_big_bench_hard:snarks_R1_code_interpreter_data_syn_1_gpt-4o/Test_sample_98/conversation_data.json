    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical perception of Bitcoin as an investment.\n\n1. **Understanding Bitcoin as an Investment:**\n   - Bitcoin is generally considered a high-risk investment due to its volatility and the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies.\n   - People who are risk-averse typically avoid high-risk investments like Bitcoin.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Statements:**\n   - **Statement (A):** \"He doesn't want high risk investment? He should put it all on bitcoin!\"\n     - This statement suggests that someone who doesn't want high-risk investments should invest in Bitcoin, which is known to be high-risk. This is contradictory and thus likely sarcastic.\n   - **Statement (B):** \"He doesn't want low risk investment? He should put it all on bitcoin!\"\n     - This statement suggests that someone who doesn't want low-risk investments should invest in Bitcoin, which aligns with Bitcoin being high-risk. This is not contradictory and thus not sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement (A) is sarcastic because it contradicts the known risk profile of Bitcoin.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) He doesn't want high risk investment?
