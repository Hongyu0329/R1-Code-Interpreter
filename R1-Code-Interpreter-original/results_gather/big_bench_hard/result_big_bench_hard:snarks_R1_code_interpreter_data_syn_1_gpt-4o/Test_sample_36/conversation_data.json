    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical use of sarcasm. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually for humorous or emphatic effect. \n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n(A) \"Hey genocide is clearly the most rational decision\" - Genocide is a severe and universally condemned act. Describing it as \"the most rational decision\" is likely sarcastic because it contradicts the moral and ethical standards of rational decision-making.\n\n(B) \"Hey compromise is clearly the most rational decision\" - Compromise is generally seen as a rational and reasonable approach to resolving conflicts. Therefore, this statement is less likely to be sarcastic because it aligns with common perceptions of rationality.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses irony to highlight the absurdity of calling genocide a rational decision.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Hey genocide is clearly the most rational decision\n(B) Hey compromise is clearly the most rational decision\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
