    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the literal meaning of each statement and compare it to the expected or intended meaning.\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be easy.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: It suggests that the act of sneaking out with contraband is difficult.\n   - Expected Meaning: This aligns with the common understanding that such an act would indeed be challenging due to security measures.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal.\"\n   - Literal Meaning: It suggests that the act of sneaking out with contraband is not illegal.\n   - Expected Meaning: This contradicts the common understanding, as sneaking out with contraband is typically illegal.\n\nSarcasm often involves saying something that is opposite to what is true or expected, often for humorous or emphatic effect. In this case, Statement B is sarcastic because it implies that an obviously illegal act is not illegal, which is contrary to reality.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(B) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal>>>"
