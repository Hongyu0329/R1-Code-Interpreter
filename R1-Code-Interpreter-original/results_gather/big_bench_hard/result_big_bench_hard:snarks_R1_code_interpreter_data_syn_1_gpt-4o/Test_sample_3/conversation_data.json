    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of each option. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means, usually in a mocking or ironic way.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n(A) \"You are mistaken when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him.\"\n- This statement directly contradicts the idea that someone should let others get away with assault. It is straightforward and does not imply sarcasm. The speaker is clearly stating that the idea is wrong.\n\n(B) \"You are right when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him.\"\n- This statement seems to agree with the idea that someone should let others get away with assault. However, given the context, it is likely that the speaker does not genuinely believe this and is instead using sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of the idea.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it uses agreement in a context where agreement is unexpected or unreasonable, thus implying the opposite of what is stated.\n\n<<<(B) You are right when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him>>>"
