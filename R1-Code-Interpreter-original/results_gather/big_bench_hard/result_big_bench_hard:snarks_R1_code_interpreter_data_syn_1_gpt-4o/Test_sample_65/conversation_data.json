    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the typical cultural or religious practices associated with the statements.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement (A):** \"Muslims love celebrating Christmas\"\n     - Christmas is a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. While some Muslims may participate in Christmas festivities, it is not a religious holiday for Muslims, and traditionally, it is not celebrated by the Muslim community.\n   - **Statement (B):** \"Muslims love celebrating Eid\"\n     - Eid refers to two major Islamic festivals: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. These are significant religious holidays for Muslims, celebrated worldwide with various cultural and religious practices.\n\n2. **Analyzing for Sarcasm:**\n   - Sarcasm often involves saying something contrary to what is expected or true, often in a mocking or ironic way.\n   - Statement (A) could be sarcastic because it suggests that Muslims love celebrating a holiday that is not part of their religious tradition.\n   - Statement (B) is straightforward and aligns with the truth, as Muslims do celebrate Eid.\n\nBased on this analysis, Statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it presents an unexpected or contrary idea about Muslim practices.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n<<<(A) Muslims love celebrating Christmas>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Muslims love celebrating Christmas\n(B) Muslims love celebrating Eid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
