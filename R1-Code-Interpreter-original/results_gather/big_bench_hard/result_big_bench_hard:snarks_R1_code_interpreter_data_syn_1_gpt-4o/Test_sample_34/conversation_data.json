    "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the context and the language used in both options.\n\n1. **Option (A):** \"Her wheel wobbling several millimeters in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe.\"\n   - In this statement, the wobbling of the wheel is described as \"several millimeters,\" which is a small amount. It is reasonable to say that such a small wobble might not be enough to suggest that the bike is unsafe. Therefore, this statement is likely not sarcastic, as it aligns with a logical assessment of the situation.\n\n2. **Option (B):** \"Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe.\"\n   - In this statement, the wobbling of the wheel is described as \"several feet,\" which is a large and exaggerated amount. It is highly unlikely that a bike with a wheel wobbling several feet in either direction would be considered safe. The exaggeration here suggests that the statement is sarcastic, as it implies the opposite of what is being stated.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it uses exaggeration to imply that the bike is obviously unsafe, contrary to the literal meaning of the words.\n\n<<<(B) Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Which statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) Her wheel wobbling several millimeters in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe\n(B) Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
