    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n   - This means that everyone is either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap (or both).\n\n2. Premise 2: Nobody is neither a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n   - This means that everyone is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap (or both).\n\n3. Premise 3: Every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n   - This means that if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo (or both).\n\nConclusion: Being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap.\n   - This means that if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must also be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 3, if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they are either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n- From Premise 1, if someone is not a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is not a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\nTherefore, if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must satisfy one of the conditions in Premise 3. If they do not satisfy one of the conditions (frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo), they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap due to Premises 1 and 2.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
