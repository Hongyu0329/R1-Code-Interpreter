    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every ingredient of Sahara Saphire is both an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and an ingredient of Brushless Mascara.\n2. Premise 2: Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- Premise 1 states that if something is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire, then it must also be an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and Brushless Mascara. However, it does not state that every ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\n- Premise 2 states that Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap, but it does not provide any information about Cocamide being an ingredient of Brushless Mascara or Sahara Saphire.\n\nThe conclusion that Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire does not necessarily follow from the premises because the premises do not establish that every ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap is also an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
