    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap or not being a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is sufficient for being an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nLet's break down the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 2, we can express it as a logical implication:\n  - If (Nick is a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap OR Nick is NOT a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap), then Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know:\n  - Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n\n- The conclusion states:\n  - Nick is NOT an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the premises logically lead to the conclusion. \n\n- According to Premise 2, for Nick to be an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo, at least one of the following must be true:\n  - Nick is a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap.\n  - Nick is NOT a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n\n- However, Premise 1 states that Nick IS a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap, which means the second condition in the OR statement of Premise 2 is false.\n\n- Since the conclusion states that Nick is NOT an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo, it must be the case that Nick is NOT a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap, otherwise, the condition in Premise 2 would be satisfied, leading to Nick being an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nGiven this analysis, the premises logically lead to the conclusion, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
