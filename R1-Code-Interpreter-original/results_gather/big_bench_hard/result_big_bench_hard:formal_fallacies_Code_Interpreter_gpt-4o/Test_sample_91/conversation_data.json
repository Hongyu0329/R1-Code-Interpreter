    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First premise**: Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n2. **Second premise**: Oliver is not a supporter of FC Viitorul.\n3. **Third premise**: Every supporter of SK Rapid Wien is neither a supporter of FC Viitorul nor an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n\n**Conclusion**: It is false that Oliver is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nTo check for deductive validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- From the third premise, we know that if someone is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien, they cannot be a supporter of FC Viitorul and cannot be an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n- Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz (first premise) and is not a supporter of FC Viitorul (second premise).\n\nThe premises do not provide any information that directly contradicts Oliver being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien. The premises only state conditions that are met by Oliver (he is not an opponent to FC Vaduz and not a supporter of FC Viitorul), which are consistent with being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"it is false that Oliver is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien\" does not necessarily follow from the premises. The argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
