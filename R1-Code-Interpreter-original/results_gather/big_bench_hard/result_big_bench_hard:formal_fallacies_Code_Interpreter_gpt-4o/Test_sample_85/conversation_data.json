    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Everyone who is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi is a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n2. Premise 2: Every close friend of Kathryn is a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n3. Conclusion: Whoever is none of this: a cousin of Valerie or classmate of Mitzi, is a workmate of Anita.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, they must be either a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a close friend of Kathryn, they must be either a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, they must be a workmate of Anita.\n\nTo check the validity, consider the following:\n\n- If someone is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, according to Premise 1, they must be a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n- If they are a close friend of Kathryn, according to Premise 2, they must be a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie, which contradicts the initial condition (neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi).\n- Therefore, the only possibility left is that they must be a workmate of Anita.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
