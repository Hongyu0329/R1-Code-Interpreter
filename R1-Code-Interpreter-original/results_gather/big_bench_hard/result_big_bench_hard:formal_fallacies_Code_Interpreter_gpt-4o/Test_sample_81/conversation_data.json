    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Every ex-fan of FC Bayern München is a follower of Rangers FC.\n   - This can be written as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München, then they are a follower of Rangers FC.\n\n2. Being a follower of Rangers FC is necessary for being a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n   - This can be written as: If someone is a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, then they are a follower of Rangers FC.\n\n3. Whoever is neither a member of FC Mariupol nor an expert of Stade Rennais FC is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n   - This can be written as: If someone is not a member of FC Mariupol and not an expert of Stade Rennais FC, then they are an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n\nConclusion:\n- Not being a follower of Rangers FC is sufficient for being a member of FC Mariupol or not being an expert of Stade Rennais FC.\n  - This can be written as: If someone is not a follower of Rangers FC, then they are a member of FC Mariupol or not an expert of Stade Rennais FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From premise 1, if someone is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München, they must be a follower of Rangers FC.\n- From premise 2, if someone is a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, they must be a follower of Rangers FC.\n- From premise 3, if someone is neither a member of FC Mariupol nor an expert of Stade Rennais FC, they must be either an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, which means they must be a follower of Rangers FC (from premises 1 and 2).\n\nThe conclusion states that if someone is not a follower of Rangers FC, then they must be a member of FC Mariupol or not an expert of Stade Rennais FC. This is logically consistent with the premises because if someone is not a follower of Rangers FC, they cannot be an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, which means they must be either a member of FC Mariupol or not an expert of Stade Rennais FC to satisfy premise 3.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
