    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states:\n1. No son of Alexander who is an ancestor of Ahmed is a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- No great-grandfather of Ronny is an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- The premise tells us that if someone is both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed, then they cannot be a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n- The conclusion states that if someone is a great-grandfather of Ronny, then they cannot be an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n\nThe conclusion is essentially a contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
