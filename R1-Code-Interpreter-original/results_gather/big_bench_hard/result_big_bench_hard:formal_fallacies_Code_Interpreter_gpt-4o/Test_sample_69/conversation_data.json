    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a stepbrother of Benjamin is necessary for being a grandson of Alan.\n   - This means if someone is a grandson of Alan, then they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every half-brother of Melvin is a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n   - This means if someone is a half-brother of Melvin, then they are also a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Everyone who is not a cousin of Solomon and not a stepbrother of Dominic is a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin.\n   - This means if someone is neither a cousin of Solomon nor a stepbrother of Dominic, then they must be either a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin.\n\n**Conclusion**: Someone who is not a stepbrother of Benjamin is a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is a grandson of Alan, they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a half-brother of Melvin, they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n- From Premise 3, if someone is neither a cousin of Solomon nor a stepbrother of Dominic, they must be either a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin, which means they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin (from Premises 1 and 2).\n\nTherefore, if someone is not a stepbrother of Benjamin, they cannot be a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin. Thus, they must be either a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
