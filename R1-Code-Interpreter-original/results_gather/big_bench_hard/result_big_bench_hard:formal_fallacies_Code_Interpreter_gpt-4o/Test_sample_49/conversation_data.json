    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: No ex-supporter of Getafe CF is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n2. Premise 2: Everyone who is a friend of R. Charleroi SC is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n3. Conclusion: Whoever is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nLet's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they are a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- From Premise 1, we know that ex-supporters of Getafe CF cannot be critics of Kilmarnock FC.\n- The conclusion claims that if someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they must be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nTo test the validity, consider the contrapositive of Premise 2: If someone is not a critic of Kilmarnock FC, then they are not a friend of R. Charleroi SC. \n\nNow, if someone is not a critic of Kilmarnock FC (from the contrapositive of Premise 2), they could be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF (from Premise 1). However, the conclusion claims that anyone who is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF, which is not necessarily true based on the premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
