    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. Premise: Not being an opponent to FC Utrecht is sufficient for not being an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: If a person is not an opponent to FC Utrecht, then they are not an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\n   - In logical terms: If not Opponent(FC Utrecht), then not Admirer(St Johnstone FC).\n\n2. Conclusion: Everyone who is an admirer of St Johnstone FC is an opponent to FC Utrecht.\n   - In logical terms: If Admirer(St Johnstone FC), then Opponent(FC Utrecht).\n\nTo check for deductive validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if someone is not an opponent of FC Utrecht, they cannot be an admirer of St Johnstone FC. This implies that if someone is an admirer of St Johnstone FC, they must be an opponent of FC Utrecht (otherwise, the premise would be violated).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
