    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Whoever is an uncle of Owen is not a nephew of Gene.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David is a schoolmate of Steve or an uncle of Owen.\n3. Premise 3: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Steve is a nephew of Gene.\n\nConclusion: Every brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is not a nephew of Gene.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David, they are either a schoolmate of Steve or an uncle of Owen.\n- From Premise 3, if they are a schoolmate of Steve, they are a nephew of Gene.\n- From Premise 1, if they are an uncle of Owen, they are not a nephew of Gene.\n\nThe conclusion states that every brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is not a nephew of Gene. \n\nFor the conclusion to be true, every individual who is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David must be an uncle of Owen (and thus not a nephew of Gene, according to Premise 1). However, Premise 2 allows for the possibility that such an individual could be a schoolmate of Steve, which would make them a nephew of Gene (according to Premise 3).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, as there is a possibility that a brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio could be a schoolmate of Steve and thus a nephew of Gene.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
