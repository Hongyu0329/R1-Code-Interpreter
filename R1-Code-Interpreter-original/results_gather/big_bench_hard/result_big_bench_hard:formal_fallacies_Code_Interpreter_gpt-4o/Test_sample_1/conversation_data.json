    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise: Being a cousin of Chris is sufficient for not being a son of Kermit.\n2. Conclusion: Whoever is not a son of Kermit is a cousin of Chris.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- The premise states that if someone is a cousin of Chris, then they are not a son of Kermit. This can be represented as: \n  - If \\( C \\) (cousin of Chris), then \\( \\neg K \\) (not a son of Kermit).\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a son of Kermit, then they are a cousin of Chris. This can be represented as:\n  - If \\( \\neg K \\), then \\( C \\).\n\nThe premise provides a sufficient condition for not being a son of Kermit, but it does not provide a necessary condition. The conclusion, however, assumes that not being a son of Kermit is a sufficient condition for being a cousin of Chris, which is not supported by the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
