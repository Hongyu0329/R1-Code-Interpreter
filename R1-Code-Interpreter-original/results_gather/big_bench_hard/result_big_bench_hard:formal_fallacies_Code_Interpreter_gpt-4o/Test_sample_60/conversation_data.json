    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n2. Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an opponent to OGC Nice.\n3. Some fan of Burnley FC is an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n\nConclusion: Some fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows from the premises, let's consider the logical structure:\n\n- Premises 1 and 2 define characteristics of experts of PFC Ludogorets 1945: they are both ex-fans of KF Skënderbeu and opponents to OGC Nice.\n- Premise 3 states that there exists a fan of Burnley FC who is both an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n\nThe conclusion claims that this fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945. \n\nFor the conclusion to be valid, the characteristics of the fan of Burnley FC (being an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu) must be sufficient to classify them as an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945. However, the premises do not state that these characteristics are exclusive to experts of PFC Ludogorets 1945. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid<<<answer>>>"
