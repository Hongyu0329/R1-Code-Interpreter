    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. First premise: It is not the case that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Nobility.\n2. Second premise: It is false that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core.\n3. Third premise: Every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is neither an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core nor an ingredient of Nobility.\n\nConclusion: Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- From the first and second premises, we know that Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of either Nobility or Cover Pink, Core.\n- The third premise states that every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is neither an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core nor an ingredient of Nobility.\n\nSince Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of either Cover Pink, Core or Nobility, it cannot be an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry, according to the third premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
