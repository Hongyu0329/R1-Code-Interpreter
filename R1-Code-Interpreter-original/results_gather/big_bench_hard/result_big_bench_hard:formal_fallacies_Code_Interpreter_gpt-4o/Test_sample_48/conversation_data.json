    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\n2. Premise 2: Being a niece of Shona is sufficient for not being a daughter of Hattie.\n3. Conclusion: Carmen is not a niece of Shona.\n\nA deductively valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 states that Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is a niece of Shona, then they cannot be a daughter of Hattie.\n\nGiven these premises, if Carmen is a daughter of Hattie (Premise 1), then according to Premise 2, she cannot be a niece of Shona. Therefore, the conclusion that \"Carmen is not a niece of Shona\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
