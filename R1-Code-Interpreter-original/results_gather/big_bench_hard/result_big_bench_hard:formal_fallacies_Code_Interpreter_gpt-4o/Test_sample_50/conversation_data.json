    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every aunt of Rosa who is a sister of Amanda is also a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n2. Premise 2: It is not the case that Amy is an aunt of Rosa.\n3. Premise 3: Amy is a sister of Amanda.\n4. Conclusion: Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda, then they are a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n- Premise 2 states that Amy is not an aunt of Rosa. Therefore, Amy does not satisfy the condition of being both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda.\n- Since Amy does not satisfy the condition in Premise 1, Premise 1 does not apply to her, and we cannot conclude anything about her being a great-grandmother of Hellen based solely on Premise 1.\n- The conclusion states that Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen. However, the premises do not provide information about whether Amy could be a great-grandmother of Hellen through other means or relationships.\n\nThe argument is invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The premises do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n\n<<<answer: invalid>>>"
