    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Whoever is not a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo is not a rare consumer of South of France soap or not a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: \n     \\[\n     \\neg R_P \\rightarrow (\\neg R_S \\lor \\neg R_K)\n     \\]\n     where \\( R_P \\) is being a regular consumer of Pantene, \\( R_S \\) is being a rare consumer of South of France soap, and \\( R_K \\) is being a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Being a rare consumer of South of France soap is necessary for not being a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\neg F_{Pr} \\rightarrow R_S\n     \\]\n     where \\( F_{Pr} \\) is being a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap nor a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\neg ( \\neg F_{Pr} \\land \\neg R_K )\n     \\]\n     which is equivalent to:\n     \\[\n     F_{Pr} \\lor R_K\n     \\]\n\n**Conclusion**: Whoever is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap is a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo.\n\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\neg F_{Pr} \\rightarrow R_P\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the second premise, \\(\\neg F_{Pr} \\rightarrow R_S\\).\n- From the third premise, \\(F_{Pr} \\lor R_K\\), which implies \\(\\neg F_{Pr} \\rightarrow R_K\\).\n- Combining these, if \\(\\neg F_{Pr}\\), then both \\(R_S\\) and \\(R_K\\) must be true.\n- From the first premise, \\(\\neg R_P \\rightarrow (\\neg R_S \\lor \\neg R_K)\\).\n- If \\(\\neg R_P\\), then either \\(\\neg R_S\\) or \\(\\neg R_K\\) must be true, which contradicts the requirement that both \\(R_S\\) and \\(R_K\\) are true when \\(\\neg F_{Pr}\\).\n\nThus, if \\(\\neg F_{Pr}\\), \\(\\neg R_P\\) leads to a contradiction, so \\(\\neg F_{Pr} \\rightarrow R_P\\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
