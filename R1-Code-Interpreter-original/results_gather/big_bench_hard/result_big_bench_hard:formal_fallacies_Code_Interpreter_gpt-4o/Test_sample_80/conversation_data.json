    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Whoever is not a workmate of Hilda is a stepsister of Heather.\n2. Premise 2: Every workmate of Hilda is either a stepsister of Heather or an aunt of Clara, or both.\n3. Conclusion: Being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 states that if someone is not a workmate of Hilda, then they must be a stepsister of Heather. This does not provide any direct information about the relationship between being a workmate of Hilda and being an aunt of Clara.\n\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is a workmate of Hilda, then they must be either a stepsister of Heather, an aunt of Clara, or both. This means that being a workmate of Hilda does not necessarily require being an aunt of Clara, as one could be a stepsister of Heather instead.\n\nThe conclusion claims that being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda. However, according to Premise 2, being a workmate of Hilda could also be satisfied by being a stepsister of Heather, without necessarily being an aunt of Clara.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
