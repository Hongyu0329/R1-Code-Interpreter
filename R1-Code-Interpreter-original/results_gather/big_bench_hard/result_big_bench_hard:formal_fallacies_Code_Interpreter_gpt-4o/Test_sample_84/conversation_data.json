The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, not being an ingredient of Pink Smoothie is sufficient for not being an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.

    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Not being an ingredient of Pink Smoothie is sufficient for not being an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This means if something is not in Pink Smoothie, it is not in A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\n2. Premise 2: Everything that is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This means if something is in ILLUMINIZING POWDER, it is also in A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\nConclusion: Every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 2, if something is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER, it must be an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- From Premise 1, if something is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, it must also be an ingredient of Pink Smoothie (since not being in Pink Smoothie means not being in A.D LIPSTICK CHIC).\n\nHowever, Premise 1 actually states the opposite: if something is not in Pink Smoothie, it is not in A.D LIPSTICK CHIC. This does not imply that if something is in A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, it must be in Pink Smoothie. Therefore, the conclusion that every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
