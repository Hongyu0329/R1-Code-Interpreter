    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a workmate of Monte is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a workmate of Monte, then they are an ancestor of Patrick.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Not being an ancestor of Nathan is sufficient for not being a workmate of Monte.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, then they are not a workmate of Monte.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an ancestor of Nathan is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, then they are an ancestor of Patrick.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the second premise, if someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, they are not a workmate of Monte.\n- From the first premise, if someone is not a workmate of Monte, they are an ancestor of Patrick.\n\nCombining these two premises:\n- If someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, then they are not a workmate of Monte (second premise).\n- If they are not a workmate of Monte, then they are an ancestor of Patrick (first premise).\n\nThus, if someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, they are an ancestor of Patrick, which matches the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
