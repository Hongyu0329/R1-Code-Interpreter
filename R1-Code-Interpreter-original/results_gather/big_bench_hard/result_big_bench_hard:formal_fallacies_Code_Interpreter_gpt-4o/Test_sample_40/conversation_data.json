    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n2. Premise 2: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir or a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n3. Conclusion: Every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a critic of FC Ufa, they must be a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n- Premise 2 states that every critic of FC Ufa is either a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir, a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva, or an expert of Randers FC. However, since Premise 1 already establishes that every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir, Premise 2 does not add any new information about critics of FC Ufa.\n- The conclusion claims that every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC. However, based on Premise 1, we only know that they are supporters of İstanbul Başakşehir, and there is no information linking them to being critics of PFC CSKA Moskva or experts of Randers FC.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
