    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Nobody is neither an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap nor an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n   This premise can be interpreted as: Everyone is either an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap or an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap (or both).\n\n2. **Second Premise**: No owner of an Aveeno shampoo who is an infrequent user of Zest soap is an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n   This premise states that if someone owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap, they cannot be an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is an owner of an Aveeno shampoo and an infrequent user of Zest soap is also an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\n\n   The conclusion claims that if someone owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that everyone must be an occasional purchaser of either Yardley London soap or Paul Mitchell soap.\n- From the second premise, we know that owners of Aveeno shampoo who are infrequent users of Zest soap cannot be occasional purchasers of Paul Mitchell soap.\n- Therefore, based on these two premises, such individuals must be occasional purchasers of Yardley London soap, as they cannot be occasional purchasers of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
