    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Everyone who is a close friend of Glenna is a close friend of Tamara.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Glenna.\n3. Conclusion: Whoever is none of this: a half-sister of Deborah or workmate of Nila, is a close friend of Tamara.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Glenna.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a close friend of Glenna, then they are a close friend of Tamara.\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can deduce that if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Tamara. This is exactly what the conclusion states.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
