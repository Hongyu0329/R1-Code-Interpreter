    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: No member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is a follower of OGC Nice.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is not a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC.\n3. Premise 3: Every member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC or a backer of FC Zenit or a follower of OGC Nice.\n\nConclusion: Being a backer of FC Zenit is necessary for being a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that members of ŠK Slovan Bratislava cannot be followers of OGC Nice.\n- From Premise 2, we know that members of ŠK Slovan Bratislava cannot be devotees of Royal Antwerp FC.\n- Premise 3 states that every member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava must be one of the following: a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC, a backer of FC Zenit, or a follower of OGC Nice.\n\nGiven Premise 1 and Premise 2, members of ŠK Slovan Bratislava cannot be followers of OGC Nice or devotees of Royal Antwerp FC. Therefore, the only option left for members of ŠK Slovan Bratislava, according to Premise 3, is to be a backer of FC Zenit.\n\nThus, the conclusion that being a backer of FC Zenit is necessary for being a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
