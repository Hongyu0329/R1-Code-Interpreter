    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n2. Premise 2: Every ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml is not an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n3. Conclusion: It is not the case that Vitamin A is an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the conclusion must logically follow from the premises. Let's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n- Premise 2 states that for any ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it cannot be an ingredient of both Mango Lip Butter and LIQUID EYELINER. In other words, if an ingredient is in BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it must not be in LIQUID EYELINER.\n\nGiven these premises, if Vitamin A were an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it would contradict Premise 2 because Vitamin A is already an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER. Therefore, the conclusion that Vitamin A is not an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
