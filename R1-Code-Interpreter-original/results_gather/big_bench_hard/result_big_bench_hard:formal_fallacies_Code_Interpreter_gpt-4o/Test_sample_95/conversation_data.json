  "question": "\"Is Siri a stepsister of Mary? Is Susan related to Kate? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, being a close friend of Catherine is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie. Now, being a granddaughter of Courtney is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie. Moreover, whoever is not a classmate of Mary is however a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney. In consequence, whoever is not a classmate of Leslie is a classmate of Mary.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a close friend of Catherine is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie.\n   - This means if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, then they must be a close friend of Catherine.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a granddaughter of Courtney is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie.\n   - This means if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, then they must be a granddaughter of Courtney.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is not a classmate of Mary is a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n   - This means if someone is not a classmate of Mary, then they must be either a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a classmate of Leslie is a classmate of Mary.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we know that if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be both a close friend of Catherine and a granddaughter of Courtney.\n- Premise 3 states that if someone is not a classmate of Mary, they must be either a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they are a classmate of Mary.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- If someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be both a close friend of Catherine and a granddaughter of Courtney (from Premises 1 and 2).\n- If they are both a close friend of Catherine and a granddaughter of Courtney, they cannot be not a classmate of Mary (from Premise 3), meaning they must be a classmate of Mary.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
