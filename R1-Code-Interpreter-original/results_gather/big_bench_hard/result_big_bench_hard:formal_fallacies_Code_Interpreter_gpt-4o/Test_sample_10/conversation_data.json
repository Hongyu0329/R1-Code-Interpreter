    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: No member of Juventus is an expert of Getafe CF.\n2. Premise 2: Somebody is a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF.\n3. Conclusion: Not every follower of West Ham United FC is a member of Juventus.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a member of Juventus, they cannot be an expert of Getafe CF.\n- From Premise 2, we know there exists at least one person who is both a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF.\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion \"Not every follower of West Ham United FC is a member of Juventus\" must be true because the person who is both a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF cannot be a member of Juventus (as per Premise 1). Therefore, there is at least one follower of West Ham United FC who is not a member of Juventus.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
