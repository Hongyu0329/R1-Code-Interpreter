Next, being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ. Plus,being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.

    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. Some backer of BSC Young Boys is a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n2. Being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n3. Being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- There is somebody who is a backer of BSC Young Boys and an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nLogical Analysis:\n\n- From premise 2, if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, then they are a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n- From premise 3, if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, then they must be an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- Premise 1 states that there is a backer of BSC Young Boys who is both a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\nTo satisfy all premises, the backer of BSC Young Boys who is a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen must also be an ex-fan of NK Maribor, as being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
