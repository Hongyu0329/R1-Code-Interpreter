    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap is necessary for being a regular user of Nag Champa soap.\n   - This means if someone is a regular user of Nag Champa soap, they must also be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is at least one of these: a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n   - This means if someone is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo, they must be a regular consumer of at least one of the three products mentioned.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: No regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap is a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - This means if someone is a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, they cannot be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n**Conclusion**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the second premise, a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo must be a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n- If they are a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, by the third premise, they cannot be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- If they are a regular user of Nag Champa soap, by the first premise, they must be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap, which contradicts the conclusion.\n- Therefore, to satisfy the conclusion, they must be a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n\nThe conclusion states that a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo. However, based on the premises, if they are not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap, they must be a regular user of René Furterer shampoo, which contradicts the conclusion.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
