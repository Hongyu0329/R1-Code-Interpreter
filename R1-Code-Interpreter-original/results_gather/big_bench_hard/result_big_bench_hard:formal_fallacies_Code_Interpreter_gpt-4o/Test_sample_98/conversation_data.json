    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Andres is a member of Paris Saint-Germain.\n2. Premise 2: It is false that Andres is a follower of FC Mariupol.\n3. Premise 3: Whoever is a follower of FC Mariupol and a member of Paris Saint-Germain is also a devotee of FC Arouca.\n4. Conclusion: Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- Premise 3 states that only those who are both followers of FC Mariupol and members of Paris Saint-Germain are devotees of FC Arouca.\n- Premise 2 states that Andres is not a follower of FC Mariupol.\n- Therefore, Andres does not meet the condition in Premise 3 to be a devotee of FC Arouca.\n\nSince the conclusion that \"Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca\" logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
