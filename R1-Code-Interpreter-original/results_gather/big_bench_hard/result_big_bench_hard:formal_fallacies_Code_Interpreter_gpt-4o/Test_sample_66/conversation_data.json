    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: It is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n2. Premise 2: Everything that is an ingredient of Chickadee is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n3. Conclusion: It is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Chickadee.\n\nTo assess the validity, we need to determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Coffee bean extract is not in Go 365 Shampoo.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if something is an ingredient of Chickadee, it must also be an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n\nIf Coffee bean extract were an ingredient of Chickadee, then by Premise 2, it would also have to be an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo. However, this contradicts Premise 1, which states that Coffee bean extract is not an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Coffee bean extract is not an ingredient of Chickadee necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
