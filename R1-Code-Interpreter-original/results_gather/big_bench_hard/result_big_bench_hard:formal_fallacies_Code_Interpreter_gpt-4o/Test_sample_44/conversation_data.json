    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. Premise 1: Whatever is both an ingredient of Immense Mascara and an ingredient of I Adore You is an ingredient of Crawford's Wine or an ingredient of Bioglitz Color 9N.\n\n2. Premise 2: Being an ingredient of lip2cheek is necessary for being an ingredient of Bioglitz Color 9N.\n\n3. Premise 3: Everything that is an ingredient of Crawford's Wine is an ingredient of lip2cheek.\n\nConclusion: Whatever is an ingredient of Immense Mascara and an ingredient of I Adore You is also an ingredient of lip2cheek.\n\nLet's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if something is an ingredient of both Immense Mascara and I Adore You, it must be an ingredient of either Crawford's Wine or Bioglitz Color 9N.\n- From Premise 2, if something is an ingredient of Bioglitz Color 9N, it must also be an ingredient of lip2cheek.\n- From Premise 3, if something is an ingredient of Crawford's Wine, it must also be an ingredient of lip2cheek.\n\nTherefore, if something is an ingredient of both Immense Mascara and I Adore You, it must be an ingredient of either Crawford's Wine or Bioglitz Color 9N, and in either case, it must also be an ingredient of lip2cheek.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
