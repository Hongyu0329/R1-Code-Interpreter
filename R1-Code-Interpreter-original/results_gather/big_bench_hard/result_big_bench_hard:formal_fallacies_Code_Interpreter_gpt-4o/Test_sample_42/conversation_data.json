    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the logical relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise: Every ingredient of Moisturizing Bar is neither an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR nor an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM.\n2. Conclusion: Whatever is none of this: an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM or an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR, is an ingredient of Moisturizing Bar.\n\nThe premise states that the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar are distinct from those of the 31 EYE COLOUR and VITAMIN E BB CREAM. The conclusion claims that anything that is not an ingredient of either the 31 EYE COLOUR or the VITAMIN E BB CREAM must be an ingredient of the Moisturizing Bar.\n\nThe argument assumes that the set of ingredients for the Moisturizing Bar is the complement of the union of the sets of ingredients for the 31 EYE COLOUR and VITAMIN E BB CREAM. However, the premise only states that the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar are not in the other two products, not that they are the only other ingredients possible.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
