    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Whoever is an expert of BSC Young Boys is not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is not an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n3. Conclusion: No friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\nTo assess the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is an expert of BSC Young Boys, they cannot be an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\nCombining these two premises:\n- A friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys (Premise 2).\n- Therefore, a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv cannot be someone who is not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié (since they cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys).\n\nThus, the conclusion that no friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
