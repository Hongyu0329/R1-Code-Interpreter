    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, then it is either not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n\n2. Premise 2: Everything that is an ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch.\n   - This means that if something is an ingredient of Black Shadow, it is also an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch.\n\nConclusion: Every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm and an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone?.\n\nLet's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that every ingredient of Black Shadow is also an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch.\n- According to Premise 1, every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is either not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n- Therefore, an ingredient of Black Shadow, being an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, cannot be an ingredient of both Ice Queen Anyone? and Exfoliating Balm simultaneously.\n\nThe conclusion states that every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of both Exfoliating Balm and Ice Queen Anyone?, which contradicts the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
