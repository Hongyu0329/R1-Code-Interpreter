    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\n2. Premise 2: Nobody is neither a schoolmate of Tyler nor a nephew of Owen.\n\nThe second premise can be rephrased using logical terms: \"If someone is not a schoolmate of Tyler, then they are a nephew of Owen.\"\n\n3. Conclusion: Cecil is not a nephew of Owen.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is not a schoolmate of Tyler, then they are a nephew of Owen. The contrapositive of this statement is: \"If someone is not a nephew of Owen, then they are a schoolmate of Tyler.\"\n\nSince Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler (Premise 1), the contrapositive of Premise 2 does not provide any new information about Cecil's status as a nephew of Owen. Therefore, the conclusion that \"Cecil is not a nephew of Owen\" does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<answer: invalid>>>"
