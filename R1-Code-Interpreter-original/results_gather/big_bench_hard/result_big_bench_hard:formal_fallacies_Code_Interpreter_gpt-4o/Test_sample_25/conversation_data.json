    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the given premise and the conclusion.\n\n**Premise:**\n- Nobody is neither a workmate of Calvin nor a schoolmate of Barton.\n\nThis premise can be rephrased using logical terms:\n- For any person, it is not the case that they are neither a workmate of Calvin nor a schoolmate of Barton.\n- In other words, for any person, they must be either a workmate of Calvin or a schoolmate of Barton (or both).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Being a workmate of Calvin is necessary for not being a schoolmate of Barton.\n\nThe conclusion states that if someone is not a schoolmate of Barton, then they must be a workmate of Calvin.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The premise states that everyone is either a workmate of Calvin or a schoolmate of Barton.\n- The conclusion claims that if someone is not a schoolmate of Barton, then they must be a workmate of Calvin.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because:\n- If a person is not a schoolmate of Barton, the premise requires that they must be a workmate of Calvin (since they must be one or the other).\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
