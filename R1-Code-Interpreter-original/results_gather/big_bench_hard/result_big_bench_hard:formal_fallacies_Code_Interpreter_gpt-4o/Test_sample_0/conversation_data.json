    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise: Whoever is a schoolmate of Sondra is not a stepsister of Pricilla.\n2. Conclusion: Whoever is not a stepsister of Pricilla is a schoolmate of Sondra.\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- The first premise states that being a schoolmate of Sondra implies not being a stepsister of Pricilla. In logical terms, this can be expressed as: \n  - If \\( A \\) (is a schoolmate of Sondra), then \\( \\neg B \\) (is not a stepsister of Pricilla).\n\n- The conclusion states that not being a stepsister of Pricilla implies being a schoolmate of Sondra. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n  - If \\( \\neg B \\) (is not a stepsister of Pricilla), then \\( A \\) (is a schoolmate of Sondra).\n\nThe conclusion is essentially the converse of the premise. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. Therefore, the argument is not deductively valid.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
