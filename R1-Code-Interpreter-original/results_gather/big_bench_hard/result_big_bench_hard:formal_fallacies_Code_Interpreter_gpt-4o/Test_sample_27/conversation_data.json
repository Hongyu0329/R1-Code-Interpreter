    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every schoolmate of Jeffery is a grandson of Todd.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is a schoolmate of Jeffery is at least one of these: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern.\n3. Premise 3: Every schoolmate of Jeffery is an uncle of Lavern.\n\nConclusion: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Jeffery is a brother of Kenneth, too.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 states that all schoolmates of Jeffery are grandsons of Todd.\n- Premise 2 states that all schoolmates of Jeffery must be at least one of the following: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern.\n- Premise 3 states that all schoolmates of Jeffery are uncles of Lavern.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that all schoolmates of Jeffery are grandsons of Todd. From Premise 3, we know that all schoolmates of Jeffery are uncles of Lavern. \n\nHowever, the conclusion states that all schoolmates of Jeffery are brothers of Kenneth. There is no premise that directly supports this conclusion. The premises only establish that schoolmates of Jeffery are grandsons of Todd and uncles of Lavern, but not necessarily brothers of Kenneth.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
