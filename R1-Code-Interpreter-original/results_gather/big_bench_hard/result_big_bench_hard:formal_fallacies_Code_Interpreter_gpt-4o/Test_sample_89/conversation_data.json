    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Justin is not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn.\n2. Premise 2: Every great-grandfather of Reyes is an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\n3. Conclusion: It is not the case that Justin is a great-grandfather of Reyes.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a great-grandfather of Reyes, then they must be both an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\n- Premise 1 states that Justin is either not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn. This means that Justin does not satisfy the condition required to be a great-grandfather of Reyes (as per Premise 2).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Justin is not a great-grandfather of Reyes logically follows from the premises. The argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
