Now, every frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is neither a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo. We may conclude that everyone who is not both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is however a regular user of Mysore soap.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Everyone who is both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap or a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n2. Premise 2: Every frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is neither a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\nConclusion: Everyone who is not both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\nLet's analyze the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences, they must be either a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine or a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine, they cannot be both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences.\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences, they must be a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\nThe premises imply that if someone is both a rare consumer of Pantene and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences, they must be a regular user of Mysore soap (since they cannot be a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine due to Premise 2). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
