    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Terry is a grandson of Ward.\n2. **Second Premise**: Every grandson of Paul is an uncle of Earl and a grandson of Ward.\n\n**Conclusion**: Terry is a grandson of Paul.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- From the first premise, we know Terry is a grandson of Ward.\n- The second premise states that every grandson of Paul is also a grandson of Ward. However, it does not state that every grandson of Ward is a grandson of Paul. Therefore, being a grandson of Ward does not necessarily mean being a grandson of Paul.\n\nThe conclusion that Terry is a grandson of Paul does not necessarily follow from the premises, as there could be grandsons of Ward who are not grandsons of Paul.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
