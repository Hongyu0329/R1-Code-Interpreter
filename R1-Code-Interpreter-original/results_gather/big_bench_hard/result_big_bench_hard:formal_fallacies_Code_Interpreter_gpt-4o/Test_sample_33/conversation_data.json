    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise: Whatever is an ingredient of Vertica Rush and an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n2. Conclusion: Every ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.\n\nLet's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The premise states that if something is an ingredient of both Vertica Rush and Liqua Versa Gel, then it cannot be an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n- The conclusion states that if something is an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad, then it cannot be an ingredient of both Liqua Versa Gel and Vertica Rush.\n\nThe conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
