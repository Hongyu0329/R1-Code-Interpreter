    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise: Every close friend of Myra is neither a cousin of Sue nor a daughter of Tommy.\n2. Conclusion: No cousin of Sue and no daughter of Tommy is a close friend of Myra.\n\nThe premise states that if someone is a close friend of Myra, then they cannot be a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy. The conclusion states that if someone is a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy, then they cannot be a close friend of Myra.\n\nThe conclusion is essentially a restatement of the premise in a logically equivalent form. The premise and conclusion are contrapositives of each other:\n\n- Premise: If A (close friend of Myra), then not B (cousin of Sue) and not C (daughter of Tommy).\n- Conclusion: If B (cousin of Sue) or C (daughter of Tommy), then not A (not a close friend of Myra).\n\nSince the conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
