    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: It is false that Colleen is an ancestor of Cheryle.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is a stepsister of Esther is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n3. Conclusion: It follows that it is false that Colleen is a stepsister of Esther.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a stepsister of Esther, then they cannot be an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- Premise 1 states that Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n\nThe conclusion states that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther. For the argument to be valid, the conclusion must be the only logical outcome given the premises.\n\nIf Colleen were a stepsister of Esther, then according to Premise 2, she would not be an ancestor of Cheryle, which is consistent with Premise 1. Therefore, the conclusion that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther does not necessarily follow from the premises, as there is no contradiction if Colleen were a stepsister of Esther.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
