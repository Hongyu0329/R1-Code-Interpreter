    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. Premise 1: It is not the case that Homer is a classmate of Frank.\n2. Premise 2: Being a classmate of Edward is necessary for being a classmate of Frank.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer:\n\n- If someone is a classmate of Frank, then they must be a classmate of Edward (from Premise 2).\n\nSince Homer is not a classmate of Frank (Premise 1), it follows that Homer cannot be a classmate of Edward. This is because being a classmate of Edward is a necessary condition for being a classmate of Frank, and Homer does not meet this condition.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"necessarily, it is not the case that Homer is a classmate of Edward\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
