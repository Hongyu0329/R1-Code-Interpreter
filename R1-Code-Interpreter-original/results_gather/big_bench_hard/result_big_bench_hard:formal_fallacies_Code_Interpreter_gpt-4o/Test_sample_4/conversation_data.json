    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being an expert of Aberdeen FC is sufficient for not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Every expert of Aberdeen FC is not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or they are not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is an expert of Aberdeen FC is not a fan of AZ Alkmaar.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are not a fan of AZ Alkmaar.\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n- From the first premise, we know that being an expert of Aberdeen FC means not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n- The second premise states that an expert of Aberdeen FC is either not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid. Given the first premise, we know that they are not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid, which satisfies the \"or\" condition in the second premise.\n\nHowever, the conclusion that an expert of Aberdeen FC is not a fan of AZ Alkmaar does not necessarily follow from the premises. The second premise allows for the possibility that an expert of Aberdeen FC could still be a fan of AZ Alkmaar, as long as they are not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid, which is already established by the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<answer>>>invalid<<<answer>>>"
