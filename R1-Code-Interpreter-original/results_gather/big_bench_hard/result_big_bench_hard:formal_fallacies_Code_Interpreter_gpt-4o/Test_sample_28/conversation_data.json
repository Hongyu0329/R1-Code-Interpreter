    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Aquablush is sufficient for being an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n   - This means: If X is an ingredient of Aquablush, then X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whatever is neither an ingredient of Stop and Stare nor an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or an ingredient of Aquablush.\n   - This means: If X is not an ingredient of Stop and Stare and X is not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, then X is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or X is an ingredient of Aquablush.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Everything that is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n   - This means: If X is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara, then X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n\n**Conclusion**: Whatever is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow is however an ingredient of Stop and Stare or an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This means: If X is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow, then X is an ingredient of Stop and Stare or X is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\nNow, let's analyze if the conclusion follows from the premises:\n\n- From Premise 1, if X is an ingredient of Aquablush, then X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n- From Premise 3, if X is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara, then X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n- From Premise 2, if X is not an ingredient of Stop and Stare and not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, then X is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or Aquablush, which means X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow (from Premises 1 and 3).\n\nTherefore, if X is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow, it cannot be an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or Aquablush. Hence, it must be an ingredient of Stop and Stare or A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
