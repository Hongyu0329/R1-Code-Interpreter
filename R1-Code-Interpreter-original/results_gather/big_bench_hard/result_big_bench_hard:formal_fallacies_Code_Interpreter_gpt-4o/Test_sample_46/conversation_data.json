    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: No half-sister of Nelda is a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\n2. Premise 2: It is false that Gretchen is a close friend of Terrie.\n3. Premise 3: It is false that Gretchen is a cousin of Amanda.\n4. Conclusion: It is not the case that Gretchen is a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if someone is a half-sister of Nelda, then they cannot be a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\n\nPremise 2 and Premise 3 state that Gretchen is neither a close friend of Terrie nor a cousin of Amanda.\n\nThe conclusion states that Gretchen is not a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n- If Gretchen were a half-sister of Nelda, then she would have to be either a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda (by Premise 1).\n- Since Gretchen is neither a close friend of Terrie (Premise 2) nor a cousin of Amanda (Premise 3), it follows that she cannot be a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nThis reasoning is logically sound and follows the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
