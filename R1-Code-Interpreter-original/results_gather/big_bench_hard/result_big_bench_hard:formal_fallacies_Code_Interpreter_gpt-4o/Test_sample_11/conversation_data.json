    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap is necessary for being an owner of a Lever soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an owner of a Lever soap, then they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n\n2. Premise 2: Being an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is sufficient for being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, then they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n\nConclusion: Every infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is an owner of a Lever soap.\n\nLet's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n- From Premise 1, if someone is a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap, they are an owner of a Lever soap.\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can deduce that if someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap, and therefore, they are an owner of a Lever soap.\n\nThis logical flow shows that the conclusion follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
