    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n**Premise:** Every uncle of Harvey is not an ancestor of Adrian and not a nephew of Ward.\n\n**Conclusion:** No nephew of Ward and no ancestor of Adrian is an uncle of Harvey.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis:**\n   - Every uncle of Harvey is not an ancestor of Adrian.\n   - Every uncle of Harvey is not a nephew of Ward.\n\n2. **Conclusion Analysis:**\n   - No nephew of Ward is an uncle of Harvey.\n   - No ancestor of Adrian is an uncle of Harvey.\n\nThe premise states that if someone is an uncle of Harvey, then they cannot be an ancestor of Adrian and cannot be a nephew of Ward. The conclusion states that if someone is a nephew of Ward or an ancestor of Adrian, then they cannot be an uncle of Harvey.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because:\n- If every uncle of Harvey is not a nephew of Ward, then it follows that no nephew of Ward can be an uncle of Harvey.\n- If every uncle of Harvey is not an ancestor of Adrian, then it follows that no ancestor of Adrian can be an uncle of Harvey.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
