    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: No stepbrother of Bryan is both a nephew of Wilburn and a son of Howard.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is not a son of Howard is a son of Adrian.\n3. Premise 3: Nobody is neither a nephew of Wilburn nor a son of Adrian.\n\nConclusion: Everyone who is a stepbrother of Bryan is a son of Adrian.\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a stepbrother of Bryan, they cannot be both a nephew of Wilburn and a son of Howard.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is not a son of Howard, they must be a son of Adrian.\n- From Premise 3, we know that everyone must be either a nephew of Wilburn or a son of Adrian (or both).\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- The conclusion states that every stepbrother of Bryan is a son of Adrian.\n\nTo check the validity, consider the following:\n\n- If a stepbrother of Bryan were a son of Howard, then by Premise 1, they cannot be a nephew of Wilburn. But by Premise 3, they must be a son of Adrian if they are not a nephew of Wilburn.\n- If a stepbrother of Bryan is not a son of Howard, then by Premise 2, they must be a son of Adrian.\n\nIn both cases, a stepbrother of Bryan ends up being a son of Adrian. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
