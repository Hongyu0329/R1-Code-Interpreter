The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a cousin of Lawrence is sufficient for being a schoolmate of Kenneth. Moreover, somebody is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.

    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Being a cousin of Lawrence is sufficient for being a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This means if someone is a cousin of Lawrence, then they are a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n\n2. Premise 2: Somebody is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is a close friend of Philip but is not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n\nConclusion: Not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that all cousins of Lawrence are schoolmates of Kenneth.\n- From Premise 2, we know there is at least one close friend of Philip who is not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n- If this person is not a schoolmate of Kenneth, then according to Premise 1, they cannot be a cousin of Lawrence.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence logically follows from the premises. The argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
