    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Whoever is a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap is not a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is an owner of a Lush soap and an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is not a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap.\n3. Conclusion: Every owner of a Lush soap who is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is also a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone owns a Lush soap and is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap, they are not a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap, they are not a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\nThe conclusion states that every owner of a Lush soap who is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap. \n\nTo determine if this conclusion follows logically from the premises, consider the following:\n\n- If someone is not a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap (from Premise 2), Premise 1 does not apply to them. Therefore, Premise 1 does not provide any information about whether they are a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\nThe conclusion that they must be a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap does not logically follow from the premises, as the premises do not provide sufficient information to make this determination.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
