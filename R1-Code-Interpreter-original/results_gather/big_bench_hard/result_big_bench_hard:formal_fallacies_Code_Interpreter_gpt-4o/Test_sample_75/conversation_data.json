    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: If something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, then it is either not an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies or not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow (\\neg N \\lor \\neg E) \\)\n\n2. Premise 2: Being an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit is necessary for not being an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg I \\rightarrow E \\)\n\n3. Premise 3: Whatever is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 is an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg I \\rightarrow N \\)\n\nConclusion: Necessarily, nothing is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg (\\neg I \\land \\neg S) \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2 (\\( \\neg I \\rightarrow E \\)) and Premise 3 (\\( \\neg I \\rightarrow N \\)), we can infer that if something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\( \\neg I \\)), it must be both an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit (\\( E \\)) and an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies (\\( N \\)).\n\n- From Premise 1 (\\( \\neg S \\rightarrow (\\neg N \\lor \\neg E) \\)), if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\( \\neg S \\)), it must be either not an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies (\\( \\neg N \\)) or not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit (\\( \\neg E \\)).\n\n- The conclusion (\\( \\neg (\\neg I \\land \\neg S) \\)) states that it is not possible for something to be neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\( \\neg I \\)) nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\( \\neg S \\)).\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the premises logically lead to the conclusion. If something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\( \\neg I \\)), it must be both an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit (\\( E \\)) and an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies (\\( N \\)). This contradicts Premise 1 if it is also not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\( \\neg S \\)), because Premise 1 requires that it be either not an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies (\\( \\neg N \\)) or not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit (\\( \\neg E \\)).\n\nTherefore, the premises logically lead to the conclusion that it is not possible for something to be neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
