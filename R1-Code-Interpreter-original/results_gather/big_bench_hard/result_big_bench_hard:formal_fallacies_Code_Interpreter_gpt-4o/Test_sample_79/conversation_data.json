    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Everyone who is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap is, however, a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Oliver is a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\nLet's break down the second premise:\n\n- The condition for being a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap is not being both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap.\n\nSince Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo (from the first premise), he cannot be both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap. Therefore, according to the second premise, Oliver must be a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer: valid>>>"
