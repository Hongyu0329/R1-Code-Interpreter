    "\nassistant > To determine the deductive validity of the argument, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Whoever is not a cousin of Andres is a workmate of Isaac.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not a cousin of Andres, then a workmate of Isaac.\n\n2. Premise 2: Nobody is neither a grandson of Reyes nor a workmate of Isaac.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not a grandson of Reyes, then a workmate of Isaac.\n\n3. Premise 3: No stepbrother of Phillip is both a grandson of Reyes and a cousin of Andres.\n   - This can be expressed as: If a stepbrother of Phillip, then not both a grandson of Reyes and a cousin of Andres.\n\nConclusion: Being a workmate of Isaac is necessary for being a stepbrother of Phillip.\n   - This can be expressed as: If a stepbrother of Phillip, then a workmate of Isaac.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 3, if someone is a stepbrother of Phillip, they cannot be both a grandson of Reyes and a cousin of Andres.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is not a grandson of Reyes, they must be a workmate of Isaac.\n- Therefore, if a stepbrother of Phillip is not a grandson of Reyes, they must be a workmate of Isaac.\n- From Premise 1, if someone is not a cousin of Andres, they must be a workmate of Isaac.\n- Therefore, if a stepbrother of Phillip is not a cousin of Andres, they must be a workmate of Isaac.\n\nIn both cases (whether they are not a grandson of Reyes or not a cousin of Andres), a stepbrother of Phillip must be a workmate of Isaac. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
