    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Whatever is not an ingredient of Shimmer Veil is an ingredient of Snowcastle.\n   - This can be expressed as: If \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Shimmer Veil, then \\( x \\) is an ingredient of Snowcastle.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Every ingredient of Liquid Eye liner is not an ingredient of Love Boat or not an ingredient of Shimmer Veil.\n   - This can be expressed as: If \\( x \\) is an ingredient of Liquid Eye liner, then \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Love Boat or \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Shimmer Veil.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Being an ingredient of Snowcastle is necessary for not being an ingredient of Love Boat.\n   - This can be expressed as: If \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Love Boat, then \\( x \\) is an ingredient of Snowcastle.\n\n**Conclusion**: Everything that is an ingredient of Liquid Eye liner is an ingredient of Snowcastle.\n\nLet's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the second premise, if \\( x \\) is an ingredient of Liquid Eye liner, then \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Love Boat or \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Shimmer Veil.\n- If \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Shimmer Veil, then by the first premise, \\( x \\) is an ingredient of Snowcastle.\n- If \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Love Boat, then by the third premise, \\( x \\) is an ingredient of Snowcastle.\n\nIn both cases (whether \\( x \\) is not an ingredient of Shimmer Veil or not an ingredient of Love Boat), \\( x \\) ends up being an ingredient of Snowcastle. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
