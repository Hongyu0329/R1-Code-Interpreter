    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an owner of a Lever soap or not being a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n3. **Conclusion**: Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\nLet's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 2, we can express it in logical terms as:\n  - If (Jonathan owns a Lever soap) OR (Jonathan is not a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap), then Jonathan is a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap.\n\n- Therefore, the condition \"Jonathan is not a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap\" is false.\n\n- For Jonathan to be a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo, the other condition \"Jonathan owns a Lever soap\" must be true (since it's an OR condition).\n\n- However, the conclusion states that Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo, which implies that neither condition in the OR statement is true.\n\n- Since we have no information about whether Jonathan owns a Lever soap, we cannot definitively conclude that Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo based solely on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
