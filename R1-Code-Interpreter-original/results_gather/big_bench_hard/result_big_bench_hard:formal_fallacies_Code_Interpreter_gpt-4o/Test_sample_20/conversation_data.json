    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every supporter of Tottenham Hotspur is not an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and not a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n   - This means that if someone supports Tottenham Hotspur, they are neither an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ nor a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n\n2. Premise 2: Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n   - This means that if someone is both a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio and an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ, they must be either a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n3. Conclusion: Everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio is a devotee of FC Zenit.\n   - This means that if someone is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they must be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- Premise 1 tells us that supporters of Tottenham Hotspur are neither experts of Trabzonspor AŞ nor backers of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n- Premise 2 tells us that if someone is both a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio and an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ, they are either a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\nThe conclusion states that if someone is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they must be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\nHowever, the premises do not provide information about what happens if someone is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio. The premises only provide information about those who are both, and those who are supporters of Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
