    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. Premise 1: Everyone who is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal is not a son of Ronald.\n2. Premise 2: It is false that Santo is a son of Ronald.\n3. Conclusion: Santo is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\n\nFor the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. Let's analyze:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal, then they are not a son of Ronald.\n- Premise 2 states that Santo is not a son of Ronald.\n\nGiven that Santo is not a son of Ronald, Premise 1 implies that Santo must be either a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
