    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states:\n- Whoever is a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy is not a great-grandmother of Jaime.\n\nThe conclusion drawn is:\n- Everyone who is not a great-grandmother of Jaime is, however, a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. The premise establishes a specific condition: If someone is both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy, then they cannot be a great-grandmother of Jaime.\n\n2. The conclusion attempts to generalize this by stating that if someone is not a great-grandmother of Jaime, then they must be a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\n\nThe logical structure of the premise is:\n- If (A and B), then not C.\n\nThe conclusion attempts to assert:\n- If not C, then (A and B).\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The premise does not logically support the conclusion because the absence of C (not being a great-grandmother of Jaime) does not necessarily imply the presence of both A (being a great-grandmother of Dawn) and B (being a sister of Nancy).\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
