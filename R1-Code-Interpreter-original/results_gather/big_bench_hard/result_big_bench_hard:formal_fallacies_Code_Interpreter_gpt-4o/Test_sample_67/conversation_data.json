    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Nobody is neither an ancestor of Alvin nor a workmate of Tony.\n   - This means that everyone is either an ancestor of Alvin or a workmate of Tony (or both).\n\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is a schoolmate of Keith is not an ancestor of Alvin.\n   - This means that if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they cannot be an ancestor of Alvin.\n\nConclusion: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Keith is a workmate of Tony, too.\n\nLet's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they are not an ancestor of Alvin.\n- From Premise 1, since they are not an ancestor of Alvin, they must be a workmate of Tony (because everyone is either an ancestor of Alvin or a workmate of Tony).\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
