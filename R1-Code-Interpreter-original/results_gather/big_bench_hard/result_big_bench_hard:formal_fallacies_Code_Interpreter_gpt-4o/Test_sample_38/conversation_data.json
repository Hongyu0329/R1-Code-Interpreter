    "\nassistant > To determine the validity of the argument, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ancestor of Christy is necessary for being a daughter of Denise.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a daughter of Denise, then they are an ancestor of Christy.\n   - In logical terms: \\( D \\rightarrow A \\) (where \\( D \\) is \"being a daughter of Denise\" and \\( A \\) is \"being an ancestor of Christy\").\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Not being a cousin of Maryann is sufficient for not being an ancestor of Christy.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a cousin of Maryann, then they are not an ancestor of Christy.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (where \\( C \\) is \"being a cousin of Maryann\").\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a daughter of Denise is a cousin of Maryann.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow C \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 1 (\\( D \\rightarrow A \\)), we know that if someone is not an ancestor of Christy (\\( \\neg A \\)), then they are not a daughter of Denise (\\( \\neg D \\)).\n\n- From Premise 2 (\\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)), we know that if someone is not a cousin of Maryann (\\( \\neg C \\)), then they are not an ancestor of Christy (\\( \\neg A \\)).\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion (\\( \\neg D \\rightarrow C \\)) logically follows from these premises.\n\n- If someone is not a daughter of Denise (\\( \\neg D \\)), then from Premise 1, they are not an ancestor of Christy (\\( \\neg A \\)).\n- From Premise 2, if someone is not an ancestor of Christy (\\( \\neg A \\)), then they must be a cousin of Maryann (\\( C \\)).\n\nThus, the conclusion (\\( \\neg D \\rightarrow C \\)) logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
