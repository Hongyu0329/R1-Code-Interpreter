    "\nassistant > To determine the deductive validity of the argument, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Whoever is not a rare consumer of Lever soap is an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n2. There exists an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who is not an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap or not an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Some rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. From the first premise, we can infer that if someone is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, they must be an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo. This can be expressed as:\n   - If not (rare consumer of Lever soap), then (infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo).\n\n2. The second premise states that there exists an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who is not an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap or not an occasional purchaser of Zest soap. This can be expressed as:\n   - There exists an x such that (infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo) and (not occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap or not occasional purchaser of Zest soap).\n\n3. The conclusion states that some rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap. This can be expressed as:\n   - There exists a y such that (rare consumer of Lever soap) and (not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap).\n\n**Logical Deduction:**\n\n- From the first premise, if someone is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, they must be an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n- From the second premise, there is an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who does not purchase either Paul Mitchell soap or Zest soap occasionally.\n- The conclusion claims that some rare consumer of Lever soap does not purchase both Paul Mitchell soap and Zest soap occasionally.\n\nThe argument is structured such that the premises do not logically lead to the conclusion. The premises do not provide sufficient information to deduce the conclusion about rare consumers of Lever soap. The existence of an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who does not purchase either Paul Mitchell or Zest soap does not imply anything about rare consumers of Lever soap.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
