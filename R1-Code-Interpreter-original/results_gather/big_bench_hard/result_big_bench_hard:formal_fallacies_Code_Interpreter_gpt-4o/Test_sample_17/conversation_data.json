    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. First premise: Everyone who is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is a follower of FK Kukësi.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they are a follower of FK Kukësi.\n\n2. Second premise: No follower of FK Kukësi is a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a follower of FK Kukësi, then they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\nConclusion: Whoever is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\nThe argument follows a logical structure known as a syllogism:\n\n- If A (devotee of Legia Warszawa) then B (follower of FK Kukësi).\n- If B (follower of FK Kukësi) then not C (not a friend of Olympique de Marseille).\n- Therefore, if A (devotee of Legia Warszawa) then not C (not a friend of Olympique de Marseille).\n\nThis is a classic example of a valid deductive argument known as a hypothetical syllogism. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
