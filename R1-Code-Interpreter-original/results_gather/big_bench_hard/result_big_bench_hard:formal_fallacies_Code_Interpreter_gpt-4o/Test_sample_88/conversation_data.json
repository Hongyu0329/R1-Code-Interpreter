    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some classmate of Sherry is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a schoolmate of Leonor is sufficient for being a half-sister of Peggy.\n3. **Premise 3**: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Leonor is a great-grandmother of Sophie, too.\n\n**Conclusion**: There is somebody who is a classmate of Sherry and not a schoolmate of Leonor.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, then they are a half-sister of Peggy.\n- From Premise 3, if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, then they are also a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n- Therefore, if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, they must be both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n\nNow, consider Premise 1:\n\n- It states that some classmate of Sherry is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie. This implies that there is at least one classmate of Sherry who does not satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nGiven that being a schoolmate of Leonor implies being both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie, the only way for Premise 1 to hold true is if there is a classmate of Sherry who is not a schoolmate of Leonor. \n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
