    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne is an ancestor of Leslie.\n3. **Conclusion**: It follows that it is false that Darwin is an ancestor of Leslie.\n\nLet's analyze the argument:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne, then they are an ancestor of Leslie.\n- Since Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne, for him to be an ancestor of Leslie, he must not be a half-brother of Alvin.\n- The conclusion states that it is false that Darwin is an ancestor of Leslie, which implies that Darwin must be both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne.\n\nThe argument is structured such that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne and not an ancestor of Leslie, then he must be a half-brother of Alvin, satisfying the condition in Premise 2.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
