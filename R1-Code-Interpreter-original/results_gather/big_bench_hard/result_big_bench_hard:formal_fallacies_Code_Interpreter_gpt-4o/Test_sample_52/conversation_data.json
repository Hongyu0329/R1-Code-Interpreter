    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe given premise is:\n1. Whoever is an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo is not a regular user of Ivory soap.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Being a regular user of Ivory soap is sufficient for not being an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo.\n\nLet's break down the logical structure:\n\n1. The premise can be rewritten in logical terms as: If someone is an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo, then they are not a regular user of Ivory soap. This can be expressed as:\n   - If P (occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo), then not Q (not a regular user of Ivory soap).\n\n2. The conclusion states that being a regular user of Ivory soap is sufficient for not being an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n   - If Q (regular user of Ivory soap), then not P (not an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo).\n\nThe conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
