    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise:** Not being a close friend of Williams is sufficient for not being a nephew of Rolando.\n\n   This can be expressed as: \n   \\[\n   \\neg F \\rightarrow \\neg N\n   \\]\n   where \\( F \\) is \"being a close friend of Williams\" and \\( N \\) is \"being a nephew of Rolando.\"\n\n2. **Conclusion:** Every nephew of Rolando is a close friend of Williams.\n\n   This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   N \\rightarrow F\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise states that if someone is not a close friend of Williams (\\(\\neg F\\)), then they are not a nephew of Rolando (\\(\\neg N\\)).\n- The conclusion states that if someone is a nephew of Rolando (\\(N\\)), then they are a close friend of Williams (\\(F\\)).\n\nThe conclusion \\(N \\rightarrow F\\) is the contrapositive of the premise \\(\\neg F \\rightarrow \\neg N\\). In logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid<<<answer>>>"
