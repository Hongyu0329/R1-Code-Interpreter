    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. Premise 1: Being an ex-fan of Villarreal CF is necessary for being a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, then they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n\n2. Premise 2: Some supporter of Östersunds FK is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who supports Östersunds FK and is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n\nConclusion: Somebody is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nTo check the validity, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n- From Premise 2, there is a supporter of Östersunds FK who is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion logically follows because if someone is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF (as stated in Premise 2), they cannot be a member of SK Rapid Wien (as required by Premise 1). Therefore, the person who is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF cannot be a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
