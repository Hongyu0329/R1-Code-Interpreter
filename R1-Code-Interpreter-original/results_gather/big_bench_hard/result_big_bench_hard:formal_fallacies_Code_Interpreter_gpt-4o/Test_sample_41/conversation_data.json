    "\nassistant > To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. Premise 1: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Mildred is a daughter of Jeanette.\n2. Premise 2: Being a daughter of Jeanette is sufficient for not being a cousin of Cristi.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, no schoolmate of Mildred is a cousin of Cristi.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, then they are a daughter of Jeanette.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a daughter of Jeanette, then they are not a cousin of Cristi.\n\nUsing these premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n- If someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, then they are a daughter of Jeanette (Premise 1).\n- If they are a daughter of Jeanette, then they are not a cousin of Cristi (Premise 2).\n\nTherefore, if someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, they cannot be a cousin of Cristi. This directly supports the conclusion.\n\nThe argument follows a valid logical structure known as a hypothetical syllogism:\n\n- If A, then B.\n- If B, then C.\n- Therefore, if A, then C.\n\nIn this case:\n- A = being a schoolmate of Mildred\n- B = being a daughter of Jeanette\n- C = not being a cousin of Cristi\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
