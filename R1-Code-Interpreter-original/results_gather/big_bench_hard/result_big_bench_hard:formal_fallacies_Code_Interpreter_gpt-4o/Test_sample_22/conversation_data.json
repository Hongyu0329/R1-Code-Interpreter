    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some uncle of Dominic is a schoolmate of Earl.\n2. **Premise 2**: Everyone who is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey is not a schoolmate of Earl.\n3. **Conclusion**: Some uncle of Dominic is not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know there exists at least one uncle of Dominic who is a schoolmate of Earl.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey, then they cannot be a schoolmate of Earl.\n\nTo satisfy both premises, the uncle of Dominic who is a schoolmate of Earl cannot be both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey. Therefore, this uncle must be either not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey (or both).\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, as it states that some uncle of Dominic is not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey, which is consistent with the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
