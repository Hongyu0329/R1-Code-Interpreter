    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a friend of Kilmarnock FC is sufficient for not being an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a friend of Kilmarnock FC, then they are not an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - In logical terms: \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (where \\( F \\) is \"friend of Kilmarnock FC\" and \\( A \\) is \"admirer of The New Saints FC\").\n\n2. **Second Premise**: It is false that Maximo is an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: We may conclude that it is false that Maximo is a friend of Kilmarnock FC.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg F \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise, we have \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n- From the second premise, we have \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nThe conclusion \\( \\neg F \\) does not logically follow from the premises. The premises do not provide information about what happens if someone is not an admirer of The New Saints FC. The premises only state that being a friend of Kilmarnock FC is sufficient for not being an admirer of The New Saints FC, but they do not state that not being an admirer of The New Saints FC implies not being a friend of Kilmarnock FC.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
