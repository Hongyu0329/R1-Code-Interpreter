    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states:\n1. Every fan of FC Lugano is neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n\nThe conclusion states:\n2. Whoever is none of this: a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva or ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, is a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- The premise tells us that if someone is a fan of FC Lugano, then they are not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n- The conclusion claims that if someone is not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, then they are a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nThe logical structure of the premise is:\n- If A (fan of FC Lugano), then not B (devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva) and not C (ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem).\n\nThe logical structure of the conclusion is:\n- If not B and not C, then A.\n\nThis is a classic example of affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because all fans of FC Lugano are neither devotees of PFC CSKA Moskva nor ex-supporters of SV Zulte Waregem, it does not logically follow that everyone who is neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem is a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
