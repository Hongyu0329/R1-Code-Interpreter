    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Every opponent to AS Roma is a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin or a fan of AC Sparta Praha or not a fan of FCSB.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an opponent to AS Roma, then they are either a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, a fan of AC Sparta Praha, or not a fan of FCSB.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: No fan of FCSB is an expert of FK Sūduva.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a fan of FCSB, then they are not an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Every fan of AC Sparta Praha is an expert of FK Sūduva.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a fan of AC Sparta Praha, then they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n4. **Fourth Premise**: Being an expert of FK Sūduva is necessary for being a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, then they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n**Conclusion**: Being an expert of FK Sūduva is necessary for being an opponent to AS Roma.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an opponent to AS Roma, then they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, an opponent to AS Roma must be either a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, a fan of AC Sparta Praha, or not a fan of FCSB.\n- From the second premise, if they are a fan of FCSB, they cannot be an expert of FK Sūduva.\n- From the third premise, if they are a fan of AC Sparta Praha, they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n- From the fourth premise, if they are a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\nThus, for someone to be an opponent to AS Roma, they must either be a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin or a fan of AC Sparta Praha, both of which require them to be an expert of FK Sūduva. If they are not a fan of FCSB, it does not affect their status as an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
