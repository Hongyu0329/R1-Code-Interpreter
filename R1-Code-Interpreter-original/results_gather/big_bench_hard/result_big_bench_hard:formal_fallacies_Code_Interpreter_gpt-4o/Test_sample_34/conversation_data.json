    "\nassistant > To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. If someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, then that person is not a backer of FC Augsburg or not a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n   - This can be written as: If not Feyenoord, then (not FC Augsburg or not AS Monaco FC).\n\n2. Being a devotee of AS Monaco FC is necessary for not being a member of AC Milan.\n   - This can be written as: If not AC Milan, then AS Monaco FC.\n\n3. Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a backer of FC Augsburg.\n   - This can be written as: Everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a backer of FC Augsburg.\n\nConclusion:\n- Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a follower of Feyenoord.\n  - This can be written as: Everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a follower of Feyenoord.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From premise 3, we know that everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a backer of FC Augsburg.\n- From premise 2, if someone is not a member of AC Milan, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n- From premise 1, if someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, they must be either a backer of FC Augsburg or a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows:\n\n- If someone is not a member of AC Milan, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC (from premise 2).\n- If they are a devotee of AS Monaco FC, they cannot be a member of AC Milan (from premise 2).\n- If they are not a follower of Feyenoord, they must be either a backer of FC Augsburg or a devotee of AS Monaco FC (from premise 1).\n- From premise 3, everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a backer of FC Augsburg.\n\nTherefore, if someone is not a member of AC Milan, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC, and if they are not a follower of Feyenoord, they must be a backer of FC Augsburg. This means that everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a follower of Feyenoord, which matches the conclusion.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer:valid>>>"
