    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the sequence of points and lines described by the path data.\n\nThe path data is as follows:\n- M 59.64,77.72: Move to the starting point (59.64, 77.72).\n- L 75.18,56.50: Draw a line to (75.18, 56.50).\n- L 6.90,59.13: Draw a line to (6.90, 59.13).\n- L 22.09,77.44: Draw a line to (22.09, 77.44).\n- L 2.73,94.57: Draw a line to (2.73, 94.57).\n- L 91.78,91.66: Draw a line to (91.78, 91.66).\n- L 59.64,77.72: Draw a line back to the starting point (59.64, 77.72).\n\nThe path consists of six line segments that connect six points, forming a closed shape. This indicates that the shape is a hexagon, as a hexagon is a polygon with six sides.\n\nTherefore, the shape drawn by the SVG path element is a hexagon.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) hexagon"
