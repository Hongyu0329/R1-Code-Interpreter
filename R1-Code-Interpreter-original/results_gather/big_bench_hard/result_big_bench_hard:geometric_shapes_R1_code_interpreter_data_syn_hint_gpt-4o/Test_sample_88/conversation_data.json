    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the `d` attribute. The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates that describe the shape.\n\nThe path data is: `M 22.37,37.09 L 19.67,23.62 L 28.47,31.97 L 28.41,25.18 M 28.41,25.18 L 36.86,18.98 L 37.15,26.75 L 35.72,33.89 L 27.91,38.38 M 27.91,38.38 L 22.37,37.09`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `M 22.37,37.09`: Move to the starting point (22.37, 37.09).\n2. `L 19.67,23.62`: Draw a line to (19.67, 23.62).\n3. `L 28.47,31.97`: Draw a line to (28.47, 31.97).\n4. `L 28.41,25.18`: Draw a line to (28.41, 25.18).\n5. `M 28.41,25.18`: Move to (28.41, 25.18) without drawing a line.\n6. `L 36.86,18.98`: Draw a line to (36.86, 18.98).\n7. `L 37.15,26.75`: Draw a line to (37.15, 26.75).\n8. `L 35.72,33.89`: Draw a line to (35.72, 33.89).\n9. `L 27.91,38.38`: Draw a line to (27.91, 38.38).\n10. `M 27.91,38.38`: Move to (27.91, 38.38) without drawing a line.\n11. `L 22.37,37.09`: Draw a line back to the starting point (22.37, 37.09).\n\nThe path consists of two separate sub-paths, each forming a closed shape. The first sub-path is a triangle formed by the points (22.37, 37.09), (19.67, 23.62), and (28.47, 31.97). The second sub-path is a quadrilateral formed by the points (28.41, 25.18), (36.86, 18.98), (37.15, 26.75), and (35.72, 33.89), and it closes back to (27.91, 38.38).\n\nSince the path consists of two separate shapes, it does not form a single geometric shape like a circle, hexagon, or rectangle. The presence of a triangle in the path suggests that the correct answer is a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a triangle.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
