    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the `d` attribute. The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates that describe the shape.\n\nThe path data is: `M 49.47,26.27 L 55.28,65.93 L 48.51,77.47 M 48.51,77.47 L 34.78,81.76 L 36.76,67.00 M 36.76,67.00 L 14.38,76.83 M 14.38,76.83 L 49.47,26.27`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `M 49.47,26.27`: Move to the starting point (49.47, 26.27).\n2. `L 55.28,65.93`: Draw a line to (55.28, 65.93).\n3. `L 48.51,77.47`: Draw a line to (48.51, 77.47).\n4. `M 48.51,77.47`: Move to (48.51, 77.47) again (this is redundant as we are already at this point).\n5. `L 34.78,81.76`: Draw a line to (34.78, 81.76).\n6. `L 36.76,67.00`: Draw a line to (36.76, 67.00).\n7. `M 36.76,67.00`: Move to (36.76, 67.00) again (this is redundant as we are already at this point).\n8. `L 14.38,76.83`: Draw a line to (14.38, 76.83).\n9. `M 14.38,76.83`: Move to (14.38, 76.83) again (this is redundant as we are already at this point).\n10. `L 49.47,26.27`: Draw a line back to the starting point (49.47, 26.27).\n\nThe path consists of a series of lines that form a closed shape. To identify the shape, we need to count the number of distinct points and lines.\n\n- The distinct points are: (49.47, 26.27), (55.28, 65.93), (48.51, 77.47), (34.78, 81.76), (36.76, 67.00), (14.38, 76.83).\n- There are 6 distinct points, and the lines connect these points in a closed loop.\n\nA shape with 6 sides is a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a hexagon.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
