    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the `d` attribute. The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates that describe the shape.\n\nThe path data is: `M 82.48,71.72 L 86.86,76.47 L 74.69,38.07 M 74.69,38.07 L 46.36,43.46 L 40.46,60.21 L 76.97,78.68 L 82.48,71.72`\n\nLet's break down the commands:\n- `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path.\n- `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\nThe path can be broken down into two segments:\n1. `M 82.48,71.72 L 86.86,76.47 L 74.69,38.07` - This segment starts at (82.48, 71.72), draws a line to (86.86, 76.47), and then to (74.69, 38.07).\n2. `M 74.69,38.07 L 46.36,43.46 L 40.46,60.21 L 76.97,78.68 L 82.48,71.72` - This segment starts at (74.69, 38.07), draws lines to (46.36, 43.46), (40.46, 60.21), (76.97, 78.68), and finally back to (82.48, 71.72).\n\nThe second segment forms a closed shape with five points: (74.69, 38.07), (46.36, 43.46), (40.46, 60.21), (76.97, 78.68), and (82.48, 71.72). This is a pentagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a pentagon.\n\n<<<G) pentagon>>>"
