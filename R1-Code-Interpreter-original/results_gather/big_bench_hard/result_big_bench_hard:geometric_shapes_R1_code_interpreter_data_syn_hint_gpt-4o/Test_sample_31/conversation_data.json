    "To determine what shape the SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the SVG element. The path data is given as:\n\n`M 83.17,32.03 L 87.90,19.01 L 76.80,8.19 L 69.67,12.38 L 72.92,22.11 M 72.92,22.11 L 83.17,32.03`\n\nLet's break down the path data:\n\n1. `M 83.17,32.03`: This command moves the pen to the starting point (83.17, 32.03).\n2. `L 87.90,19.01`: This draws a line from the current point to (87.90, 19.01).\n3. `L 76.80,8.19`: This draws a line from the current point to (76.80, 8.19).\n4. `L 69.67,12.38`: This draws a line from the current point to (69.67, 12.38).\n5. `L 72.92,22.11`: This draws a line from the current point to (72.92, 22.11).\n6. `M 72.92,22.11`: This moves the pen to (72.92, 22.11) without drawing a line.\n7. `L 83.17,32.03`: This draws a line from the current point to (83.17, 32.03).\n\nThe path consists of a series of line segments that form a closed shape. The points are connected in the following order:\n\n- (83.17, 32.03) to (87.90, 19.01)\n- (87.90, 19.01) to (76.80, 8.19)\n- (76.80, 8.19) to (69.67, 12.38)\n- (69.67, 12.38) to (72.92, 22.11)\n- (72.92, 22.11) to (83.17, 32.03)\n\nThis forms a closed shape with five sides, which is a pentagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a pentagon.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
