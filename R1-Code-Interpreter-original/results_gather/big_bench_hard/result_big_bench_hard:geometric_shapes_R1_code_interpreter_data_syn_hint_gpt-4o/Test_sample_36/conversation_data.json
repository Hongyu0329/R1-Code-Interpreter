    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data provided in the `d` attribute. The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates that describe the shape.\n\nThe path data is: `M 27.90,64.74 L 34.84,44.47 L 47.96,46.51 L 42.27,35.46 L 66.92,43.08 M 66.92,43.08 L 55.91,49.64 M 55.91,49.64 L 56.62,66.11 L 27.90,64.74`\n\nLet's break down the path data:\n\n1. `M 27.90,64.74`: Move to the starting point (27.90, 64.74).\n2. `L 34.84,44.47`: Draw a line to (34.84, 44.47).\n3. `L 47.96,46.51`: Draw a line to (47.96, 46.51).\n4. `L 42.27,35.46`: Draw a line to (42.27, 35.46).\n5. `L 66.92,43.08`: Draw a line to (66.92, 43.08).\n6. `M 66.92,43.08`: Move to (66.92, 43.08) again.\n7. `L 55.91,49.64`: Draw a line to (55.91, 49.64).\n8. `M 55.91,49.64`: Move to (55.91, 49.64) again.\n9. `L 56.62,66.11`: Draw a line to (56.62, 66.11).\n10. `L 27.90,64.74`: Draw a line back to the starting point (27.90, 64.74).\n\nThe path consists of a series of lines that form a closed shape. To identify the shape, we need to count the number of distinct points and the lines connecting them.\n\nLet's analyze the points and lines:\n\n- Points: (27.90, 64.74), (34.84, 44.47), (47.96, 46.51), (42.27, 35.46), (66.92, 43.08), (55.91, 49.64), (56.62, 66.11)\n- Lines: There are 7 lines connecting these points.\n\nThe shape formed by these points and lines is a heptagon, which is a polygon with seven sides.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a heptagon.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) heptagon"
