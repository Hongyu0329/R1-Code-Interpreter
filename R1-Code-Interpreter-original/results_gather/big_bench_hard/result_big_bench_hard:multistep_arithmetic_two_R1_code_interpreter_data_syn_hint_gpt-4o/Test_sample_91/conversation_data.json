    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 - -4 * 2 - 9) * (9 - 6 - 1 + -4))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses**:\n   - Inside the first set of parentheses: \\(-7 - (-4) \\times 2 - 9\\)\n     - First, calculate \\(-4 \\times 2 = -8\\).\n     - Then, substitute back: \\(-7 - (-8) - 9\\).\n     - Simplify: \\(-7 + 8 - 9\\).\n     - Calculate: \\(1 - 9 = -8\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**:\n   - Inside the second set of parentheses: \\(9 - 6 - 1 + (-4)\\)\n     - Calculate: \\(9 - 6 = 3\\).\n     - Then: \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n     - Finally: \\(2 + (-4) = -2\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\((-8) \\times (-2) = 16\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -7 - (-4) * 2 - 9\nsecond_part = 9 - 6 - 1 + (-4)\nresult = first_part * second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result confirms the manual calculation of the expression \\(((-7 - -4 * 2 - 9) * (9 - 6 - 1 + -4))\\). The result is indeed 16.\n\nSince the code execution and manual calculation both agree, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
