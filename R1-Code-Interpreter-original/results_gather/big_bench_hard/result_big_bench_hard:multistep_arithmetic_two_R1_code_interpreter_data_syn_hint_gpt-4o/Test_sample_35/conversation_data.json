    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 + -7 + -2 - 7) * (6 - 1 - -1 * 5))\\), we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression:**\n   \\(-1 + -7 + -2 - 7\\)\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression:**\n   \\(6 - 1 - -1 * 5\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two simplified parts.**\n\nLet's calculate each part:\n\n1. **First part:**\n   \\(-1 + -7 + -2 - 7 = -1 - 7 - 2 - 7\\)\n   \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\)\n   \\(-8 - 2 = -10\\)\n   \\(-10 - 7 = -17\\)\n\n2. **Second part:**\n   \\(6 - 1 - -1 * 5\\)\n   \\(-1 * 5 = -5\\)\n   \\(6 - 1 + 5\\)\n   \\(6 - 1 = 5\\)\n   \\(5 + 5 = 10\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results:**\n   \\(-17 * 10 = -170\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -1 + -7 + -2 - 7\nsecond_part = 6 - 1 - (-1 * 5)\nresult = first_part * second_part\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-170>>>",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculation was performed correctly, and the result of the expression \\(((-1 + -7 + -2 - 7) * (6 - 1 - -1 * 5))\\) is indeed \\(-170\\).\n\nSince the code execution result matches the expected outcome, there is no need for further symbolic computing or complex code generation in this case. The problem was straightforward and did not require advanced techniques.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-170>>>"
