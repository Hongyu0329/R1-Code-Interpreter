    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + -6 \\times 9 - 7) + (8 + 2 \\times -9 \\times -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the first set of parentheses**: \\((-8 + -6 \\times 9 - 7)\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-6 \\times 9 = -54\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-8 + (-54) - 7\\)\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \n     - \\(-8 + (-54) = -62\\)\n     - \\(-62 - 7 = -69\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**: \\((8 + 2 \\times -9 \\times -7)\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \n     - \\(-9 \\times -7 = 63\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 63 = 126\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(8 + 126\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(8 + 126 = 134\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parentheses**: \n   - \\((-69) + 134\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-69 + 134 = 65\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -8 + (-6 * 9) - 7\nsecond_part = 8 + (2 * -9 * -7)\nresult = first_part + second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is correct. The expression \\(((-8 + -6 \\times 9 - 7) + (8 + 2 \\times -9 \\times -7))\\) evaluates to 65.\n\nSince the code execution matches the manual calculation, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 65"
