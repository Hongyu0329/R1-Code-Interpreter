    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4) \\times (-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses**:\n   - Inside the first set of parentheses: \\(-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(6 \\times -2 = -12\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(-8 + (-12) + 4 = -16\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**:\n   - Inside the second set of parentheses: \\(-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-4 \\times 5 = -20\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(-20 + 2 - 8 = -26\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated parentheses**:\n   - \\((-16) \\times (-26)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the final multiplication using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = (-16) * (-26)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution result of 416 is correct for the multiplication of \\((-16) \\times (-26)\\). This confirms that the calculations were performed accurately according to the order of operations.\n\nTo summarize the steps:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\(-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4 = -16\\).\n2. Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\(-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8 = -26\\).\n3. Multiply the results of the two evaluated expressions: \\((-16) \\times (-26) = 416\\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression \\(((-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4) \\times (-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8))\\) is 416.\n\n<<<answer>>>416<<<answer>>>"
