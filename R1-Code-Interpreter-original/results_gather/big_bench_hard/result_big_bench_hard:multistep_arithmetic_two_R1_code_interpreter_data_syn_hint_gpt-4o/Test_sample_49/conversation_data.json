    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 \\times 9 - -9 + 7) + (9 \\times -6 \\times -4 \\times -6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part inside the parentheses**: \\((-7 \\times 9 - -9 + 7)\\)\n   - Calculate \\(-7 \\times 9 = -63\\)\n   - The expression becomes \\((-63 - -9 + 7)\\)\n   - Simplify \\(-63 - -9\\) to \\(-63 + 9 = -54\\)\n   - Add 7: \\(-54 + 7 = -47\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part inside the parentheses**: \\((9 \\times -6 \\times -4 \\times -6)\\)\n   - Calculate \\(9 \\times -6 = -54\\)\n   - Then \\(-54 \\times -4 = 216\\)\n   - Finally, \\(216 \\times -6 = -1296\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parts**:\n   - Add the results: \\(-47 + (-1296) = -1343\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-7 * 9 - -9 + 7)\npart2 = (9 * -6 * -4 * -6)\nresult = part1 + part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms the calculation of the expression \\(((-7 \\times 9 - -9 + 7) + (9 \\times -6 \\times -4 \\times -6))\\) as \\(-1343\\). The steps followed in the reasoning process were correct, and the code verified the result accurately.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'-1343'>>>"
