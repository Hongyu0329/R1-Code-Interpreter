    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 + 6 + -6 * -1) + (-5 + -5 + 9 + -2))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**: \n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\((-5 + 6 + -6 * -1)\\).\n   - According to PEMDAS, we first perform the multiplication: \\(-6 * -1 = 6\\).\n   - Now, the expression becomes \\((-5 + 6 + 6)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \n     - \\(-5 + 6 = 1\\)\n     - \\(1 + 6 = 7\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**: \n   - The expression is \\((-5 + -5 + 9 + -2)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-5 + -5 = -10\\)\n     - \\(-10 + 9 = -1\\)\n     - \\(-1 + -2 = -3\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results from both sets of parentheses**:\n   - Now, we have \\(7 + (-3)\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(7 - 3 = 4\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 4.\n\n<<<answer>>>4"
