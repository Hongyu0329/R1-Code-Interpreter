    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 - -3 * 1 - -3) * (-9 - 5 - -2 * -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(-9 - -3 * 1 - -3\\)\n     - \\(-3 * 1 = -3\\)\n     - \\(-9 - (-3) = -9 + 3 = -6\\)\n     - \\(-6 - (-3) = -6 + 3 = -3\\)\n\n   - The second part: \\(-9 - 5 - -2 * -7\\)\n     - \\(-2 * -7 = 14\\)\n     - \\(-9 - 5 = -14\\)\n     - \\(-14 - 14 = -28\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the simplified expressions**:\n   - \\((-3) * (-28) = 84\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -9 - (-3) * 1 - (-3)\nsecond_part = -9 - 5 - (-2) * (-7)\nresult = first_part * second_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is indeed 84. The step-by-step breakdown and the code both lead to the same result, ensuring the accuracy of the solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((-9 - -3 * 1 - -3) * (-9 - 5 - -2 * -7))\\) is:\n\n<<<'84'>>>"
