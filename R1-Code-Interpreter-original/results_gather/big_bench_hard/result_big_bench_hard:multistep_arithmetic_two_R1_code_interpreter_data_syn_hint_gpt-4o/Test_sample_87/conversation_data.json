    "To solve the expression \\(((-3 \\times 6 - 0 \\times 6) - (-6 \\times -6 \\times 7 + -8))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Calculate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part inside the parentheses is \\((-3 \\times 6 - 0 \\times 6)\\).\n     - \\(-3 \\times 6 = -18\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 6 = 0\\)\n     - So, \\(-18 - 0 = -18\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the second part inside the parentheses**:\n   - The second part is \\((-6 \\times -6 \\times 7 + -8)\\).\n     - \\(-6 \\times -6 = 36\\)\n     - \\(36 \\times 7 = 252\\)\n     - So, \\(252 + (-8) = 252 - 8 = 244\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parts**:\n   - Now, we subtract the second result from the first: \\(-18 - 244\\).\n\nLet's calculate this final subtraction using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (-3 * 6 - 0 * 6)\npart2 = (-6 * -6 * 7 + -8)\nresult = part1 - part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result of \\(-262\\) indicates that the calculation was performed correctly. Let's break down the steps again to ensure everything is clear:\n\n1. **First Part Calculation**:\n   - \\((-3 \\times 6 - 0 \\times 6)\\) simplifies to:\n     - \\(-3 \\times 6 = -18\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 6 = 0\\)\n     - Therefore, \\(-18 - 0 = -18\\).\n\n2. **Second Part Calculation**:\n   - \\((-6 \\times -6 \\times 7 + -8)\\) simplifies to:\n     - \\(-6 \\times -6 = 36\\)\n     - \\(36 \\times 7 = 252\\)\n     - Adding \\(-8\\) gives \\(252 - 8 = 244\\).\n\n3. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Subtract the second part from the first part: \\(-18 - 244 = -262\\).\n\nThe calculation is consistent with the code execution result. Therefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<answer>>> -262"
