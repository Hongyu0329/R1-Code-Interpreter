    "To solve the expression \\((5 + 6 \\times 4 \\times 9) + (-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\(5 + 6 \\times 4 \\times 9\\).\n   - The expression inside the second set of parentheses is \\(-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Perform multiplication inside the parentheses.\n   - For \\(5 + 6 \\times 4 \\times 9\\):\n     - \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\)\n     - \\(24 \\times 9 = 216\\)\n     - So, \\(5 + 216 = 221\\).\n\n   - For \\(-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1\\):\n     - \\(0 \\times 3 = 0\\)\n     - So, \\(-9 - 0 - 1 = -10\\).\n\n3. **Addition**: Add the results from the evaluated parentheses.\n   - \\(221 + (-10) = 211\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (5 + 6 * 4 * 9) + (-9 - 0 * 3 - 1)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression \\((5 + 6 \\times 4 \\times 9) + (-9 - 0 \\times 3 - 1)\\) is indeed 211. The code correctly followed the order of operations to arrive at this result.\n\nSince the code execution matches the manual calculation, we can confidently conclude that the final answer is correct.\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 211"
