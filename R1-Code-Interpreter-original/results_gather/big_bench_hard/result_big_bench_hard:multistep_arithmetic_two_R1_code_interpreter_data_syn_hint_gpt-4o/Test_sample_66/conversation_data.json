    "To solve the expression \\((4 + 5 \\times -9 \\times -8) - (-9 + -7 - -6 - -9)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(5 \\times -9 = -45\\)\n   - \\(-45 \\times -8 = 360\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses**:\n   - \\(4 + 360 = 364\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses**:\n   - \\(-9 + -7 = -16\\)\n   - \\(-16 - -6 = -16 + 6 = -10\\)\n   - \\(-10 - -9 = -10 + 9 = -1\\)\n\n4. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\(364 - (-1) = 364 + 1 = 365\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = (4 + 5 * -9 * -8) - (-9 + -7 - -6 - -9)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is correct. The expression \\((4 + 5 \\times -9 \\times -8) - (-9 + -7 - -6 - -9)\\) evaluates to 365.\n\nSince the code execution matches the manual calculation, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'365'>>>"
