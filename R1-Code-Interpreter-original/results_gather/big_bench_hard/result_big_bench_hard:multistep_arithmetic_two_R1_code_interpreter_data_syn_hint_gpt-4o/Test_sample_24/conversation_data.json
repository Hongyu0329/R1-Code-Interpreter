    "To solve the expression \\(((5 \\times -8 - -5 \\times -9) \\times (2 - -7 \\times 6 - 4))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(5 \\times -8 - -5 \\times -9\\)\n     - Calculate \\(5 \\times -8 = -40\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-5 \\times -9 = 45\\)\n     - Subtract the results: \\(-40 - 45 = -85\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(2 - -7 \\times 6 - 4\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-7 \\times 6 = -42\\)\n     - Substitute into the expression: \\(2 - (-42) - 4\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(2 + 42 - 4 = 40\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - \\((-85) \\times 40\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the final multiplication using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = (-85) * 40\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final answer.",
    "The code execution result of \\((-85) \\times 40\\) is \\(-3400\\), which matches our manual calculation. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((5 \\times -8 - -5 \\times -9) \\times (2 - -7 \\times 6 - 4))\\) is:\n\n<<<'-3400'>>>"
