    "To solve the expression \\((8 - 2 + -2 \\times 6) \\times (8 + -6 + -8 + -1)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(8 - 2 + -2 \\times 6\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-2 \\times 6 = -12\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(8 - 2 - 12\\)\n     - \\(8 - 2 = 6\\)\n     - \\(6 - 12 = -6\\)\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(8 + -6 + -8 + -1\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(8 - 6 = 2\\)\n     - \\(2 - 8 = -6\\)\n     - \\(-6 - 1 = -7\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\((-6) \\times (-7)\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the final multiplication:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = (-6) * (-7)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the calculation was performed accurately. The expression \\((8 - 2 + -2 \\times 6) \\times (8 + -6 + -8 + -1)\\) simplifies to:\n\n1. The first set of parentheses evaluates to \\(-6\\).\n2. The second set of parentheses evaluates to \\(-7\\).\n3. Multiplying these results: \\((-6) \\times (-7) = 42\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
