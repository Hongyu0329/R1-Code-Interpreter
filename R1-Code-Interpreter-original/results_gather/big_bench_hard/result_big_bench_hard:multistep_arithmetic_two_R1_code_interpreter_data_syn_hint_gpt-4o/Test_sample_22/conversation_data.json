    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 8 - -7 * -2) - (-9 - 5 + 7 + 1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(-6 - 8 - -7 * -2\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-7 * -2\\) which equals \\(14\\).\n     - Substitute back: \\(-6 - 8 - 14\\).\n     - Perform the operations from left to right: \n       - \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\)\n       - \\(-14 - 14 = -28\\)\n\n   - The second part: \\(-9 - 5 + 7 + 1\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right:\n       - \\(-9 - 5 = -14\\)\n       - \\(-14 + 7 = -7\\)\n       - \\(-7 + 1 = -6\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\((-28) - (-6)\\)\n   - This simplifies to \\(-28 + 6\\) because subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive.\n   - \\(-28 + 6 = -22\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -6 - 8 - (-7 * -2)\npart2 = -9 - 5 + 7 + 1\nresult = part1 - part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms our manual calculation. The expression \\(((-6 - 8 - -7 * -2) - (-9 - 5 + 7 + 1))\\) evaluates to \\(-22\\).\n\nSince the code output matches our expected result, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>> -22 <<<answer>>>"
