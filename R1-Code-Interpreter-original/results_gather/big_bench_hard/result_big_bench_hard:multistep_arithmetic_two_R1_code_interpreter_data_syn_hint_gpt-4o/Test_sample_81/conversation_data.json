    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + -4 \\times -9 \\times 0) + (2 \\times -9 + 3 \\times -3))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part is \\(-8 + (-4 \\times -9 \\times 0)\\).\n     - Calculate \\(-4 \\times -9 \\times 0\\). Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, this part becomes 0.\n     - So, \\(-8 + 0 = -8\\).\n\n   - The second part is \\((2 \\times -9 + 3 \\times -3)\\).\n     - Calculate \\(2 \\times -9 = -18\\).\n     - Calculate \\(3 \\times -3 = -9\\).\n     - Add the results: \\(-18 + -9 = -27\\).\n\n2. **Combine the results from both parts**:\n   - \\(-8 + (-27) = -35\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -8 + (-4 * -9 * 0)\npart2 = (2 * -9 + 3 * -3)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is \\(-35\\). The code correctly followed the order of operations and computed the expression step by step. \n\nSince the code execution result matches the expected outcome, we can confidently conclude that the final answer is correct.\n\n<<<answer>>> -35 <<<answer>>>"
