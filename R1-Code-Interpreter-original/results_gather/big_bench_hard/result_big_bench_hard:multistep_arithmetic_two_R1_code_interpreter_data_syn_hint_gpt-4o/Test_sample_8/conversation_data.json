    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 \\times -9 + 8 \\times -3) \\times (5 + -7 - 4 \\times -5))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\((-7 \\times -9 + 8 \\times -3)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-7 \\times -9\\)\n     - Calculate \\(8 \\times -3\\)\n     - Add the results of the two calculations.\n\n   - For the second part: \\((5 + -7 - 4 \\times -5)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-4 \\times -5\\)\n     - Add and subtract the results with 5 and -7.\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parts.**\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the first part: (-7 * -9 + 8 * -3)\npart1 = (-7 * -9) + (8 * -3)\n\n# Calculate the second part: (5 + -7 - 4 * -5)\npart2 = 5 + (-7) - (4 * -5)\n\n# Multiply the results of the two parts\nresult = part1 * part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final result.",
    "The code execution result provided the output of 702, which indicates that the calculations were performed correctly according to the order of operations. Let's verify the steps:\n\n1. **First Part Calculation:**\n   - \\(-7 \\times -9 = 63\\)\n   - \\(8 \\times -3 = -24\\)\n   - Adding these results: \\(63 + (-24) = 39\\)\n\n2. **Second Part Calculation:**\n   - \\(-4 \\times -5 = 20\\)\n   - Adding and subtracting: \\(5 + (-7) + 20 = 18\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - \\(39 \\times 18 = 702\\)\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the code execution result. Therefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'702'>>>"
