    "To solve the expression \\(((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 * -4))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   9 - 3 + 2 + (-1)\n   \\]\n   - \\(9 - 3 = 6\\)\n   - \\(6 + 2 = 8\\)\n   - \\(8 + (-1) = 7\\)\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is 7.\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   5 - (-1) - (-6 \\times -4)\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(-6 \\times -4 = 24\\)\n   - Then, evaluate the expression: \n     - \\(5 - (-1) = 5 + 1 = 6\\)\n     - \\(6 - 24 = -18\\)\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(-18\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   7 - (-18)\n   \\]\n   - \\(7 + 18 = 25\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 25.\n\n<<<answer>>> 25"
