    "To solve the expression \\(((6 - 1 - -3 + -2) + (5 * 5 + -1 - -8))\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.\n\n1. **First Part: \\(6 - 1 - -3 + -2\\)**\n   - Start with \\(6 - 1\\), which equals \\(5\\).\n   - Then, subtract \\(-3\\) (which is equivalent to adding 3), so \\(5 + 3 = 8\\).\n   - Finally, add \\(-2\\) (which is equivalent to subtracting 2), so \\(8 - 2 = 6\\).\n\n2. **Second Part: \\(5 * 5 + -1 - -8\\)**\n   - Start with \\(5 * 5\\), which equals \\(25\\).\n   - Then, add \\(-1\\) (which is equivalent to subtracting 1), so \\(25 - 1 = 24\\).\n   - Finally, subtract \\(-8\\) (which is equivalent to adding 8), so \\(24 + 8 = 32\\).\n\n3. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Add the results of the two parts: \\(6 + 32 = 38\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 38.\n\n<<<38>>>"
