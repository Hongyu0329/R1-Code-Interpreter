    "To solve the expression \\(((-4 + -5 * 7 + 7) + (3 * -3 - -4 + 4))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-4 + -5 * 7 + 7\\)\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-5 * 7 = -35\\)\n   - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-4 + (-35) = -39\\)\n     - \\(-39 + 7 = -32\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\(3 * -3 - -4 + 4\\)\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(3 * -3 = -9\\)\n   - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-9 - (-4) = -9 + 4 = -5\\)\n     - \\(-5 + 4 = -1\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parentheses:**\n   \\((-32) + (-1) = -33\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-33\\).\n\n<<<-33>>>"
