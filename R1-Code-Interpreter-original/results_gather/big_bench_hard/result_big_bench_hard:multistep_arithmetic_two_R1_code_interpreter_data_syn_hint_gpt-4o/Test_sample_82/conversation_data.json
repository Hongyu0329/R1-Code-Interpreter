    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 6 - 8 \\times -9) - (9 - 9 \\times -2 + -1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(-8 + 6 - 8 \\times -9\\)\n     - Calculate the multiplication: \\(-8 \\times -9 = 72\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(-8 + 6 + 72\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction: \\(-8 + 6 = -2\\), then \\(-2 + 72 = 70\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(9 - 9 \\times -2 + -1\\)\n     - Calculate the multiplication: \\(9 \\times -2 = -18\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(9 + 18 - 1\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction: \\(9 + 18 = 27\\), then \\(27 - 1 = 26\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - \\(70 - 26 = 44\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -8 + 6 - 8 * -9\npart2 = 9 - 9 * -2 + -1\nresult = part1 - part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is correct. The expression \\(((-8 + 6 - 8 \\times -9) - (9 - 9 \\times -2 + -1))\\) evaluates to 44.\n\nSince the code execution matches the manual calculation, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'44'>>>"
