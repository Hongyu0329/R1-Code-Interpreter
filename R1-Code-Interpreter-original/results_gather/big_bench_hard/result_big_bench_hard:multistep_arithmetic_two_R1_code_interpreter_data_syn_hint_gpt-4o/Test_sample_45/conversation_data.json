    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 - 6 \\times 5 + -9) + (1 + -4 - -2 \\times 6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses**: \\(-5 - 6 \\times 5 + -9\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-5 - 30 + -9\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n     - \\(-5 - 30 = -35\\)\n     - \\(-35 + -9 = -44\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses**: \\(1 + -4 - -2 \\times 6\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-2 \\times 6 = -12\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(1 + -4 - (-12)\\)\n   - Simplify the subtraction of a negative number: \\(1 + -4 + 12\\)\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(1 + -4 = -3\\)\n     - \\(-3 + 12 = 9\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parentheses**: \\((-44) + (9)\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-44 + 9 = -35\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-35\\).\n\n<<<-35>>>"
