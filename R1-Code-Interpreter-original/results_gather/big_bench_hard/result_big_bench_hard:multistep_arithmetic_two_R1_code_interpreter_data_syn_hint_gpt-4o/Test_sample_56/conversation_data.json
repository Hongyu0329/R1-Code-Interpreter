    "To solve the expression \\((1 + 1 \\times 3 - 2) \\times (-8 - -2 - 9 + -9)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(1 + 1 \\times 3 - 2\\)\n     - According to PEMDAS, we first perform the multiplication: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(1 + 3 - 2 = 2\\)\n\n   - The second set of parentheses: \\(-8 - -2 - 9 + -9\\)\n     - Simplify the double negatives: \\(-8 + 2 - 9 - 9\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right: \\(-8 + 2 = -6\\), \\(-6 - 9 = -15\\), \\(-15 - 9 = -24\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the parentheses**:\n   - \\(2 \\times -24 = -48\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (1 + 1 * 3 - 2) * (-8 - -2 - 9 + -9)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms our manual calculation. The expression \\((1 + 1 \\times 3 - 2) \\times (-8 - -2 - 9 + -9)\\) evaluates to \\(-48\\).\n\nSince the code execution matches the expected result, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
