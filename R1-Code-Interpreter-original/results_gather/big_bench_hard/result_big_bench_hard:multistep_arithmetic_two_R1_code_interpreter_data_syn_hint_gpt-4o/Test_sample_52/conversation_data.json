    "To solve the expression \\((1 + 3 - -5 - 4) + (-3 - -3 + 6 * 9)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(1 + 3 - -5 - 4\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(1 + 3 + 5 - 4 = 5\\)\n   - The second part: \\(-3 - -3 + 6 * 9\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(-3 + 3 + 6 * 9\\)\n\n2. **Perform multiplication**:\n   - In the second part: \\(6 * 9 = 54\\)\n\n3. **Continue simplifying the second part**:\n   - \\(-3 + 3 + 54 = 54\\)\n\n4. **Add the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\(5 + 54 = 59\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (1 + 3 - -5 - 4) + (-3 - -3 + 6 * 9)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression \\((1 + 3 - -5 - 4) + (-3 - -3 + 6 * 9)\\) is indeed 59. The steps followed in the reasoning process were correct, and the code verified the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'59'>>>"
