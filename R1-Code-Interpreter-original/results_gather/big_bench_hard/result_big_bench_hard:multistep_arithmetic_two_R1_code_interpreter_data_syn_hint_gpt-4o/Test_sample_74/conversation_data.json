    "To solve the expression \\(((-3 - -6 - -7 + 3) + (5 * 5 * 1 - -3))\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the first part**: \\(-3 - -6 - -7 + 3\\)\n   - \\(-3 - -6\\) is equivalent to \\(-3 + 6 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3 - -7\\) is equivalent to \\(3 + 7 = 10\\)\n   - \\(10 + 3 = 13\\)\n\n2. **Simplify the second part**: \\(5 * 5 * 1 - -3\\)\n   - \\(5 * 5 = 25\\)\n   - \\(25 * 1 = 25\\)\n   - \\(25 - -3\\) is equivalent to \\(25 + 3 = 28\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results**: \n   - \\(13 + 28 = 41\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -3 - -6 - -7 + 3\npart2 = 5 * 5 * 1 - -3\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is indeed 41. The step-by-step breakdown and the code both lead to the same result, ensuring the accuracy of the solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((-3 - -6 - -7 + 3) + (5 * 5 * 1 - -3))\\) is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 41"
