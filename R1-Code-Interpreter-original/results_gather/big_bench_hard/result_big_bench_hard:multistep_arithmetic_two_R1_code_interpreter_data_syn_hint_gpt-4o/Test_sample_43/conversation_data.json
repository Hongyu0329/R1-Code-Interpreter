    "To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: We have two sets of parentheses in the expression. We will solve each one separately.\n\n   - First set: \\((-2 * -8 * 9 + -5)\\)\n     - Multiplication: \\(-2 * -8 = 16\\)\n     - Multiplication: \\(16 * 9 = 144\\)\n     - Addition: \\(144 + -5 = 139\\)\n\n   - Second set: \\((7 - -1 - -4 - 1)\\)\n     - Subtraction: \\(7 - -1 = 7 + 1 = 8\\)\n     - Subtraction: \\(8 - -4 = 8 + 4 = 12\\)\n     - Subtraction: \\(12 - 1 = 11\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results of the parentheses**: \n   - \\(139 + 11 = 150\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = ((-2 * -8 * 9 + -5) + (7 - -1 - -4 - 1))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is correct. The expression was evaluated step by step, following the order of operations, and the final result is 150.\n\nSince the code execution has verified the calculation, I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'150'>>>"
