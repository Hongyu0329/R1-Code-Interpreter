    "To solve the expression \\((9 - -6 \\times 9 \\times 4) - (6 - 4 \\times -8 \\times -7)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(-6 \\times 9 \\times 4\\)\n   - For the second part: \\(-4 \\times -8 \\times -7\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the results of these multiplications:**\n\n   - \\(-6 \\times 9 = -54\\)\n   - \\(-54 \\times 4 = -216\\)\n\n   - \\(-4 \\times -8 = 32\\)\n   - \\(32 \\times -7 = -224\\)\n\n3. **Substitute these results back into the expression:**\n\n   - The expression becomes: \\((9 - (-216)) - (6 - (-224))\\)\n\n4. **Simplify the expression:**\n\n   - \\(9 - (-216) = 9 + 216 = 225\\)\n   - \\(6 - (-224) = 6 + 224 = 230\\)\n\n5. **Subtract the results:**\n\n   - \\(225 - 230 = -5\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the expression components\npart1 = -6 * 9 * 4\npart2 = -4 * -8 * -7\n\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (9 - part1) - (6 - part2)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated result of the expression \\((9 - -6 \\times 9 \\times 4) - (6 - 4 \\times -8 \\times -7)\\) is indeed \\(-5\\). The steps followed in the reasoning process and the code execution both align and verify the correctness of the solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'-5'>>>"
