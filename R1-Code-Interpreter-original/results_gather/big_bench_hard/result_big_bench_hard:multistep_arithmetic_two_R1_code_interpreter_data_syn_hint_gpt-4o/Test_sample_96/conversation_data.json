    "To solve the expression \\((9 + 2 + 3 - -3) + (-5 + 6 - -6 - -9)\\), we need to evaluate each part of the expression step by step.\n\n1. Evaluate the first part: \\(9 + 2 + 3 - -3\\)\n   - \\(9 + 2 = 11\\)\n   - \\(11 + 3 = 14\\)\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding: \\(14 - -3 = 14 + 3 = 17\\)\n\n2. Evaluate the second part: \\(-5 + 6 - -6 - -9\\)\n   - \\(-5 + 6 = 1\\)\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding: \\(1 - -6 = 1 + 6 = 7\\)\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding: \\(7 - -9 = 7 + 9 = 16\\)\n\n3. Add the results of the two parts: \\(17 + 16 = 33\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 33.\n\n<<<answer>>>33"
