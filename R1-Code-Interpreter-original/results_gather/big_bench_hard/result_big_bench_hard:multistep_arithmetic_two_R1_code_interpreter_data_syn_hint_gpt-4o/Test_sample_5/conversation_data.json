    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 4 \\times 2 - 6) + (1 + -2 \\times 1 \\times 7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. Start with the first set of parentheses: \\((-6 - 4 \\times 2 - 6)\\).\n   - Calculate the multiplication: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-6 - 8 - 6\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\).\n   - Then, \\(-14 - 6 = -20\\).\n\n2. Move to the second set of parentheses: \\((1 + -2 \\times 1 \\times 7)\\).\n   - Calculate the multiplication: \\(-2 \\times 1 = -2\\).\n   - Then, \\(-2 \\times 7 = -14\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(1 + (-14)\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(1 - 14 = -13\\).\n\n3. Combine the results of the two parentheses: \\((-20) + (-13)\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-20 - 13 = -33\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nresult = ((-6 - 4 * 2 - 6) + (1 + -2 * 1 * 7))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms the manual calculation. The expression \\(((-6 - 4 \\times 2 - 6) + (1 + -2 \\times 1 \\times 7))\\) evaluates to \\(-33\\).\n\nSince both the manual calculation and the code execution agree, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>> -33 <<<answer>>>"
