    "To solve the expression \\((4 + 7 \\times 4 - -5) - (-4 - 1 - -4 - 4)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication**: \n   - \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)\n\n2. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - \\((4 + 28 - -5) - (-4 - 1 - -4 - 4)\\)\n\n3. **Simplify the first part of the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(4 + 28 = 32\\)\n   - \\(32 - -5 = 32 + 5 = 37\\)\n\n4. **Simplify the second part of the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - \\(-4 - 1 = -5\\)\n   - \\(-5 - -4 = -5 + 4 = -1\\)\n   - \\(-1 - 4 = -5\\)\n\n5. **Substitute back into the expression**:\n   - \\(37 - (-5)\\)\n\n6. **Simplify the final expression**:\n   - \\(37 - (-5) = 37 + 5 = 42\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is 42.\n\n<<<answer>>> 42"
