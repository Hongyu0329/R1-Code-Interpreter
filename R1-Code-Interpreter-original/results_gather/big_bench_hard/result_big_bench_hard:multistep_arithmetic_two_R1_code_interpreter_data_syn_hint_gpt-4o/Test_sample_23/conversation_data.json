    "To solve the expression \\((1 - 7 - -8 \\times 3) + (-7 - -2 + -3 \\times 6)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication operations**:\n   - \\(-8 \\times 3 = -24\\)\n   - \\(-3 \\times 6 = -18\\)\n\n2. **Substitute these values back into the expression**:\n   - The expression becomes \\((1 - 7 - (-24)) + (-7 - (-2) + (-18))\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(1 - 7 - (-24) = 1 - 7 + 24 = 18\\)\n   - For the second part: \\(-7 - (-2) + (-18) = -7 + 2 - 18 = -23\\)\n\n4. **Add the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\(18 + (-23) = 18 - 23 = -5\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 1 - 7 - (-8 * 3)\npart2 = -7 - (-2) + (-3 * 6)\nresult = part1 + part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final result.",
    "The code execution result confirms our manual calculation. The expression \\((1 - 7 - -8 \\times 3) + (-7 - -2 + -3 \\times 6)\\) evaluates to \\(-5\\).\n\nSince the code execution matches the expected result, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>> -5 <<<answer>>>"
