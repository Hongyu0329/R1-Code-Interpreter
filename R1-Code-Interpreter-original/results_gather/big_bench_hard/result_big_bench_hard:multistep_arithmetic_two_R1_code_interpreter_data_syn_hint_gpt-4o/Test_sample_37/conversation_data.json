    "To solve the expression \\(((0 - -1 + -1 + -3) - (-3 * 0 * 8 + 6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part inside the parentheses is \\(0 - -1 + -1 + -3\\).\n     - \\(0 - -1\\) is equivalent to \\(0 + 1 = 1\\).\n     - \\(1 + -1 = 0\\).\n     - \\(0 + -3 = -3\\).\n   - So, the first part simplifies to \\(-3\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part inside the parentheses**:\n   - The second part is \\(-3 * 0 * 8 + 6\\).\n     - \\(-3 * 0 = 0\\).\n     - \\(0 * 8 = 0\\).\n     - \\(0 + 6 = 6\\).\n   - So, the second part simplifies to \\(6\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - Now, substitute back into the expression: \\((-3) - (6)\\).\n   - \\(-3 - 6 = -9\\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is \\(-9\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-9<<<answer>>>"
