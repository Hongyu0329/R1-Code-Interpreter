    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 - -6 * 7 * 0) * (0 + -5 * -8 - 0))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(-8 - (-6 * 7 * 0)\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-6 * 7 * 0 = 0\\) because any number multiplied by zero is zero.\n     - So, \\(-8 - 0 = -8\\).\n\n   - The second part: \\(0 + (-5 * -8) - 0\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-5 * -8 = 40\\) because the product of two negative numbers is positive.\n     - So, \\(0 + 40 - 0 = 40\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the parentheses**:\n   - \\((-8) * (40) = -320\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -8 - (-6 * 7 * 0)\npart2 = 0 + (-5 * -8) - 0\nresult = part1 * part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is \\(-320\\). The steps followed in the reasoning process were correct, and the code verified the result accurately.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((-8 - -6 * 7 * 0) * (0 + -5 * -8 - 0))\\) is:\n\n<<<-320>>>"
