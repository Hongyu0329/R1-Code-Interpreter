    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 - 2 \\times 2 + 0) - (7 - 6 - -7 - -1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-2 - 2 \\times 2 + 0\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n   - Then, substitute back into the expression: \\(-2 - 4 + 0\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(-2 - 4 = -6\\)\n   - Add 0: \\(-6 + 0 = -6\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\(7 - 6 - -7 - -1\\)\n   - Simplify the double negatives: \\(- -7 = +7\\) and \\(- -1 = +1\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(7 - 6 + 7 + 1\\)\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     - \\(7 - 6 = 1\\)\n     - \\(1 + 7 = 8\\)\n     - \\(8 + 1 = 9\\)\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses:**\n   \\(-6 - 9\\)\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(-6 - 9 = -15\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-15\\).\n\n<<<-15>>>"
