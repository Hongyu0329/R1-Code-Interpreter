    "To solve the expression \\((6 - 0 \\times 5 + -3) \\times (6 - -7 + -2 - -7)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(6 - 0 \\times 5 + -3\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n     - \\(6 - 0 + -3 = 6 - 3 = 3\\)\n\n   - The second part: \\(6 - -7 + -2 - -7\\)\n     - \\(6 - -7 = 6 + 7 = 13\\)\n     - \\(13 + -2 = 13 - 2 = 11\\)\n     - \\(11 - -7 = 11 + 7 = 18\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the parentheses**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 18 = 54\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = 6 - 0 * 5 + -3\npart2 = 6 - -7 + -2 - -7\nresult = part1 * part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is 54. The code correctly followed the order of operations to evaluate the expression step by step. \n\nSince the code execution result matches the expected outcome, we can confidently conclude that the final answer is correct.\n\n<<<answer>>> 54"
