    "To solve the expression \\((3 - -6 - 7 + 3) + (-7 + 6 \\times 9 + 8)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(3 - -6 - 7 + 3\\)\n     - \\(3 - -6\\) is equivalent to \\(3 + 6 = 9\\)\n     - \\(9 - 7 = 2\\)\n     - \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(-7 + 6 \\times 9 + 8\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\)\n     - Then, \\(-7 + 54 = 47\\)\n     - Finally, \\(47 + 8 = 55\\)\n\n2. **Add the results from the two parts:**\n\n   - \\(5 + 55 = 60\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is 60.\n\n<<<answer>>> 60"
