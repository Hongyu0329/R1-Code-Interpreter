    "To solve the expression \\(((5 - -2 * -9 + 8) - (3 - 4 * -3 - -6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-2 * -9 = 18\\)\n   - \\(4 * -3 = -12\\)\n\n2. **Substitute these values back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\(((5 - 18 + 8) - (3 - (-12) - -6))\\).\n\n3. **Simplify inside the parentheses:**\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(5 - 18 + 8 = -5\\)\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(3 - (-12) - -6 = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21\\)\n\n4. **Substitute these simplified values back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\((-5) - (21)\\).\n\n5. **Finally, perform the subtraction:**\n   - \\(-5 - 21 = -26\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(-26\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-26<<<answer>>>"
