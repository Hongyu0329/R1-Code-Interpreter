    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 + 8 - -4 * 2) - (1 - 9 + -6 * 3))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(-9 + 8 - -4 * 2\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-4 * 2 = -8\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(-9 + 8 - (-8)\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(-9 + 8 + 8 = 7\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(1 - 9 + -6 * 3\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-6 * 3 = -18\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(1 - 9 - 18\\)\n     - Simplify: \\(1 - 9 - 18 = -26\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\(7 - (-26)\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(7 + 26 = 33\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_part = -9 + 8 - (-4 * 2)\nsecond_part = 1 - 9 + (-6 * 3)\nresult = first_part - second_part\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is indeed 33. The reasoning and calculations were correct, and the code verified this result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((-9 + 8 - -4 * 2) - (1 - 9 + -6 * 3))\\) is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 33"
