    "To solve the expression \\(((9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8) + (6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication and addition/subtraction inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8\\)\n     - \\(9 \\times 4 = 36\\)\n     - \\(36 - 6 = 30\\)\n     - \\(30 - -8 = 30 + 8 = 38\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3\\)\n     - \\(-4 \\times 3 = -12\\)\n     - \\(6 - 8 = -2\\)\n     - \\(-2 - -12 = -2 + 12 = 10\\)\n\n2. **Add the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - \\(38 + 10 = 48\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = (9 * 4 - 6 - -8)\npart2 = (6 - 8 - -4 * 3)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression \\(((9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8) + (6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3))\\) is indeed 48. The code correctly followed the order of operations and provided the expected result.\n\nSince the code execution result matches the manual calculation, we can confidently conclude that the final answer is correct.\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 48"
