    "To solve the expression \\(((8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8) - (2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(3 \\times -8 = -24\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \n       - \\(8 + (-24) = -16\\)\n       - \\(-16 - (-8) = -16 + 8 = -8\\)\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(2 \\times -9 = -18\\)\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n       - \\(2 + (-18) = -16\\)\n       - \\(-16 - 6 = -22\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\((-8) - (-22)\\)\n   - This is equivalent to \\(-8 + 22\\) because subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive.\n   - \\(-8 + 22 = 14\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_parentheses = 8 + 3 * -8 - -8\nsecond_parentheses = 2 + 2 * -9 - 6\nresult = first_parentheses - second_parentheses\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<'answer'>>>",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression \\(((8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8) - (2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6))\\) is indeed 14. The step-by-step breakdown and the code both lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<'14'>>>"
