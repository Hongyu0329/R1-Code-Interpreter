    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - -1 - -5 * -5) + (8 + -5 - 9 * -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(-6 - -1 - -5 * -5\\)\n     - \\(-6 - -1\\) becomes \\(-6 + 1 = -5\\)\n     - \\(-5 * -5\\) becomes \\(25\\)\n     - So, \\(-5 - 25 = -30\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(8 + -5 - 9 * -7\\)\n     - \\(8 + -5\\) becomes \\(3\\)\n     - \\(-9 * -7\\) becomes \\(63\\)\n     - So, \\(3 - 63 = -60\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results from both parts**:\n   - \\((-30) + (-60) = -90\\)\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -6 - (-1) - (-5 * -5)\npart2 = 8 + (-5) - (9 * -7)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the calculation process. Let's go through the expression again and correct any mistakes.\n\nThe expression is: \\(((-6 - -1 - -5 * -5) + (8 + -5 - 9 * -7))\\).\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - For the first part: \\(-6 - -1 - -5 * -5\\)\n     - \\(-6 - -1\\) becomes \\(-6 + 1 = -5\\)\n     - \\(-5 * -5\\) becomes \\(25\\)\n     - So, \\(-5 - 25 = -30\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(8 + -5 - 9 * -7\\)\n     - \\(8 + -5\\) becomes \\(3\\)\n     - \\(-9 * -7\\) becomes \\(-63\\)\n     - So, \\(3 - (-63) = 3 + 63 = 66\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results from both parts**:\n   - \\((-30) + 66 = 36\\)\n\nThe previous code output was correct, but the reasoning had a mistake in the multiplication sign. Let's confirm the final result:\n\n```python\n# Recalculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -6 - (-1) - (-5 * -5)\npart2 = 8 + (-5) - (9 * -7)\nresult = part1 + part2\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution result of 36 is correct based on the corrected reasoning. The initial mistake was in the manual calculation, not in the code. The code correctly evaluates the expression \\(((-6 - -1 - -5 * -5) + (8 + -5 - 9 * -7))\\) to 36.\n\nTo ensure clarity and correctness, let's break down the expression one more time:\n\n1. **First part**: \\(-6 - -1 - -5 * -5\\)\n   - \\(-6 - -1\\) becomes \\(-6 + 1 = -5\\)\n   - \\(-5 * -5\\) becomes \\(25\\)\n   - \\(-5 - 25 = -30\\)\n\n2. **Second part**: \\(8 + -5 - 9 * -7\\)\n   - \\(8 + -5\\) becomes \\(3\\)\n   - \\(-9 * -7\\) becomes \\(-63\\)\n   - \\(3 - (-63) = 3 + 63 = 66\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - \\((-30) + 66 = 36\\)\n\nThe code correctly reflects this calculation, and the final result is indeed 36.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
