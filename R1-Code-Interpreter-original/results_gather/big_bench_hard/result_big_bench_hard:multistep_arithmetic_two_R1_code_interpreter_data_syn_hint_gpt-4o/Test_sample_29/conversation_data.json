    "To solve the expression \\((3 + -1 \\times 7 \\times -6) - (-7 \\times -1 + -5 - -3)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-1 \\times 7 \\times -6\\) is evaluated first. \n   - \\(-1 \\times 7 = -7\\)\n   - \\(-7 \\times -6 = 42\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the first part of the expression:**\n   - \\(3 + 42 = 45\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the second part of the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-7 \\times -1 = 7\\)\n   - \\(-5 - -3 = -5 + 3 = -2\\)\n   - \\(7 + -2 = 5\\)\n\n4. **Subtract the second part from the first part:**\n   - \\(45 - 5 = 40\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nresult = (3 + (-1 * 7 * -6)) - ((-7 * -1) + (-5 - -3))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms the calculation we performed manually. The expression evaluates to 40, and there were no errors in the code execution. The code was straightforward and correctly implemented the arithmetic operations according to the order of operations.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\((3 + -1 \\times 7 \\times -6) - (-7 \\times -1 + -5 - -3)\\) is:\n\n<<<'40'>>>"
