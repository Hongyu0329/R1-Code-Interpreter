    "To solve the expression \\(((7 \\times 9 \\times 3 \\times 6) \\times (-8 \\times -6 + -9 + -5))\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the first part of the expression: \\(7 \\times 9 \\times 3 \\times 6\\).**\n\n2. **Calculate the second part of the expression inside the parentheses: \\(-8 \\times -6 + -9 + -5\\).**\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parts together.**\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the first part\npart1 = 7 * 9 * 3 * 6\n\n# Calculate the second part\npart2 = (-8 * -6) + (-9) + (-5)\n\n# Multiply the results of the two parts\nresult = part1 * part2\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the final result of the expression.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the calculation was performed correctly, and the result of the expression \\(((7 \\times 9 \\times 3 \\times 6) \\times (-8 \\times -6 + -9 + -5))\\) is 38,556.\n\nLet's break down the steps to ensure the accuracy of the result:\n\n1. **First part calculation:**\n   - \\(7 \\times 9 = 63\\)\n   - \\(63 \\times 3 = 189\\)\n   - \\(189 \\times 6 = 1134\\)\n\n2. **Second part calculation:**\n   - \\(-8 \\times -6 = 48\\)\n   - \\(48 + (-9) = 39\\)\n   - \\(39 + (-5) = 34\\)\n\n3. **Final multiplication:**\n   - \\(1134 \\times 34 = 38,556\\)\n\nThe calculations confirm that the result is correct.
