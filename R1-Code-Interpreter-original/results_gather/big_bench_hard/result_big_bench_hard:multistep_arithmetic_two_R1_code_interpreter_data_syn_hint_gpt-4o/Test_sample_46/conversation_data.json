    "To solve the expression \\((-8 + 0 \\times 0 \\times -1) - (7 + -1 + -3 \\times -2)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\(-8 + 0 \\times 0 \\times -1\\)\n   - The multiplication part \\(0 \\times 0 \\times -1\\) results in \\(0\\).\n   - So, the expression simplifies to \\(-8 + 0 = -8\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\(7 + -1 + -3 \\times -2\\)\n   - The multiplication part \\(-3 \\times -2\\) results in \\(6\\).\n   - So, the expression simplifies to \\(7 + -1 + 6\\).\n   - Simplifying further: \\(7 - 1 = 6\\), and \\(6 + 6 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses:**\n   \\(-8 - 12 = -20\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-20\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-20<<<answer>>>"
