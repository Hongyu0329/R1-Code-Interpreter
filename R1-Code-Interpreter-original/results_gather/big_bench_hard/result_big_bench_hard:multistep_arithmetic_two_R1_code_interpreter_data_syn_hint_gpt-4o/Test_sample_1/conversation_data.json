    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 \\times -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 \\times -3 \\times 1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expressions:**\n   - \\(-9 \\times -5\\) results in \\(45\\).\n   - \\(-6 \\times -3 \\times 1\\) results in \\(18\\).\n\n2. **Substitute back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\(((45 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - 18))\\).\n\n3. **Simplify inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(45 - 6 + -2\\) results in \\(37\\).\n   - \\(-8 - 18\\) results in \\(-26\\).\n\n4. **Substitute back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\((37 - (-26))\\).\n\n5. **Simplify the final expression:**\n   - \\(37 - (-26)\\) is equivalent to \\(37 + 26\\), which results in \\(63\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(63\\).\n\n<<<'63'>>>"
