    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 - -9 * 8 - -9) + (-9 - 2 * -6 + -6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\((-1 - -9 * 8 - -9)\\).\n   - The expression inside the second set of parentheses is \\((-9 - 2 * -6 + -6)\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the multiplication**:\n   - In the first set: \\(-9 * 8 = -72\\).\n   - In the second set: \\(-2 * -6 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Substitute back into the expressions**:\n   - First set: \\((-1 - (-72) - (-9))\\).\n   - Second set: \\((-9 + 12 + (-6))\\).\n\n4. **Simplify the expressions**:\n   - First set: \\(-1 + 72 + 9 = 80\\).\n   - Second set: \\(-9 + 12 - 6 = -3\\).\n\n5. **Add the results of the two sets**:\n   - \\(80 + (-3) = 77\\).\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\nfirst_set = -1 - (-9 * 8) - (-9)\nsecond_set = -9 - (2 * -6) + (-6)\nresult = first_set + second_set\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<'answer'>>>",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is indeed 77. The step-by-step breakdown and the code both lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((-1 - -9 * 8 - -9) + (-9 - 2 * -6 + -6))\\) is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 77"
