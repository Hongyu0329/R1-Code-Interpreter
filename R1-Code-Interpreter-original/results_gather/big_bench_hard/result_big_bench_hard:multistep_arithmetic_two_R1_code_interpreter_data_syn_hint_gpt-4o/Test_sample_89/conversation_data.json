    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 + -4 + 0 \\times -1) \\times (4 \\times -3 \\times -8 - -4))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first set of parentheses: \\(-9 + -4 + 0 \\times -1\\)\n     - Calculate \\(0 \\times -1 = 0\\)\n     - Then, \\(-9 + -4 + 0 = -13\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**:\n   - \\(4 \\times -3 \\times -8 - -4\\)\n     - First, calculate \\(4 \\times -3 = -12\\)\n     - Then, \\(-12 \\times -8 = 96\\)\n     - Finally, \\(96 - -4 = 100\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - \\((-13) \\times 100 = -1300\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -9 + -4 + 0 * -1\npart2 = 4 * -3 * -8 - -4\nresult = part1 * part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<-1300>>>",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculated value of the expression is \\(-1300\\). The code correctly followed the order of operations and computed the expression step by step. \n\nSince the task was to evaluate a mathematical expression, the code provided was appropriate for the complexity of the task. The expression was straightforward and did not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((-9 + -4 + 0 \\times -1) \\times (4 \\times -3 \\times -8 - -4))\\) is:\n\n<<<-1300>>>"
