    "To solve the expression \\(((-3 - 8 \\times 5 + 5) - (-1 \\times -3 - -2 - 6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part: \\(-3 - 8 \\times 5 + 5\\)\n     - Perform the multiplication: \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(-3 - 40 + 5\\)\n     - Perform the subtraction and addition from left to right: \\(-3 - 40 = -43\\), then \\(-43 + 5 = -38\\)\n\n   - The second part: \\(-1 \\times -3 - -2 - 6\\)\n     - Perform the multiplication: \\(-1 \\times -3 = 3\\)\n     - Substitute back: \\(3 - -2 - 6\\)\n     - Simplify the double negative: \\(3 + 2 - 6\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\), then \\(5 - 6 = -1\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the results of the two parts**:\n   - \\((-38) - (-1)\\)\n   - Simplify the double negative: \\(-38 + 1\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-38 + 1 = -37\\)\n\nThus, the final result of the expression is \\(-37\\).\n\n<<<answer>>>-37"
