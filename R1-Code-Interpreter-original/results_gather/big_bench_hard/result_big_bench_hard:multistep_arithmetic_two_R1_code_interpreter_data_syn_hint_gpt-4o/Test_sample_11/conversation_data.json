    "To solve the expression \\(((2 - -2 + -7 * 8) * (-7 * -8 * 3 - -2))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:\n   - The first part inside the parentheses is \\(2 - -2 + -7 * 8\\).\n     - \\(2 - -2\\) is equivalent to \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).\n     - \\(-7 * 8 = -56\\).\n     - So, \\(4 + (-56) = 4 - 56 = -52\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part inside the parentheses**:\n   - The second part is \\(-7 * -8 * 3 - -2\\).\n     - \\(-7 * -8 = 56\\) (since multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result).\n     - \\(56 * 3 = 168\\).\n     - \\(- -2\\) is equivalent to \\(+2\\).\n     - So, \\(168 + 2 = 170\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parts**:\n   - Now, we multiply the results of the two simplified parts: \\((-52) * (170)\\).\n\nLet's calculate this multiplication using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (-52) * (170)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the final result.",
    "The code execution result of \\((-52) * (170)\\) is \\(-8840\\), which matches our expectations based on the manual calculation. Therefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((2 - -2 + -7 * 8) * (-7 * -8 * 3 - -2))\\) is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
