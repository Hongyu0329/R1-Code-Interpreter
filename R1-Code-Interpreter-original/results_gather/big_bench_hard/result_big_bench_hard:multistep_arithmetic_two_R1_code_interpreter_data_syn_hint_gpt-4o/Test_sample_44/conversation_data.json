    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 - 5 \\times -5 - 6) + (-5 \\times -4 + 2 + -2))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-5 \\times -5 = 25\\)\n   - \\(-5 \\times -4 = 20\\)\n\n2. **Substitute these values back into the expression:**\n   - \\((-2 - 25 - 6) + (20 + 2 - 2)\\)\n\n3. **Simplify each part inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-2 - 25 - 6 = -33\\)\n   - \\(20 + 2 - 2 = 20\\)\n\n4. **Combine the results from the parentheses:**\n   - \\(-33 + 20 = -13\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression step by step\npart1 = -2 - 5 * -5 - 6\npart2 = -5 * -4 + 2 + -2\nresult = part1 + part2\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
