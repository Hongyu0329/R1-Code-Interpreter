    "To solve the expression \\((1 - 6 \\times 0 - -7) \\times (6 \\times 0 + 6 - -3)\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nLet's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first part: \\(1 - 6 \\times 0 - -7\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n     - So, the expression becomes \\(1 - 0 - -7\\)\n     - Simplifying further: \\(1 - 0 + 7 = 8\\)\n\n   - For the second part: \\(6 \\times 0 + 6 - -3\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n     - So, the expression becomes \\(0 + 6 - -3\\)\n     - Simplifying further: \\(0 + 6 + 3 = 9\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\)\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the expression\nresult = (1 - 6 * 0 - -7) * (6 * 0 + 6 - -3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we find that the result of the expression is 72.\n\n<<<answer>>>72",
    "The code execution result confirms that the calculation of the expression \\((1 - 6 \\times 0 - -7) \\times (6 \\times 0 + 6 - -3)\\) is correct, yielding a result of 72. The code was straightforward because the expression itself was simple and did not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms.\n\nSince the task was to evaluate a straightforward arithmetic expression, the code generated was appropriate for the problem at hand. There is no need for further symbolic computing or optimization in this case.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<answer>>>72"
