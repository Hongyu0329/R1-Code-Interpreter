    "To solve the expression \\(((6 + 1 - 4 - 3) - (-4 * -6 * -3 + 1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\((6 + 1 - 4 - 3)\\)\n   - \\(6 + 1 = 7\\)\n   - \\(7 - 4 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3 - 3 = 0\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\((-4 * -6 * -3 + 1)\\)\n   - First, perform the multiplication:\n     - \\(-4 * -6 = 24\\)\n     - \\(24 * -3 = -72\\)\n   - Then, add 1:\n     - \\(-72 + 1 = -71\\)\n\n3. **Subtract the result of the second parentheses from the result of the first parentheses:**\n   \\((0 - (-71))\\)\n   - This is equivalent to \\(0 + 71 = 71\\)\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is 71.\n\n<<<answer>>> 71"
