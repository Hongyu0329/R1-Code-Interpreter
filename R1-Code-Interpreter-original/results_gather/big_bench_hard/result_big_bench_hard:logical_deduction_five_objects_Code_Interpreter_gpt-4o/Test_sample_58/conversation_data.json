The hawk is to the right of the crow.\n3. The quail is to the left of the crow.\n4. The robin is to the right of the owl.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the hawk is the third from the left, the order must be: _ _ Hawk _ _.\n\n- The hawk is to the right of the crow, so the crow must be in one of the first two positions: Crow _ Hawk _ _ or _ Crow Hawk _ _.\n\n- The quail is to the left of the crow, so the quail must be in the first position if the crow is in the second position: Quail Crow Hawk _ _.\n\n- The robin is to the right of the owl, so the owl must be in the fourth position and the robin in the fifth position: Quail Crow Hawk Owl Robin.\n\nThus, the order of the birds is: Quail, Crow, Hawk, Owl, Robin.\n\nThe leftmost bird is the quail.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The quail is the leftmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"
