The quail is the rightmost.\n4. The raven is the third from the left.\n\nLet's arrange the birds step by step:\n\n- Since the owl is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n- The raven is the third from the left, so it occupies the third position.\n- The robin is to the left of the raven, so it must be in the second position.\n- The quail is the rightmost, so it occupies the fifth position.\n- The only remaining position is the fourth, which must be occupied by the falcon.\n\nThe arrangement is: Owl, Robin, Raven, Falcon, Quail.\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is the leftmost:\n\n- The owl is the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The owl is the leftmost.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
