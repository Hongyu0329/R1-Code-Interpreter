    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n2. The mangoes are less expensive than the pears.\n3. The apples are the second-cheapest.\n4. The watermelons are less expensive than the mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that the apples are the second-cheapest. This means there is only one fruit cheaper than apples.\n- From statement 1, watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, so cantaloupes cannot be the most expensive.\n- From statement 4, watermelons are less expensive than mangoes, so mangoes cannot be the cheapest.\n- From statement 2, mangoes are less expensive than pears, so pears cannot be the cheapest.\n\nGiven that apples are the second-cheapest, the cheapest fruit must be cantaloupes. This gives us:\n\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Apples\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining fruits: watermelons, mangoes, and pears.\n\n- Since watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes and less expensive than mangoes, watermelons must be the third in order.\n- Mangoes are less expensive than pears, so mangoes must be the fourth, and pears must be the fifth.\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Apples\n3. Watermelons\n4. Mangoes\n5. Pears\n\nTherefore, the watermelons are the third-most expensive.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
