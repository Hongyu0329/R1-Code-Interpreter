    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Eli.\n2. Amy finished below Mel.\n3. Ada finished second.\n4. Mel finished below Eli.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since Ada finished second, the order must be: [1st, Ada, 3rd, 4th, 5th].\n- Ada finished above Eli, so Eli cannot be 1st. Eli must be 3rd or lower.\n- Mel finished below Eli, so Mel cannot be 3rd. Mel must be 4th or 5th.\n- Amy finished below Mel, so Amy must be 5th.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's fill in the positions:\n\n- Ada is 2nd.\n- Eli must be 3rd (since Mel is below Eli and Amy is below Mel).\n- Mel must be 4th.\n- Amy must be 5th.\n\nThis leaves Joe as the only golfer who can be 1st.\n\nTherefore, the order is: Joe, Ada, Eli, Mel, Amy.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
