The tractor is older than the limousine.\n3. The convertible is older than the sedan.\n4. The convertible is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-newest, there is only one vehicle newer than it. \n- The tractor is newer than the minivan, so the minivan cannot be the newest.\n- The tractor is older than the limousine, so the limousine is newer than the tractor.\n- The convertible is older than the sedan, so the sedan is newer than the convertible.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the order from newest to oldest:\n\n1. Limousine (newest)\n2. Convertible (second-newest)\n3. Sedan\n4. Tractor\n5. Minivan (oldest)\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the second-oldest:\n\n- The order from oldest to newest is: Minivan, Tractor, Sedan, Convertible, Limousine.\n- Therefore, the second-oldest vehicle is the Tractor.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
