    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is the leftmost.\n2. The blue jay is the third from the left.\n3. The raven is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The robin is to the right of the raven.\n\nLet's arrange the birds step by step:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n- The blue jay is the third from the left, so it occupies the third position.\n- The raven is to the right of the blue jay, so it can be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The robin is to the right of the raven, so the raven must be in the fourth position, and the robin in the fifth position.\n\nThis leaves the second position for the quail.\n\nThe order of the birds is:\n1. Cardinal\n2. Quail\n3. Blue Jay\n4. Raven\n5. Robin\n\nThe rightmost bird is the robin.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The robin is the rightmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"
