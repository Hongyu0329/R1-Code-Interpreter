The black book is to the left of the purple book.\n3. The black book is the third from the left.\n4. The brown book is the leftmost.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the brown book is the leftmost, it is in the first position.\n- The black book is the third from the left, so it is in the third position.\n- The purple book must be to the right of the black book, so it cannot be in the first or third position. It must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the purple book, so it must be in the fifth position if the purple book is in the fourth position.\n- The gray book is the only one left, so it must be in the second position.\n\nLet's arrange the books:\n\n1. Brown book\n2. Gray book\n3. Black book\n4. Purple book\n5. Yellow book\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The yellow book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n(B) The brown book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n(C) The gray book is the second from the left - Correct\n(D) The black book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n(E) The purple book is the second from the left - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
