    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished above Dan.\n3. Joe finished below Dan.\n4. Ada finished second.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know Ada is in the second position. Let's denote the positions as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th.\n\n- Ada is 2nd.\n- From condition 1, Mel must be 3rd or 1st.\n- From condition 2, Dan must be below Mel, so Dan is 4th or 5th.\n- From condition 3, Joe must be below Dan, so Joe is 5th if Dan is 4th.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Mel is 3rd, then Dan is 4th, and Joe is 5th. This leaves Rob to be 1st.\n- If Mel is 1st, then Dan is 3rd, and Joe is 4th, which contradicts condition 3 (Joe below Dan).\n\nThus, the only consistent order is:\n1. Rob\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nTherefore, Joe finished last.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
