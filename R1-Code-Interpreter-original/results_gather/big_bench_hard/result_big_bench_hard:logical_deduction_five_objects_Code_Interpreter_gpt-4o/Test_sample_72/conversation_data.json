    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Eve finished last.\n2. Rob finished above Mel.\n3. Amy finished above Rob.\n4. Mya finished third.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- Since Mya finished third, option (D) is correct.\n- Eve is last, so she is in the 5th position.\n- Rob finished above Mel, so Rob is not in the 4th position.\n- Amy finished above Rob, so Amy is not in the 4th or 5th position.\n\nGiven that Mya is third, the possible positions for Amy, Rob, and Mel are 1st, 2nd, and 4th. Since Amy must finish above Rob, Amy cannot be 4th. Therefore, Amy must be 1st or 2nd.\n\nLet's consider the possible orderings:\n\n1. Amy, Rob, Mya, Mel, Eve\n2. Amy, Mel, Mya, Rob, Eve\n\nIn both cases, Mya is third.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
