    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last.\n4. Ada finished last.\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n\n- Since Joe finished second, the order starts with someone else, followed by Joe.\n- Joe finished below Amy, so Amy must be in the first position.\n- Mel finished second-to-last, which means Mel is in the fourth position.\n- Ada finished last, which means Ada is in the fifth position.\n\nGiven these constraints, the order of finish is:\n\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Rob (by process of elimination, since Rob is the only one left)\n4. Mel\n5. Ada\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Ada finished last.\n\n<<<E>>>"
