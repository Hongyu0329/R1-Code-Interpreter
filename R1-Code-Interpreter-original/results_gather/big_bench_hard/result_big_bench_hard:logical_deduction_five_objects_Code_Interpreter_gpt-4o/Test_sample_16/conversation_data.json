    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements:\n\n1. The tractor is newer than the hatchback.\n2. The limousine is the second-newest.\n3. The truck is older than the hatchback.\n4. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it must be the second vehicle in the order from oldest to newest.\n- The limousine is the second-newest, so it must be the fourth vehicle in the order.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, so the truck must come before the hatchback.\n- The tractor is newer than the hatchback, so the tractor must come after the hatchback.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the order:\n\n1. Oldest: Truck\n2. Second-oldest: Convertible\n3. Middle: Hatchback\n4. Second-newest: Limousine\n5. Newest: Tractor\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options:\n\n(A) The hatchback is the second-oldest - Incorrect\n(B) The convertible is the second-oldest - Correct\n(C) The tractor is the second-oldest - Incorrect\n(D) The truck is the second-oldest - Incorrect\n(E) The limousine is the second-oldest - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
