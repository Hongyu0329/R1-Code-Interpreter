    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The orange book is to the right of the red book.\n3. The blue book is the rightmost.\n4. The gray book is to the left of the red book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the blue book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The orange book is to the right of the red book, so the red book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the left of the red book, so the gray book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. The yellow book must be to the left of the gray book, so it could be in the 1st or 2nd position.\n2. The gray book must be to the left of the red book, so it could be in the 2nd or 3rd position.\n3. The red book must be to the left of the orange book, so it could be in the 3rd or 4th position.\n4. The blue book is in the 5th position.\n\nLet's try placing the yellow book in the 1st position:\n\n- Yellow book in 1st position.\n- Gray book in 2nd position (since it must be to the right of the yellow book).\n- Red book in 3rd position (since it must be to the right of the gray book).\n- Orange book in 4th position (since it must be to the right of the red book).\n- Blue book in 5th position.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n1. Gray book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. Orange book is to the right of the red book.\n3. Blue book is the rightmost.\n4. Gray book is to the left of the red book.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: Yellow, Gray, Red, Orange, Blue.\n\nThe second book from the left is the Gray book.\n\nThus, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
