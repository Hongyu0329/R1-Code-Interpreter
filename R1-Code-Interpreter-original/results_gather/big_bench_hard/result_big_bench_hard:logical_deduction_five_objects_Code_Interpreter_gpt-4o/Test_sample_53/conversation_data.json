    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given information:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the sedan.\n2. The tractor is older than the hatchback.\n3. The minivan is the third-newest.\n4. The station wagon is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n\n- Since the minivan is the third-newest, there are two vehicles newer than it. The station wagon is the second-newest, so it is one of the two vehicles newer than the minivan. Therefore, the minivan is older than the station wagon.\n- The sedan must be the newest because the minivan is older than the sedan, and the station wagon is the second-newest.\n- The tractor is older than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the oldest.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles from oldest to newest:\n\n1. Oldest: Tractor\n2. Second-oldest: Hatchback\n3. Middle: Minivan\n4. Second-newest: Station Wagon\n5. Newest: Sedan\n\nTherefore, the hatchback is the second-oldest.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
