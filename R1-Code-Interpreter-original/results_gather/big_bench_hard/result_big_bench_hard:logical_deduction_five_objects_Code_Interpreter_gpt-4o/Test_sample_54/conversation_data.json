    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is the rightmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n4. The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be the rightmost.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be the leftmost.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be the rightmost.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n1. The green book is in position 5.\n2. The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so possible positions for the orange book are 1, 2, or 3.\n3. The purple book must be to the right of the gray book and to the left of the yellow book, so the purple book cannot be in position 1.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n- If the orange book is in position 1, the gray book can be in position 2, the purple book in position 3, and the yellow book in position 4.\n- This arrangement satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is: Orange, Gray, Purple, Yellow, Green.\n\nThe leftmost book is the orange book.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
