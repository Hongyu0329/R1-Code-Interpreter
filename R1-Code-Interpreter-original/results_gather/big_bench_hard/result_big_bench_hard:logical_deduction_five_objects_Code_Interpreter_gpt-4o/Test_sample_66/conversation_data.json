The tractor is older than the hatchback.\n3. The minivan is the third-newest.\n4. The station wagon is the second-newest.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the minivan is the third-newest, there are two vehicles newer than it. According to condition 4, the station wagon is the second-newest, which means there is one vehicle newer than the station wagon.\n- Therefore, the order from newest to oldest for the three newest vehicles is: Newest, Station Wagon, Minivan.\n- The sedan must be one of the two newest vehicles because the minivan is older than the sedan. Therefore, the sedan is the newest.\n- The order from newest to oldest for these three vehicles is: Sedan, Station Wagon, Minivan.\n\nNow, we need to place the tractor and the hatchback:\n\n- According to condition 2, the tractor is older than the hatchback.\n- Since the minivan is the third-newest, the two oldest vehicles must be the tractor and the hatchback.\n- Therefore, the order from oldest to newest for these two vehicles is: Tractor, Hatchback.\n\nCombining all the information, the order from oldest to newest is:\n\n1. Tractor\n2. Hatchback\n3. Minivan\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Sedan\n\nThus, the oldest vehicle is the tractor.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) The tractor is the oldest.\n\n<<<A>>>"
