    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The green book is the rightmost.\n2. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n4. The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since the green book is the rightmost, it is in the 5th position.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in the 1st position.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. The green book is in the 5th position.\n2. The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so possible positions for the gray book are 3rd or 4th.\n3. The purple book must be to the right of the gray book and to the left of the yellow book, so possible positions for the purple book are 2nd or 3rd.\n4. The yellow book must be to the right of the purple book, so possible positions for the yellow book are 3rd or 4th.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n- If the gray book is in the 3rd position, the purple book can be in the 4th position, and the yellow book can be in the 2nd position. This satisfies all conditions.\n\nLet's verify this order:\n\n1. Orange book\n2. Yellow book\n3. Gray book\n4. Purple book\n5. Green book\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- The green book is the rightmost.\n- The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n- The purple book is to the right of the gray book.\n\nTherefore, the yellow book is the second from the right.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The yellow book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<D>>>"
