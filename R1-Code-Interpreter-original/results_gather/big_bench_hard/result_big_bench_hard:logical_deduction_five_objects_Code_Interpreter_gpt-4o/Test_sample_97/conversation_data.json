    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. Peaches are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches.\n3. Kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n4. Loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since kiwis are the third-most expensive, there are two fruits more expensive than kiwis and two fruits cheaper than kiwis.\n- Loquats are the second-cheapest, so there is only one fruit cheaper than loquats.\n- Peaches are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be the most expensive.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches, so cantaloupes cannot be the cheapest.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the order:\n\n1. The cheapest fruit must be oranges because loquats are the second-cheapest, and peaches are more expensive than oranges.\n2. The second-cheapest fruit is loquats.\n3. The third-most expensive fruit is kiwis.\n4. The fourth-most expensive fruit is peaches.\n5. The most expensive fruit is cantaloupes.\n\nTherefore, the order from cheapest to most expensive is: Oranges, Loquats, Kiwis, Peaches, Cantaloupes.\n\nThe correct answer is that the oranges are the cheapest.\n\n<<<A>>>"
