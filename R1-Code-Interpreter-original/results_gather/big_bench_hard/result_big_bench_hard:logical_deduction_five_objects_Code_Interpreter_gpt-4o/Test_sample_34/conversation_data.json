    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Eve finished first.\n2. Rob finished above Mya.\n3. Joe finished above Eli.\n4. Joe finished below Mya.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n- Since Eve finished first, the order starts with Eve.\n- Rob finished above Mya, so Rob must be before Mya in the order.\n- Joe finished above Eli, so Joe must be before Eli in the order.\n- Joe finished below Mya, so Mya must be before Joe in the order.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to construct the order:\n\n1. Eve\n2. Rob (since Rob must be above Mya and Joe)\n3. Mya (since Mya must be above Joe)\n4. Joe (since Joe must be above Eli)\n5. Eli\n\nNow, let's check who finished second-to-last:\n\n- The order is: Eve, Rob, Mya, Joe, Eli.\n- Joe is in the fourth position, which is second-to-last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
