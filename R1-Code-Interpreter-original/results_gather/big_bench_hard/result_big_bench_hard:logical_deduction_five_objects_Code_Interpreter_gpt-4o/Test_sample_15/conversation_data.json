The white book is to the left of the red book.\n3. The black book is to the right of the red book.\n4. The black book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 3, the order is: Red, Black.\n- From condition 4, the order is: Black, Gray.\n- From condition 2, the order is: White, Red.\n- From condition 1, the order is: Gray, Yellow.\n\nCombining these conditions, we can deduce the order of the books:\n\n- The white book must be to the left of the red book, which is to the left of the black book.\n- The black book is to the left of the gray book, which is to the left of the yellow book.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: White, Red, Black, Gray, Yellow.\n\nTherefore, the yellow book is the rightmost.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
