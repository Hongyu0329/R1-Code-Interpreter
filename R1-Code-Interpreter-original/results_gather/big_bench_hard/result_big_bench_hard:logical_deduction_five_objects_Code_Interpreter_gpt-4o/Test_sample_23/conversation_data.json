The hatchback is newer than the motorcycle.\n3. The motorcycle is newer than the sedan.\n4. The hatchback is older than the truck.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since the sedan is the second-oldest, there must be one vehicle older than the sedan.\n- The motorcycle is newer than the sedan, so it cannot be the oldest.\n- The hatchback is newer than the motorcycle, so it is also newer than the sedan and cannot be the oldest.\n- The hatchback is older than the truck, so the truck cannot be the oldest.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only vehicle that can be the oldest is the bus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
