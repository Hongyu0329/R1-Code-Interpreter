    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the fruits in order of their prices from most expensive to least expensive based on the given statements:\n\n1. The oranges are the most expensive.\n2. The apples are the third-most expensive.\n3. The loquats are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\n4. The cantaloupes are less expensive than the apples.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits based on these statements:\n\n- Oranges are the most expensive.\n- Apples are the third-most expensive.\n- Since loquats are less expensive than cantaloupes, and cantaloupes are less expensive than apples, the order for these three must be: apples, cantaloupes, loquats.\n\nNow, let's place the peaches:\n\n- Oranges (most expensive)\n- [Peaches or Apples]\n- Apples (third-most expensive)\n- [Peaches or Cantaloupes]\n- [Peaches or Loquats]\n\nSince apples are the third-most expensive, peaches must be the second-most expensive to satisfy the condition that apples are third. This leaves:\n\n1. Oranges\n2. Peaches\n3. Apples\n4. Cantaloupes\n5. Loquats\n\nFrom this order, the second-cheapest fruit is the cantaloupes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
