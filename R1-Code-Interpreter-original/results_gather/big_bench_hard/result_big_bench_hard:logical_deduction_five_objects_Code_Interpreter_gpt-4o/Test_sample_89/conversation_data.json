    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The orange book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The green book is the rightmost.\n3. The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n4. The orange book is the third from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the orange book is the third from the left, the order starts with two books, then the orange book, followed by two more books.\n- The green book is the rightmost, so it must be the fifth book.\n- The orange book is to the right of the yellow book, and the yellow book is to the right of the blue book. This means the order of these three books is: blue, yellow, orange.\n\nNow, let's place these books in order:\n\n1. Blue book\n2. Yellow book\n3. Orange book\n4. Brown book (since the green book is the rightmost, the brown book must be the fourth)\n5. Green book\n\nNow, we can see that the second book from the left is the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
