    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price based on the given information:\n\n1. The pears are the second-cheapest.\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the pears.\n3. The plums are the second-most expensive.\n4. The watermelons are the most expensive.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce the order:\n\n- Cheapest: Apples (since pears are the second-cheapest)\n- Second-cheapest: Pears\n- Third-cheapest: Loquats (since they are more expensive than pears)\n- Second-most expensive: Plums\n- Most expensive: Watermelons\n\nThus, the loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\nThe correct option is (B) The loquats are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<B>>>"
