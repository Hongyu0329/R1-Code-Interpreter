    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished above Dan.\n3. Joe finished below Dan.\n4. Ada finished second.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know Ada is in the second position. Let's denote the positions as follows:\n\n1. ___\n2. Ada\n3. ___\n4. ___\n5. ___\n\nNow, let's use the other conditions to fill in the positions:\n\n- From condition 1, Mel must be below Ada, so Mel cannot be in the first position.\n- From condition 2, Mel is above Dan, so Dan cannot be in the third position.\n- From condition 3, Joe is below Dan, so Joe cannot be in the third position.\n\nSince Ada is second, and Mel is above Dan, Mel can be in the third position. This satisfies all conditions:\n\n1. Rob\n2. Ada\n3. Mel\n4. Dan\n5. Joe\n\nTherefore, Mel finished third.\n\nThe correct answer is (E) Mel finished third.\n\n<<<E>>>"
