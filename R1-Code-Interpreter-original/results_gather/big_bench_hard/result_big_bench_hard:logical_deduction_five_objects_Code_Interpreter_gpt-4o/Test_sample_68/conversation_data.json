    "\nassistant > To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n1. The sedan is the second-newest.\n2. The station wagon is newer than the convertible.\n3. The sedan is older than the motorcycle.\n4. The bus is the oldest.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that the bus is the oldest, which directly matches option (D).\n\nLet's verify the consistency of this arrangement with the other statements:\n\n- Since the bus is the oldest, it cannot be the second-newest, so the sedan being the second-newest is consistent.\n- The station wagon being newer than the convertible is consistent with the bus being the oldest.\n- The sedan being older than the motorcycle is consistent with the bus being the oldest.\n\nAll statements are consistent with the bus being the oldest. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
