    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. The robin is to the right of the cardinal.\n2. The cardinal is to the right of the blue jay.\n3. The blue jay is the second from the left.\n4. The crow is the rightmost.\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n\n- Since the blue jay is the second from the left, the possible positions for the blue jay are 2nd.\n- The cardinal is to the right of the blue jay, so the cardinal can be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.\n- The robin is to the right of the cardinal, so the robin can be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The crow is the rightmost, so the crow is in the 5th position.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the positions:\n\n1. The blue jay is in the 2nd position.\n2. The cardinal must be in the 3rd position (since the robin must be to the right of the cardinal).\n3. The robin must be in the 4th position.\n4. The crow is in the 5th position.\n5. The only remaining position (1st) is for the falcon.\n\nThus, the order from left to right is: Falcon, Blue Jay, Cardinal, Robin, Crow.\n\nThe rightmost bird is the crow.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The crow is the rightmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"
