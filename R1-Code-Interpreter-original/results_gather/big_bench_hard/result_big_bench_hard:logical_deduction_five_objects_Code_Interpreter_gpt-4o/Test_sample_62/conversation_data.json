    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The white book is to the left of the yellow book.\n3. The blue book is the second from the right.\n4. The purple book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the blue book is second from the right, the possible positions for the blue book are 4th.\n- The purple book is second from the left, so it is in the 2nd position.\n- The blue book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- The white book is to the left of the yellow book, so the white book cannot be in the 4th or 5th position.\n\nLet's arrange the books:\n\n1. The blue book is in the 4th position.\n2. The purple book is in the 2nd position.\n3. The yellow book must be in the 3rd position because it is to the left of the blue book and to the right of the white book.\n4. The white book must be in the 1st position because it is to the left of the yellow book.\n5. The green book is the only one left, so it must be in the 5th position.\n\nThe order of the books is: White, Purple, Yellow, Blue, Green.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is third from the left:\n\n- The third book from the left is the Yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
