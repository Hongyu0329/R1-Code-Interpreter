    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Apples are the third-most expensive.\n4. Pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since apples are the third-most expensive, there are two fruits more expensive than apples.\n- Apples > Oranges > Mangoes implies that mangoes are the least expensive.\n- Pears > Watermelons implies that watermelons are not the most expensive.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the order:\n\n1. The most expensive fruit cannot be apples, oranges, or watermelons.\n2. Since apples are third, and oranges are less expensive than apples, oranges cannot be the most expensive.\n3. Therefore, pears must be the most expensive.\n\nThus, the order from most expensive to least expensive is: Pears, (another fruit), Apples, Oranges, Mangoes.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
