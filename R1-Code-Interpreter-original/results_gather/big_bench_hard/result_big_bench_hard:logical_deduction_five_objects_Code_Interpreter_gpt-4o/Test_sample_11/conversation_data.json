    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. Peaches are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches.\n3. Kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n4. Loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since loquats are the second-cheapest, they cannot be the most expensive.\n- Kiwis are the third-most expensive, so they cannot be the most expensive.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches, so peaches cannot be the most expensive.\n- Peaches are more expensive than oranges, so oranges cannot be the most expensive.\n\nThis leaves cantaloupes as the only option for the most expensive fruit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
