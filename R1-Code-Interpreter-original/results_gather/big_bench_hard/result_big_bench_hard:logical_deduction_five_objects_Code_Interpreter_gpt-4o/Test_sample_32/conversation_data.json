    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Rob finished above Mel.\n2. Mel finished second.\n3. Ana finished above Eli.\n4. Dan finished last.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know Mel is in the second position. \n\nSince Dan finished last, the order from last to first is: Dan, ?, ?, Mel, ?.\n\nFrom statement 1, Rob must be in a position above Mel, so Rob cannot be in the third or fourth position. Therefore, Rob must be in the first position.\n\nThe order now is: Dan, ?, ?, Mel, Rob.\n\nFrom statement 3, Ana finished above Eli. The only positions left for Ana and Eli are third and fourth. Therefore, Ana must be in the third position, and Eli in the fourth position.\n\nThe final order is: Dan, Eli, Ana, Mel, Rob.\n\nThus, Eli finished second-to-last.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Eli finished second-to-last.\n\n<<<D>>>"
