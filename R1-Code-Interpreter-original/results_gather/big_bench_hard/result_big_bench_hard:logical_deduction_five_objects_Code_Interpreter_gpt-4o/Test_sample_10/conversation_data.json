    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n2. The pears are more expensive than the peaches.\n3. The apples are more expensive than the loquats.\n4. The apples are less expensive than the peaches.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 1, we have: Kiwis < Loquats\n- From statement 2, we have: Peaches < Pears\n- From statement 3, we have: Loquats < Apples\n- From statement 4, we have: Apples < Peaches\n\nCombining these inequalities, we get:\n\n- Kiwis < Loquats < Apples < Peaches < Pears\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-cheapest:\n\n- The order from cheapest to most expensive is: Kiwis, Loquats, Apples, Peaches, Pears\n\nTherefore, the second-cheapest fruit is the loquats.\n\nThe correct option is (D) The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<D>>>"
