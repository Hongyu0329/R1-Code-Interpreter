    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. The hawk is to the right of the owl.\n2. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n3. The crow is the second from the right.\n4. The robin is the second from the left.\n\nLet's denote the positions from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n- From condition 4, the robin is in position 2.\n- From condition 3, the crow is in position 4.\n- From condition 1, the hawk must be to the right of the owl.\n- From condition 2, the hummingbird must be to the right of the hawk.\n\nLet's place the birds in the positions:\n\n1. Owl\n2. Robin\n3. Hawk\n4. Crow\n5. Hummingbird\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The hawk is to the right of the owl: True (position 3 is to the right of position 1).\n- The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk: True (position 5 is to the right of position 3).\n- The crow is the second from the right: True (position 4 is second from the right).\n- The robin is the second from the left: True (position 2 is second from the left).\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all conditions. Now, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The owl is the second from the left: False (the owl is in position 1).\n(B) The hummingbird is the second from the left: False (the hummingbird is in position 5).\n(C) The crow is the second from the left: False (the crow is in position 4).\n(D) The hawk is the second from the left: False (the hawk is in position 3).\n(E) The robin is the second from the left: True (the robin is in position 2).\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
