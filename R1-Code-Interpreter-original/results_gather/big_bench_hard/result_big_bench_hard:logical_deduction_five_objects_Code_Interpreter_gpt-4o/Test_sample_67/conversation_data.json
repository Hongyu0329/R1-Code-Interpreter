    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's arrange the birds based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The owl is the second from the right.\n2. The robin is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n\nLet's denote the positions from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n- From condition 1, the owl is in position 4.\n- From condition 2, the robin is in position 2.\n- From condition 3, the blue jay must be in position 1 (since the robin is in position 2 and is to the right of the blue jay).\n- From condition 4, the hummingbird must be in position 5 and the hawk in position 3 (since the hummingbird is to the right of the hawk).\n\nThus, the arrangement from left to right is: Blue Jay, Robin, Hawk, Owl, Hummingbird.\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is the second from the right:\n\n- Position 4 (second from the right) is occupied by the Owl.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The owl is the second from the right.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
