    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the left of the green book.\n2. The gray book is the second from the right.\n3. The yellow book is to the right of the orange book.\n4. The blue book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the gray book is the second from the right, the order from the rightmost position is: [_, _, gray, _, _].\n- The blue book is the second from the left, so the order from the leftmost position is: [_, blue, _, _, _].\n- The gray book is to the left of the green book, so the green book cannot be in the position immediately to the left of the gray book.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the orange book.\n\nLet's fill in the positions step by step:\n\n1. The gray book is second from the right: [_, _, gray, _, _].\n2. The blue book is second from the left: [_, blue, _, gray, _].\n3. The gray book is to the left of the green book, so the green book must be the rightmost: [_, blue, _, gray, green].\n4. The yellow book is to the right of the orange book, so the orange book must be the leftmost: [orange, blue, yellow, gray, green].\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The yellow book is the leftmost - Incorrect\n(B) The green book is the leftmost - Incorrect\n(C) The gray book is the leftmost - Incorrect\n(D) The blue book is the leftmost - Incorrect\n(E) The orange book is the leftmost - Correct\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
