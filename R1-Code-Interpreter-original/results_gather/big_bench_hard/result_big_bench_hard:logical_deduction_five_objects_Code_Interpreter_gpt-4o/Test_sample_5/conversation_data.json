    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the right of the orange book.\n2. The green book is the second from the right.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the green book is the second from the right, the possible positions for the green book are the fourth position.\n- The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so the orange book cannot be in the last position.\n- The brown book is to the right of the white book, so the white book cannot be in the last position.\n- The brown book is to the left of the orange book, so the brown book cannot be in the last position.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. The green book is in the fourth position.\n2. The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so the gray book is in the fifth position, and the orange book is in the third position.\n3. The brown book is to the left of the orange book, so the brown book is in the second position.\n4. The white book is in the first position.\n\nThe order of the books is: White, Brown, Orange, Green, Gray.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is third from the left:\n\n- The third book from the left is the Orange book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The orange book is the third from the left.\n\n<<<E>>>"
