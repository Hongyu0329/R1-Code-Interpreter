    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue book is the leftmost.\n2. The red book is the third from the left.\n3. The white book is to the right of the gray book.\n4. The red book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nLet's arrange the books step by step:\n\n- Since the blue book is the leftmost, it is in the first position.\n- The red book is the third from the left, so it is in the third position.\n- The red book is to the left of the gray book, so the gray book cannot be in the second position. It must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n- The white book is to the right of the gray book, so the white book must be in the fifth position if the gray book is in the fourth position.\n\nLet's place the books:\n\n1. Blue book\n2. Purple book (since it is the only one left for this position)\n3. Red book\n4. Gray book\n5. White book\n\nNow, let's check the options for the second from the right, which is the fourth position:\n\n- The gray book is in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
