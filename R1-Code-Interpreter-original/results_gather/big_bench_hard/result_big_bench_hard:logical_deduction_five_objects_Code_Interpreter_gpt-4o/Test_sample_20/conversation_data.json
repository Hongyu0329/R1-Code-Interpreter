    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Mangoes are less expensive than pears.\n3. Apples are the second-cheapest.\n4. Watermelons are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- From statement 3, we know that apples are the second-cheapest.\n- From statement 1, watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, so cantaloupes are cheaper than watermelons.\n- From statement 4, watermelons are less expensive than mangoes, so mangoes are more expensive than watermelons.\n- From statement 2, mangoes are less expensive than pears, so pears are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nGiven that apples are the second-cheapest, the only fruit that can be cheaper than apples is cantaloupes. Therefore, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Apples\n3. Watermelons\n4. Mangoes\n5. Pears\n\nThus, the apples are indeed the second-cheapest.\n\nThe correct option is (B) The apples are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<B>>>"
