The raven is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the left of the crow.\n4. The robin is the second from the right.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, the arrangement starts with one bird, then the raven.\n- The robin is the second from the right, so there is one bird to the right of the robin.\n- The raven is to the right of the owl, so the owl must be the leftmost bird.\n- The robin is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be the rightmost bird.\n\nGiven these conditions, the arrangement is:\n\n1. Owl\n2. Raven\n3. Cardinal\n4. Robin\n5. Crow\n\nTherefore, the owl is the leftmost bird.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
