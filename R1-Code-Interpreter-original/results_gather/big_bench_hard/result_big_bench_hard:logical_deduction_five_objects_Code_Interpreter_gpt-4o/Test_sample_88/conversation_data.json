    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Apples are the third-most expensive.\n4. Pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Since apples are the third-most expensive, there are two fruits more expensive than apples.\n- Apples > Oranges > Mangoes implies that oranges and mangoes are less expensive than apples.\n- Pears are more expensive than watermelons, so pears cannot be the least expensive.\n\nGiven that apples are the third-most expensive, the order from most to least expensive must be:\n\n1. Pears\n2. Oranges\n3. Apples\n4. Watermelons\n5. Mangoes\n\nThis order satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- Apples are more expensive than oranges and mangoes.\n- Oranges are more expensive than mangoes.\n- Pears are more expensive than watermelons.\n- Apples are the third-most expensive.\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the second-most expensive fruit is oranges.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The oranges are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<B>>>"
