    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to arrange the birds according to the given conditions:\n\n1. The quail is to the left of the blue jay.\n2. The cardinal is the third from the left.\n3. The quail is the second from the left.\n4. The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 3, we know that the quail is the second from the left.\n- From condition 2, the cardinal is the third from the left.\n- From condition 1, the quail is to the left of the blue jay, so the blue jay cannot be first or second. Since the quail is second, the blue jay must be fourth or fifth.\n- From condition 4, the blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird, so the blue jay cannot be fifth. Therefore, the blue jay must be fourth, and the hummingbird must be fifth.\n\nNow, we can arrange the birds as follows:\n\n1. Unknown\n2. Quail\n3. Cardinal\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n\nThe only bird left is the hawk, which must be first.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n\n1. Hawk\n2. Quail\n3. Cardinal\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n\nThe correct option is (E) The quail is the second from the left.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
