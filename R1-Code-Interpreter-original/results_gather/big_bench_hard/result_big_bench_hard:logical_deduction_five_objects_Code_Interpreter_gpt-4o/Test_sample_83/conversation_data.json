    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements:\n\n1. Joe finished second.\n2. Joe finished below Amy.\n3. Mel finished second-to-last.\n4. Ada finished last.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Joe finished second, the order must be: [1st, Joe, 3rd, Mel, Ada].\n- Joe finished below Amy, so Amy must be 1st.\n- Mel finished second-to-last, so Mel is 4th.\n- Ada finished last, so Ada is 5th.\n\nThus, the order is: Amy, Joe, Rob, Mel, Ada.\n\nJoe is indeed second, which matches option (D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
