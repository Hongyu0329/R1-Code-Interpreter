    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints:\n\n1. Mangoes are more expensive than loquats.\n2. Cantaloupes are more expensive than mangoes.\n3. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n4. Pears are the cheapest.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since pears are the cheapest, they must be first.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than loquats, so loquats must be cheaper than mangoes.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than mangoes, so they must come after mangoes.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, so they must be the most expensive.\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n\n1. Pears\n2. Loquats\n3. Mangoes\n4. Cantaloupes\n5. Watermelons\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the second-cheapest fruit is loquats.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<E>>>"
