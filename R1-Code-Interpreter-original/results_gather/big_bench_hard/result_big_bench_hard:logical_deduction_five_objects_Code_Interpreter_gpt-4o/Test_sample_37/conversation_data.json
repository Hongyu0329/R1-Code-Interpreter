The black book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The orange book is to the left of the purple book.\n4. The black book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it must be in the 5th position.\n- The black book is the second from the left, so it is in the 2nd position.\n- The orange book must be to the right of the black book and to the left of the purple book.\n- The only positions left for the orange and purple books are the 3rd and 4th positions.\n- Therefore, the orange book is in the 3rd position, and the purple book is in the 4th position.\n- The only book left is the red book, which must be in the 1st position.\n\nThe order of the books from left to right is: Red, Black, Orange, Purple, Yellow.\n\nNow, let's determine which book is the second from the right:\n\n- The second from the right is the 4th position, which is occupied by the purple book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
