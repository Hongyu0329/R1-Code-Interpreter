    "To determine the total number of objects, we need to carefully count each item listed in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Oven**: There is 1 oven.\n2. **Chair**: There is 1 chair.\n3. **Toasters**: There are 2 toasters.\n4. **Table**: There is 1 table.\n5. **Microwaves**: There are 2 microwaves.\n6. **Lamp**: There is 1 lamp.\n7. **Couch**: There is 1 couch.\n8. **Beds**: There are 2 beds.\n9. **Fridge**: There is 1 fridge.\n\nNow, let's add up all these objects:\n\n- 1 (oven) \n- + 1 (chair) \n- + 2 (toasters) \n- + 1 (table) \n- + 2 (microwaves) \n- + 1 (lamp) \n- + 1 (couch) \n- + 2 (beds) \n- + 1 (fridge)\n\nAdding these numbers together:\n\n1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12\n\nTherefore, the total number of objects is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
