    "To determine the number of fruits you have, let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the items listed**: The question mentions three items: an orange, an apple, and a blackberry.\n\n2. **Determine if each item is a fruit**:\n   - An orange is a fruit.\n   - An apple is a fruit.\n   - A blackberry is a fruit.\n\n3. **Count the number of fruits**: Since all three items listed are fruits, we need to count them:\n   - Orange: 1 fruit\n   - Apple: 1 fruit\n   - Blackberry: 1 fruit\n\n4. **Add the number of fruits**: \n   - Total number of fruits = 1 (orange) + 1 (apple) + 1 (blackberry) = 3 fruits\n\n5. **Verify the count**: Double-check that each item is indeed a fruit and that all items have been counted.\n\nAfter following these steps, we conclude that you have a total of three fruits.\n\n<<<3>>>"
