    "To determine how many fruits you have, we need to identify which items from your list are considered fruits. Let's go through the list step by step:\n\n1. **Blackberry** - This is a fruit.\n2. **Raspberry** - This is a fruit.\n3. **Peach** - This is a fruit.\n4. **Head of Broccoli** - This is a vegetable, not a fruit.\n5. **Plum** - This is a fruit.\n6. **Orange** - This is a fruit.\n7. **Two Bananas** - Bananas are fruits. Since you have two, they count as two fruits.\n8. **Grape** - This is a fruit.\n9. **Two Garlics** - Garlic is not a fruit; it is a vegetable.\n10. **Nectarine** - This is a fruit.\n11. **Lettuce Head** - This is a vegetable, not a fruit.\n12. **Apple** - This is a fruit.\n\nNow, let's count the fruits:\n\n- Blackberry: 1\n- Raspberry: 1\n- Peach: 1\n- Plum: 1\n- Orange: 1\n- Bananas: 2\n- Grape: 1\n- Nectarine: 1\n- Apple: 1\n\nAdding these up gives us:\n\n1 (Blackberry) + 1 (Raspberry) + 1 (Peach) + 1 (Plum) + 1 (Orange) + 2 (Bananas) + 1 (Grape) + 1 (Nectarine) + 1 (Apple) = 10 fruits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits you have is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
