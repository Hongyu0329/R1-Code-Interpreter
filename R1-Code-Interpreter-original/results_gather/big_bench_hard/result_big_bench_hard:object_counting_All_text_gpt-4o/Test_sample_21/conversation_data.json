    "To determine the total number of objects you have, we need to carefully list and count each item mentioned in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Stove**: 1 object\n2. **Bed**: 1 object\n3. **Lamp**: 1 object\n4. **Microwaves**: 3 objects (since you have three microwaves)\n5. **Chair**: 1 object\n6. **Toaster**: 1 object\n7. **Table**: 1 object\n8. **Cars**: 2 objects (since you have two cars)\n9. **Fridge**: 1 object\n10. **Oven**: 1 object\n\nNow, let's add up all these objects:\n\n- Stove: 1\n- Bed: 1\n- Lamp: 1\n- Microwaves: 3\n- Chair: 1\n- Toaster: 1\n- Table: 1\n- Cars: 2\n- Fridge: 1\n- Oven: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 13\n\nTherefore, the total number of objects you have is 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
