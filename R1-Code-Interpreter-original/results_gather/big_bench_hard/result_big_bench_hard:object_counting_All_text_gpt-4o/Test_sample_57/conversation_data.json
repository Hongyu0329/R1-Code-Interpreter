    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to carefully count each type of fruit listed in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Nectarines**: The question states that there are four nectarines.\n\n2. **Bananas**: The question states that there are three bananas.\n\n3. **Peach**: The question states that there is one peach.\n\n4. **Strawberry**: The question states that there is one strawberry.\n\n5. **Raspberry**: The question states that there is one raspberry.\n\n6. **Plum**: The question states that there is one plum.\n\n7. **Apple**: The question states that there is one apple.\n\n8. **Orange**: The question states that there is one orange.\n\nNow, let's add up all the fruits:\n\n- Nectarines: 4\n- Bananas: 3\n- Peach: 1\n- Strawberry: 1\n- Raspberry: 1\n- Plum: 1\n- Apple: 1\n- Orange: 1\n\nTotal number of fruits = 4 (nectarines) + 3 (bananas) + 1 (peach) + 1 (strawberry) + 1 (raspberry) + 1 (plum) + 1 (apple) + 1 (orange)\n\nTotal = 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits is 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
