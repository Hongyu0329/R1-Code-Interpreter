    "To determine the total number of animals you have, we need to carefully analyze the list of animals provided and count each one. Let's go through the list step by step:\n\n1. **Mouse**: You have one mouse.\n2. **Rabbit**: You have one rabbit.\n3. **Dog**: You have one dog.\n4. **Duck**: You have one duck.\n5. **Goats**: You have two goats.\n\nNow, let's add up the number of each type of animal to find the total number of animals:\n\n- 1 mouse\n- 1 rabbit\n- 1 dog\n- 1 duck\n- 2 goats\n\nAdding these together:\n\n1 (mouse) + 1 (rabbit) + 1 (dog) + 1 (duck) + 2 (goats) = 6 animals\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals you have is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
