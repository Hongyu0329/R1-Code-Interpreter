    "To determine how many fruits you have, we need to identify which items in your list are fruits. Let's analyze the list step by step:\n\n1. **Nectarine**: A nectarine is a type of fruit.  \n2. **Two toasters**: Toasters are kitchen appliances, not fruits.  \n3. **Orange**: An orange is a fruit.  \n4. **Four peaches**: Peaches are fruits. Since you have four of them, they count as four fruits.  \n5. **Apple**: An apple is a fruit.  \n6. **Strawberry**: A strawberry is a fruit.  \n7. **Plum**: A plum is a fruit.  \n\nNow, let's count the fruits:\n\n- 1 nectarine\n- 1 orange\n- 4 peaches\n- 1 apple\n- 1 strawberry\n- 1 plum\n\nAdd them up:  \n1 (nectarine) + 1 (orange) + 4 (peaches) + 1 (apple) + 1 (strawberry) + 1 (plum) = 9 fruits\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits you have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
