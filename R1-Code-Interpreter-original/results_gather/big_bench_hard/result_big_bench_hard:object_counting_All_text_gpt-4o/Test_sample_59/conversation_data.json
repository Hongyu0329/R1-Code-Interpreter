    "To determine the total number of objects you have, we need to carefully list and count each item mentioned in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Beds**: You have two beds. This counts as two objects.\n2. **Stove**: You have one stove. This counts as one object.\n3. **Microwave**: You have one microwave. This counts as one object.\n4. **Table**: You have one table. This counts as one object.\n5. **Fridge**: You have one fridge. This counts as one object.\n6. **Lamp**: You have one lamp. This counts as one object.\n7. **Toaster**: You have one toaster. This counts as one object.\n\nNow, let's add up all the objects:\n\n- Beds: 2\n- Stove: 1\n- Microwave: 1\n- Table: 1\n- Fridge: 1\n- Lamp: 1\n- Toaster: 1\n\nTotal number of objects = 2 (beds) + 1 (stove) + 1 (microwave) + 1 (table) + 1 (fridge) + 1 (lamp) + 1 (toaster) = 8\n\nTherefore, the total number of objects you have is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
