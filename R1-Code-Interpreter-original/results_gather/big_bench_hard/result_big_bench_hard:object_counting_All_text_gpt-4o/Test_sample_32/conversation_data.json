    "To determine the total number of objects, we need to carefully count each type of item listed in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Couches**: The question states that there are two couches. Therefore, we have 2 couches.\n\n2. **Toaster**: There is one toaster mentioned. Therefore, we have 1 toaster.\n\n3. **Chairs**: The question states that there are two chairs. Therefore, we have 2 chairs.\n\n4. **Microwaves**: The question states that there are four microwaves. Therefore, we have 4 microwaves.\n\n5. **Table**: There is one table mentioned. Therefore, we have 1 table.\n\n6. **Lamp**: There is one lamp mentioned. Therefore, we have 1 lamp.\n\nNow, we add up all the objects:\n\n- Couches: 2\n- Toaster: 1\n- Chairs: 2\n- Microwaves: 4\n- Table: 1\n- Lamp: 1\n\nTotal number of objects = 2 (couches) + 1 (toaster) + 2 (chairs) + 4 (microwaves) + 1 (table) + 1 (lamp) = 11\n\nTherefore, the total number of objects is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
