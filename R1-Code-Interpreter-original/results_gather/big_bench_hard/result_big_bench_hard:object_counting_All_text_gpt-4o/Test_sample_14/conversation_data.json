    "To determine the total number of musical instruments, we need to carefully count each type of instrument listed in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Trumpet**: There is 1 trumpet.\n2. **Clarinet**: There is 1 clarinet.\n3. **Trombones**: There are 2 trombones.\n4. **Flute**: There is 1 flute.\n5. **Violins**: There are 5 violins.\n6. **Piano**: There is 1 piano.\n\nNow, we add up all the instruments:\n\n- Trumpet: 1\n- Clarinet: 1\n- Trombones: 2\n- Flute: 1\n- Violins: 5\n- Piano: 1\n\nAdding these together:\n\n1 (trumpet) + 1 (clarinet) + 2 (trombones) + 1 (flute) + 5 (violins) + 1 (piano) = 11\n\nTherefore, the total number of musical instruments is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
