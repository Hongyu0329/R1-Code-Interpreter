    "To determine the total number of animals, we need to carefully count each type of animal listed in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Pig**: There is 1 pig.\n2. **Cow**: There is 1 cow.\n3. **Frogs**: There are 3 frogs.\n4. **Donkey**: There is 1 donkey.\n5. **Snake**: There is 1 snake.\n6. **Chicken**: There is 1 chicken.\n7. **Cat**: There is 1 cat.\n8. **Snail**: There is 1 snail.\n9. **Mice**: There are 4 mice.\n10. **Bears**: There are 3 bears.\n\nNow, let's add up all these numbers to find the total number of animals:\n\n- 1 pig\n- 1 cow\n- 3 frogs\n- 1 donkey\n- 1 snake\n- 1 chicken\n- 1 cat\n- 1 snail\n- 4 mice\n- 3 bears\n\nAdding these together:\n\n1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 17\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
