    "To determine the total number of objects, we need to carefully count each type of object mentioned in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Couches**: The question states that there are four couches. So, we have 4 couches.\n\n2. **Bed**: There is one bed mentioned. So, we have 1 bed.\n\n3. **Table**: There is one table mentioned. So, we have 1 table.\n\n4. **Lamp**: There is one lamp mentioned. So, we have 1 lamp.\n\nNow, we need to add up all these objects to find the total number of objects:\n\n- Number of couches = 4\n- Number of beds = 1\n- Number of tables = 1\n- Number of lamps = 1\n\nTotal number of objects = 4 (couches) + 1 (bed) + 1 (table) + 1 (lamp)\n\nLet's calculate the total:\n\n4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7\n\nTherefore, the total number of objects is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
