    "To determine how many vegetables you have, we need to analyze the list of items you provided and identify which of them are considered vegetables. Let's go through each item step by step:\n\n1. **Yam**: A yam is a type of tuber and is generally considered a vegetable.\n\n2. **Cauliflower**: Cauliflower is a cruciferous vegetable.\n\n3. **Garlic**: Garlic is a bulb and is considered a vegetable.\n\n4. **Two Lettuce Heads**: Lettuce is a leafy green vegetable. Since you have two heads of lettuce, this counts as two vegetables.\n\n5. **Head of Broccoli**: Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable.\n\n6. **Potato**: A potato is a tuber and is considered a vegetable.\n\n7. **Stalk of Celery**: Celery is a stalk vegetable.\n\n8. **Onion**: An onion is a bulb and is considered a vegetable.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of vegetables:\n\n- Yam: 1\n- Cauliflower: 1\n- Garlic: 1\n- Lettuce Heads: 2\n- Broccoli: 1\n- Potato: 1\n- Celery: 1\n- Onion: 1\n\nAdding these up gives us:\n\n1 (Yam) + 1 (Cauliflower) + 1 (Garlic) + 2 (Lettuce Heads) + 1 (Broccoli) + 1 (Potato) + 1 (Celery) + 1 (Onion) = 9\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 9 vegetables.\n\n<<<9>>>"
