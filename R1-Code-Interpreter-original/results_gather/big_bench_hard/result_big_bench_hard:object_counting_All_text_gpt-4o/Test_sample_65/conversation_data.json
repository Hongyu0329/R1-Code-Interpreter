    "To determine the total number of animals, we need to carefully count each type of animal mentioned in the statement. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Cow**: The statement mentions \"a cow,\" which means there is 1 cow.\n\n2. **Mice**: The statement mentions \"three mice,\" which means there are 3 mice.\n\n3. **Dog**: The statement mentions \"a dog,\" which means there is 1 dog.\n\n4. **Duck**: The statement mentions \"a duck,\" which means there is 1 duck.\n\n5. **Snakes**: The statement mentions \"two snakes,\" which means there are 2 snakes.\n\nNow, let's add up all the animals:\n\n- 1 cow\n- 3 mice\n- 1 dog\n- 1 duck\n- 2 snakes\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n\n1 (cow) + 3 (mice) + 1 (dog) + 1 (duck) + 2 (snakes) = 8 animals\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
