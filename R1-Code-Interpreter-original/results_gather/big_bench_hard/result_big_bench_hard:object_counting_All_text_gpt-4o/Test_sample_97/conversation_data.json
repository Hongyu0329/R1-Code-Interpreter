    "To determine the total number of objects, we need to carefully list and count each item mentioned in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Fridges**: The question states that there are two fridges.\n2. **Table**: There is one table.\n3. **Toaster**: There is one toaster.\n4. **Chair**: There is one chair.\n5. **Bed**: There is one bed.\n6. **Oven**: There is one oven.\n7. **Couch**: There is one couch.\n8. **Car**: There is one car.\n9. **Microwaves**: The question states that there are four microwaves.\n10. **Stove**: There is one stove.\n\nNow, let's add up all these items:\n\n- Fridges: 2\n- Table: 1\n- Toaster: 1\n- Chair: 1\n- Bed: 1\n- Oven: 1\n- Couch: 1\n- Car: 1\n- Microwaves: 4\n- Stove: 1\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n\n2 (fridges) + 1 (table) + 1 (toaster) + 1 (chair) + 1 (bed) + 1 (oven) + 1 (couch) + 1 (car) + 4 (microwaves) + 1 (stove) = 14\n\nTherefore, the total number of objects is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
