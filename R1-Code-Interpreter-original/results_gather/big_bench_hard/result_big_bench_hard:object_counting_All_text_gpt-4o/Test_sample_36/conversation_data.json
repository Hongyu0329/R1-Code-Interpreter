    "To determine the total number of objects you have, we need to carefully list and count each item mentioned in the question. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify each object mentioned:**\n   - Bed\n   - Fridge\n   - Lamp\n   - Toaster\n   - Chairs (four of them)\n   - Table\n\n2. **Count each type of object:**\n   - Bed: 1\n   - Fridge: 1\n   - Lamp: 1\n   - Toaster: 1\n   - Chairs: 4\n   - Table: 1\n\n3. **Add up the total number of objects:**\n   - 1 (bed) + 1 (fridge) + 1 (lamp) + 1 (toaster) + 4 (chairs) + 1 (table) = 9\n\n4. **Verify the count:**\n   - Ensure that each object is counted correctly and that no object is missed or double-counted.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the total number of objects.\n\n<<<9>>>"
