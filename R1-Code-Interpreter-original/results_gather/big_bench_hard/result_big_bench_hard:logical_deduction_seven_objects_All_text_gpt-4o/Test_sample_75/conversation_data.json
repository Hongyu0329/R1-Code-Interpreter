    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds on the branch according to the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The hummingbird is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the hummingbird is in position 2.\n\n2. **The raven is the fourth from the left.**\n   - This places the raven in position 4.\n\n3. **The raven is to the right of the hawk.**\n   - This means the hawk must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\n4. **The owl is to the right of the crow.**\n   - This means the crow must be in a position to the left of the owl.\n\n5. **The falcon is the rightmost.**\n   - This places the falcon in position 7.\n\n6. **The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird.**\n   - Since the hummingbird is in position 2, the hawk must be in position 3.\n\n7. **The quail is the second from the right.**\n   - This places the quail in position 6.\n\nNow, let's place the birds according to these conditions:\n\n- Position 1: The only bird left that can be placed here is the crow, as the owl must be to the right of the crow.\n- Position 2: Hummingbird (given).\n- Position 3: Hawk (since it must be to the right of the hummingbird and to the left of the raven).\n- Position 4: Raven (given).\n- Position 5: The only bird left that can be placed here is the owl, as it must be to the right of the crow.\n- Position 6: Quail (given).\n- Position 7: Falcon (given).\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1. Crow\n2. Hummingbird\n3. Hawk\n4. Raven\n5. Owl\n6. Quail\n7. Falcon\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is third from the right:\n- The third from the right is position 5, which is occupied by the owl.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<C>>>"
