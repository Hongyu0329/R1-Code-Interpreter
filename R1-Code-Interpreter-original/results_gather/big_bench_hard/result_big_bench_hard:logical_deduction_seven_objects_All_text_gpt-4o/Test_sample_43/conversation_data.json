    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the seven birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The crow is the rightmost.**  \n   This directly tells us that the crow is in the 7th position.\n\n2. **The owl is the third from the right.**  \n   Since the crow is the 7th, the owl must be in the 5th position.\n\n3. **The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.**  \n   This places the hummingbird in the 4th position.\n\n4. **The robin is to the left of the owl.**  \n   Since the owl is in the 5th position, the robin must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, the hummingbird is already in the 4th position, so the robin must be in one of the first three positions.\n\n5. **The blue jay is to the left of the robin.**  \n   This means the blue jay must be in a position to the left of the robin. Therefore, if the robin is in position 3, the blue jay must be in position 1 or 2. If the robin is in position 2, the blue jay must be in position 1.\n\n6. **The raven is the second from the left.**  \n   This places the raven in the 2nd position.\n\nNow, let's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n- The raven is in the 2nd position.\n- The hummingbird is in the 4th position.\n- The owl is in the 5th position.\n- The crow is in the 7th position.\n\nGiven these placements, let's determine the positions of the robin and the blue jay:\n\n- The robin must be to the left of the owl, so it can be in position 1 or 3.\n- The blue jay must be to the left of the robin.\n\nSince the raven is in position 2, the robin cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the robin must be in position 3, and the blue jay must be in position 1.\n\nFinally, the only bird left is the falcon, which must be in position 6.\n\nThe final order from left to right is:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Raven\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Owl\n6. Falcon\n7. Crow\n\nThe question asks which bird is the rightmost. According to our arrangement, the crow is the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
