    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds on the branch according to the given conditions and determine which bird is the rightmost.\n\n1. **Identify the birds and their positions:**\n   - Birds: raven, hummingbird, robin, crow, quail, blue jay, cardinal.\n\n2. **Apply the conditions:**\n   - \"The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.\"\n   - \"The quail is to the right of the crow.\"\n   - \"The raven is to the left of the robin.\"\n   - \"The blue jay is the third from the right.\"\n   - \"The cardinal is the leftmost.\"\n   - \"The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\"\n\n3. **Start placing the birds based on the conditions:**\n   - The cardinal is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n   - The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n   - The blue jay is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n\n4. **Determine the remaining positions:**\n   - Positions 2, 3, 6, and 7 are left to be filled by the raven, robin, crow, and quail.\n\n5. **Apply the remaining conditions:**\n   - \"The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.\" Since the hummingbird is in position 4, the crow must be in position 6 or 7.\n   - \"The quail is to the right of the crow.\" This means the quail must be in position 7 if the crow is in position 6.\n   - \"The raven is to the left of the robin.\" This means the raven must be in position 2 and the robin in position 3.\n\n6. **Fill in the positions:**\n   - Position 1: Cardinal\n   - Position 2: Raven\n   - Position 3: Robin\n   - Position 4: Hummingbird\n   - Position 5: Blue Jay\n   - Position 6: Crow\n   - Position 7: Quail\n\n7. **Determine the rightmost bird:**\n   - The rightmost position, position 7, is occupied by the quail.\n\nTherefore, the rightmost bird is the quail.\n\n<<<E>>>"
