    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven fruits based on their prices, using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means watermelons are not the cheapest and are priced higher than cantaloupes.\n\n2. **The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means apples are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n\n3. **The watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This places watermelons in the second position from the top in terms of price.\n\n4. **The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - This means loquats are cheaper than kiwis.\n\n5. **The apples are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - This places apples above loquats in terms of price.\n\n6. **The loquats are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This places loquats in the third position from the bottom in terms of price.\n\n7. **The plums are the cheapest.**\n   - This places plums in the first position from the bottom in terms of price.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these statements:\n\n- **Cheapest (1st):** Plums\n- **2nd Cheapest:** Unknown\n- **3rd Cheapest:** Loquats (from statement 6)\n- **4th Cheapest:** Apples (since apples are more expensive than loquats but less expensive than cantaloupes)\n- **5th Cheapest:** Kiwis (since loquats are cheaper than kiwis)\n- **6th Cheapest:** Cantaloupes (since watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes and apples are less expensive than cantaloupes)\n- **Most Expensive (7th):** Watermelons (since they are the second-most expensive, and we have accounted for all other positions)\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which fruit is the third-cheapest:\n\n- (A) The plums are the third-cheapest\n- (B) The kiwis are the third-cheapest\n- (C) The cantaloupes are the third-cheapest\n- (D) The pears are the third-cheapest\n- (E) The watermelons are the third-cheapest\n- (F) The apples are the third-cheapest\n- (G) The loquats are the third-cheapest\n\nFrom our arrangement, the loquats are indeed the third-cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
