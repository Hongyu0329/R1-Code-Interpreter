    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **The motorcyle is older than the tractor.**\n   - This means the motorcyle is not the newest, and the tractor is not the oldest.\n\n2. **The hatchback is older than the limousine.**\n   - The hatchback is not the newest, and the limousine is not the oldest.\n\n3. **The hatchback is newer than the truck.**\n   - The truck is older than the hatchback.\n\n4. **The truck is newer than the tractor.**\n   - The tractor is older than the truck.\n\n5. **The minivan is the second-newest.**\n   - This fixes the position of the minivan as the second-newest.\n\n6. **The sedan is the third-newest.**\n   - This fixes the position of the sedan as the third-newest.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these conditions:\n\n- **Newest to Oldest:**\n  1. Newest: Unknown\n  2. Second-newest: Minivan\n  3. Third-newest: Sedan\n  4. Unknown\n  5. Unknown\n  6. Unknown\n  7. Oldest: Unknown\n\nFrom the conditions, we know:\n- The motorcyle is older than the tractor.\n- The hatchback is older than the limousine and newer than the truck.\n- The truck is newer than the tractor.\n\nLet's deduce the order:\n\n- Since the minivan and sedan are fixed as second and third newest, the newest vehicle must be either the limousine or the hatchback.\n- The hatchback is newer than the truck, so the truck cannot be the newest.\n- The limousine is newer than the hatchback, so the limousine is the newest.\n- The hatchback is newer than the truck, so the hatchback is the fourth-newest.\n- The truck is newer than the tractor, so the truck is the fifth-newest.\n- The motorcyle is older than the tractor, so the motorcyle is the sixth-newest.\n- The tractor is the oldest.\n\nThus, the order from newest to oldest is:\n1. Limousine\n2. Minivan\n3. Sedan\n4. Hatchback\n5. Truck\n6. Motorcyle\n7. Tractor\n\nNow, we need to find the third-oldest vehicle:\n- From the oldest: Tractor (7th), Motorcyle (6th), Truck (5th), Hatchback (4th), Sedan (3rd), Minivan (2nd), Limousine (1st).\n\nThe third-oldest vehicle is the Truck.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
