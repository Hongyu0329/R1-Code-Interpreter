    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on the shelf according to the given conditions and determine which book is fourth from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the books and their positions:**\n   - Books: Red, Purple, Green, White, Orange, Blue, Gray.\n\n2. **Apply the conditions:**\n   - The green book is to the left of the white book.\n   - The red book is to the left of the purple book.\n   - The red book is to the right of the orange book.\n   - The gray book is the second from the left.\n   - The purple book is to the left of the green book.\n   - The blue book is the fourth from the left.\n\n3. **Start placing the books:**\n   - Place the gray book second from the left: _ Gray _ _ _ _ _\n   - Place the blue book fourth from the left: _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n\n4. **Determine the positions of the remaining books:**\n   - The red book is to the right of the orange book, so Orange must be to the left of Red.\n   - The red book is to the left of the purple book, so Red must be to the left of Purple.\n   - The purple book is to the left of the green book, so Purple must be to the left of Green.\n   - The green book is to the left of the white book, so Green must be to the left of White.\n\n5. **Arrange the books based on the above conditions:**\n   - Since Gray is second and Blue is fourth, the possible positions for Orange, Red, Purple, Green, and White are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - Orange must be first because Red is to the right of Orange.\n   - Red must be third because it is to the left of Purple and to the right of Orange.\n   - Purple must be fifth because it is to the left of Green.\n   - Green must be sixth because it is to the left of White.\n   - White must be seventh.\n\n6. **Final arrangement:**\n   - 1: Orange\n   - 2: Gray\n   - 3: Red\n   - 4: Blue\n   - 5: Purple\n   - 6: Green\n   - 7: White\n\nThe book that is fourth from the left is the Blue book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<F>>>."
