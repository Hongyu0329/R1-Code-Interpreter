    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The falcon is to the left of the crow.**\n   - This means the falcon must be placed somewhere before the crow in the sequence.\n\n2. **The quail is to the right of the cardinal.**\n   - This means the quail must be placed somewhere after the cardinal in the sequence.\n\n3. **The hummingbird is to the right of the quail.**\n   - This means the hummingbird must be placed somewhere after the quail in the sequence.\n\n4. **The falcon is the second from the right.**\n   - This gives us a specific position for the falcon: it is the sixth bird in the sequence.\n\n5. **The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk.**\n   - This means the hummingbird must be placed somewhere before the hawk in the sequence.\n\n6. **The owl is the third from the left.**\n   - This gives us a specific position for the owl: it is the third bird in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order of the birds:\n\n- Since the falcon is the second from the right, it occupies the sixth position.\n- The owl is the third from the left, so it occupies the third position.\n- The falcon is to the left of the crow, so the crow cannot be in the sixth position. The crow must be in the seventh position.\n- The quail is to the right of the cardinal, and the hummingbird is to the right of the quail. Therefore, the cardinal must be placed before both the quail and the hummingbird.\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk, so the hawk must be in the last position (seventh), and the hummingbird must be before it.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the birds:\n\n1. **First position:** Cardinal (since it must be before the quail and hummingbird)\n2. **Second position:** Quail (since it must be before the hummingbird)\n3. **Third position:** Owl (given)\n4. **Fourth position:** Hummingbird (since it must be before the hawk)\n5. **Fifth position:** Hawk (since it must be after the hummingbird)\n6. **Sixth position:** Falcon (given)\n7. **Seventh position:** Crow (since it must be after the falcon)\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- Falcon is to the left of the crow: True (6th is left of 7th)\n- Quail is to the right of the cardinal: True (2nd is right of 1st)\n- Hummingbird is to the right of the quail: True (4th is right of 2nd)\n- Falcon is the second from the right: True (6th position)\n- Hummingbird is to the left of the hawk: True (4th is left of 5th)\n- Owl is the third from the left: True (3rd position)\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the owl is indeed the third from the left.\n\nThe correct answer is: <<<A>>>."
