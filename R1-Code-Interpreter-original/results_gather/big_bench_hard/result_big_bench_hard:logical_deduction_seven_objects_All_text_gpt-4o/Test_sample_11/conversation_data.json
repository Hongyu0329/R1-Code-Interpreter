    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books according to the given conditions and determine which book is fourth from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the fixed positions:**\n   - The yellow book is the rightmost (7th position).\n   - The black book is the fourth from the left (4th position).\n   - The brown book is the third from the right (5th position).\n\n2. **Initial arrangement based on fixed positions:**\n   - _ _ _ Black _ Brown Yellow\n\n3. **Analyze the remaining conditions:**\n   - The blue book is to the left of the orange book.\n   - The green book is to the right of the white book.\n   - The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n\n4. **Determine possible positions for the remaining books:**\n   - Since the blue book is to the left of the orange book, and the blue book is to the right of the green book, the order must be: Green, Blue, Orange.\n   - The green book is to the right of the white book, so the order must be: White, Green.\n\n5. **Fill in the remaining positions:**\n   - The only positions left are 1, 2, and 3.\n   - The order White, Green, Blue, Orange fits in these positions.\n\n6. **Final arrangement:**\n   - White, Green, Blue, Black, Brown, Orange, Yellow\n\n7. **Determine the book that is fourth from the left:**\n   - The black book is in the fourth position from the left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
