    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The sedan is the third-oldest.**\n   - This means there are two vehicles older than the sedan.\n\n2. **The tractor is newer than the motorcycle.**\n   - This implies the motorcycle is older than the tractor.\n\n3. **The bus is older than the motorcycle.**\n   - This means the bus is older than both the motorcycle and the tractor.\n\n4. **The bus is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This indicates the hatchback is older than the bus.\n\n5. **The minivan is the newest.**\n   - This places the minivan at the end of the order.\n\n6. **The station wagon is the oldest.**\n   - This places the station wagon at the beginning of the order.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- The station wagon is the oldest.\n- The hatchback is older than the bus, which is older than the motorcycle, which is older than the tractor.\n- The sedan is the third-oldest, so it must come after the station wagon and one other vehicle.\n- The minivan is the newest.\n\nGiven these constraints, the order from oldest to newest is:\n\n1. Station wagon\n2. Hatchback\n3. Sedan\n4. Bus\n5. Motorcycle\n6. Tractor\n7. Minivan\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- (A) The station wagon is the oldest\n- (B) The sedan is the oldest\n- (C) The bus is the oldest\n- (D) The motorcycle is the oldest\n- (E) The hatchback is the oldest\n- (F) The tractor is the oldest\n- (G) The minivan is the oldest\n\nThe correct answer, based on our analysis, is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
