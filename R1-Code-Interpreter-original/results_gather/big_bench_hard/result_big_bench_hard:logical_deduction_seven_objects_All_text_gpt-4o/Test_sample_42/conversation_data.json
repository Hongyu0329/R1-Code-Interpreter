    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The loquats are less expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means loquats are not the most expensive, and oranges are more expensive than loquats.\n\n2. **The oranges are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This places oranges in the third position from the top in terms of expense.\n\n3. **The apples are the cheapest.**\n   - Apples are in the last position (7th) in terms of expense.\n\n4. **The kiwis are more expensive than the pears.**\n   - Kiwis are not the cheapest, and pears are less expensive than kiwis.\n\n5. **The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons.**\n   - Mangoes are not the cheapest, and watermelons are less expensive than mangoes.\n\n6. **The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - Loquats are not the cheapest, and kiwis are less expensive than loquats.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these statements:\n\n- **Apples** are the cheapest (7th position).\n- **Oranges** are the third-most expensive (3rd position).\n- **Loquats** are less expensive than oranges but more expensive than kiwis. So, loquats are in the 4th position.\n- **Kiwis** are less expensive than loquats but more expensive than pears. So, kiwis are in the 5th position.\n- **Pears** are less expensive than kiwis. So, pears are in the 6th position.\n- **Mangoes** are more expensive than watermelons. Since oranges are in the 3rd position, mangoes must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Since loquats are in the 4th position, mangoes are in the 2nd position.\n- **Watermelons** are less expensive than mangoes. So, watermelons are in the 1st position.\n\nThe order from most expensive to cheapest is:\n1. Watermelons\n2. Mangoes\n3. Oranges\n4. Loquats\n5. Kiwis\n6. Pears\n7. Apples\n\nThe question asks which fruit is the cheapest. According to the arrangement, the apples are the cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
