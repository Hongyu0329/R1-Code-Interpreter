    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on the shelf according to the given conditions and then determine which book is third from the right.\n\n1. **Identify the positions of the books based on the given conditions:**\n\n   - The white book is the leftmost. Therefore, the white book is in position 1.\n   - The orange book is the second from the right. Therefore, the orange book is in position 6.\n   - The black book is the rightmost. Therefore, the black book is in position 7.\n   - The gray book is the fourth from the left. Therefore, the gray book is in position 4.\n\n2. **Use the remaining conditions to place the other books:**\n\n   - The red book is to the right of the blue book. This means the blue book must be placed before the red book.\n   - The gray book is to the right of the red book. Since the gray book is in position 4, the red book must be in position 3 or earlier.\n\n3. **Determine the possible positions for the blue and red books:**\n\n   - Since the red book must be to the right of the blue book and the gray book is in position 4, the red book can only be in position 3.\n   - Therefore, the blue book must be in position 2.\n\n4. **Place the remaining book:**\n\n   - The only book left is the brown book, which must be placed in the remaining position, which is position 5.\n\n5. **Final arrangement of books:**\n\n   - Position 1: White book\n   - Position 2: Blue book\n   - Position 3: Red book\n   - Position 4: Gray book\n   - Position 5: Brown book\n   - Position 6: Orange book\n   - Position 7: Black book\n\n6. **Determine which book is third from the right:**\n\n   - The third from the right is position 5, which is the brown book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
