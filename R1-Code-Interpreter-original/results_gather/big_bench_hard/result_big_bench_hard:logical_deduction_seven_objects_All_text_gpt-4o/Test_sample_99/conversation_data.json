    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. \"The motorcycle is older than the minivan.\"\n   - Motorcycle > Minivan\n\n2. \"The minivan is older than the tractor.\"\n   - Minivan > Tractor\n\n3. \"The bus is newer than the truck.\"\n   - Bus > Truck\n\n4. \"The station wagon is the third-newest.\"\n   - This means there are two vehicles newer than the station wagon.\n\n5. \"The sedan is older than the truck.\"\n   - Sedan > Truck\n\n6. \"The tractor is older than the sedan.\"\n   - Tractor > Sedan\n\nNow, let's try to arrange these vehicles in order from oldest to newest:\n\n- From statements 1 and 2, we have: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor\n- From statement 6, we have: Tractor > Sedan\n- From statement 5, we have: Sedan > Truck\n- From statement 3, we have: Truck < Bus\n- From statement 4, we know the station wagon is the third-newest.\n\nLet's combine these:\n\n- The oldest vehicle must be the motorcycle because it is older than the minivan, which is older than the tractor, which is older than the sedan.\n- The order from oldest to newest based on the above is: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan > Truck > Bus.\n- The station wagon is the third-newest, so it must be placed after the sedan and before the truck and bus.\n\nThus, the order is:\n1. Motorcycle\n2. Minivan\n3. Tractor\n4. Sedan\n5. Station Wagon\n6. Truck\n7. Bus\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the third-oldest:\n- The third-oldest vehicle in this order is the Tractor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
