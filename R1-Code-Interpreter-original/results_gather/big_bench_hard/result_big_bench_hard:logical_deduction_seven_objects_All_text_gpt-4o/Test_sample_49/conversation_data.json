    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The mangoes are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive.\n\n2. **The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - Plums cannot be in the top two positions since mangoes are third.\n\n3. **The watermelons are less expensive than the plums.**\n   - Watermelons are cheaper than plums, so they cannot be in the top three positions.\n\n4. **The watermelons are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - Oranges are cheaper than watermelons.\n\n5. **The kiwis are less expensive than the oranges.**\n   - Kiwis are cheaper than oranges, so they are cheaper than watermelons as well.\n\n6. **The apples are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - Apples are not the cheapest.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n- **Mangoes** are the third-most expensive.\n- **Plums** are less expensive than mangoes, so they can be fourth or lower.\n- **Watermelons** are less expensive than plums but more expensive than oranges, so they can be fifth.\n- **Oranges** are less expensive than watermelons, so they can be sixth.\n- **Kiwis** are less expensive than oranges, so they can be seventh.\n- **Apples** are more expensive than loquats, so loquats can be the cheapest.\n\nGiven these conditions, the order from most expensive to least expensive could be:\n\n1. (Most expensive)\n2. \n3. Mangoes\n4. Plums\n5. Watermelons\n6. Oranges\n7. Kiwis\n8. Loquats (Cheapest)\n\nSince loquats are the cheapest, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
