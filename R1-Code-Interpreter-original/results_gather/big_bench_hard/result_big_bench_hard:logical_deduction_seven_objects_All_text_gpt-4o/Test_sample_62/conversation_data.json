    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The purple book is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the purple book is in position 1.\n\n2. **The black book is the third from the left.**\n   - This places the black book in position 3.\n\n3. **The green book is the third from the right.**\n   - Since there are seven books, the third from the right is position 5. So, the green book is in position 5.\n\n4. **The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the yellow book must be placed before the brown book.\n\n5. **The green book is to the left of the orange book.**\n   - Since the green book is in position 5, the orange book must be in position 6 or 7.\n\n6. **The orange book is to the left of the gray book.**\n   - This means the gray book must be in position 7 if the orange book is in position 6.\n\nNow, let's try to place the remaining books:\n\n- We know the positions of the purple (1), black (3), and green (5) books.\n- The orange book must be in position 6 because it is to the left of the gray book, which must be in position 7.\n- This leaves positions 2 and 4 for the yellow and brown books.\n- Since the brown book is to the right of the yellow book, the yellow book must be in position 2, and the brown book must be in position 4.\n\nThe final order of the books from left to right is:\n1. Purple\n2. Yellow\n3. Black\n4. Brown\n5. Green\n6. Orange\n7. Gray\n\nThe rightmost book is the gray book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
