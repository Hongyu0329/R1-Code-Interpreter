    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and identify which book is the rightmost. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **The purple book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the purple book is in the 7th position.\n\n2. **The yellow book is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the yellow book is in the 1st position.\n\n3. **The orange book is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the orange book is in the 6th position.\n\n4. **The brown book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the brown book must be placed in a position that is numerically less than the position of the green book.\n\n5. **The brown book is to the right of the black book.**\n   - This means the brown book must be placed in a position that is numerically greater than the position of the black book.\n\n6. **The white book is the fourth from the left.**\n   - This means the white book is in the 4th position.\n\nNow, let's place the books according to these conditions:\n\n- Position 1: Yellow book\n- Position 4: White book\n- Position 6: Orange book\n- Position 7: Purple book\n\nNext, we need to place the brown, black, and green books in the remaining positions (2, 3, and 5) while satisfying the conditions that the brown book is to the left of the green book and to the right of the black book.\n\n- Since the brown book is to the right of the black book, the black book must be in position 2.\n- The brown book, being to the left of the green book, must be in position 3.\n- Consequently, the green book must be in position 5.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1. Yellow book\n2. Black book\n3. Brown book\n4. White book\n5. Green book\n6. Orange book\n7. Purple book\n\nAccording to the arrangement, the rightmost book is the purple book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
