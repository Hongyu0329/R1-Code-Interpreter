    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The pears are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This means there are two fruits cheaper than pears and four fruits more expensive than pears.\n\n2. **The kiwis are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit more expensive than kiwis.\n\n3. **The pears are more expensive than the plums.**\n   - Since pears are the third-cheapest, plums must be one of the two cheapest fruits.\n\n4. **The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - Since kiwis are the second-most expensive, oranges must be cheaper than kiwis.\n\n5. **The mangoes are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n\n6. **The peaches are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit cheaper than peaches.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- **Cheapest to Most Expensive:**\n  1. **Plums** (since pears are more expensive than plums and peaches are the second-cheapest)\n  2. **Peaches** (second-cheapest)\n  3. **Pears** (third-cheapest)\n  4. **Oranges** (since they are less expensive than kiwis and more expensive than pears)\n  5. **Watermelons** (by elimination, since it is not mentioned in any specific position)\n  6. **Mangoes** (third-most expensive)\n  7. **Kiwis** (second-most expensive)\n\nGiven this arrangement, the fourth-most expensive fruit is the **oranges**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
