    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means watermelons are priced higher than cantaloupes.\n\n2. **The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means cantaloupes are priced higher than apples.\n\n3. **The watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This places watermelons in the second position from the top in terms of price.\n\n4. **The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - This means kiwis are priced higher than loquats.\n\n5. **The apples are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - This means apples are priced higher than loquats.\n\n6. **The loquats are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This places loquats in the third position from the bottom in terms of price.\n\n7. **The plums are the cheapest.**\n   - This places plums in the first position from the bottom in terms of price.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these statements:\n\n- **Plums** are the cheapest (1st position from the bottom).\n- **Loquats** are the third-cheapest (3rd position from the bottom).\n- **Apples** are more expensive than loquats but less expensive than cantaloupes, so they are in the 4th position from the bottom.\n- **Kiwis** are more expensive than loquats, so they are in the 5th position from the bottom.\n- **Cantaloupes** are more expensive than apples but less expensive than watermelons, so they are in the 3rd position from the top.\n- **Watermelons** are the second-most expensive, so they are in the 2nd position from the top.\n- The only fruit left is **pears**, which must be the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Plums\n2. (Unknown)\n3. Loquats\n4. Apples\n5. Kiwis\n6. Cantaloupes\n7. Watermelons\n8. Pears (most expensive)\n\nThe pears are the most expensive.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
