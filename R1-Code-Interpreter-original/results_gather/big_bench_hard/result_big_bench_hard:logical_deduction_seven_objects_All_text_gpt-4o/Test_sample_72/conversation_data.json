    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **The truck is the oldest.**\n   - This means the truck is in the first position in terms of age.\n\n2. **The bus is the second-oldest.**\n   - This places the bus in the second position.\n\n3. **The minivan is the third-newest.**\n   - Since there are seven vehicles, the third-newest is the fifth position from the oldest.\n\n4. **The limousine is the fourth-newest.**\n   - This places the limousine in the fourth position from the oldest, which is the fourth position overall.\n\n5. **The tractor is older than the minivan.**\n   - Since the minivan is in the fifth position, the tractor must be in either the third or fourth position. However, the fourth position is already occupied by the limousine, so the tractor must be in the third position.\n\n6. **The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback must be older than the station wagon. Since the positions from first to fifth are already occupied (truck, bus, tractor, limousine, minivan), the hatchback must be in the sixth position and the station wagon in the seventh position.\n\nNow, let's list the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the analysis:\n\n1. Truck\n2. Bus\n3. Tractor\n4. Limousine\n5. Minivan\n6. Hatchback\n7. Station Wagon\n\nThe question asks which vehicle is the oldest. Based on the analysis, the truck is the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
