    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and identify which book is the leftmost. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **The purple book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the purple book is in position 7.\n\n2. **The yellow book is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the yellow book is in position 1.\n\n3. **The orange book is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the orange book is in position 6.\n\n4. **The brown book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the brown book is positioned somewhere before the green book.\n\n5. **The brown book is to the right of the black book.**\n   - This means the black book is positioned somewhere before the brown book.\n\n6. **The white book is the fourth from the left.**\n   - This means the white book is in position 4.\n\nNow, let's arrange the books based on these conditions:\n\n- Position 1: Yellow book (from condition 2)\n- Position 2: Black book (since it must be before the brown book)\n- Position 3: Brown book (since it must be after the black book and before the green book)\n- Position 4: White book (from condition 6)\n- Position 5: Green book (since it must be after the brown book)\n- Position 6: Orange book (from condition 3)\n- Position 7: Purple book (from condition 1)\n\nWith this arrangement, we can see that the yellow book is indeed the leftmost book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
