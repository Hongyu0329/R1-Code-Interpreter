    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The pears are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This means there are two fruits cheaper than pears.\n\n2. **The kiwis are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit more expensive than kiwis.\n\n3. **The pears are more expensive than the plums.**\n   - This implies that plums are one of the two cheapest fruits.\n\n4. **The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - Oranges cannot be the most expensive or the second-most expensive.\n\n5. **The mangoes are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n\n6. **The peaches are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit cheaper than peaches.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since peaches are the second-cheapest, and pears are the third-cheapest, plums must be the cheapest.\n- The order from cheapest to most expensive starts with plums, then peaches, then pears.\n- The kiwis are the second-most expensive, so they are the sixth in the order.\n- The mangoes are the third-most expensive, so they are the fifth in the order.\n- Oranges are less expensive than kiwis, so they cannot be the most expensive. They must be the fourth in the order.\n- The only fruit left is watermelons, which must be the most expensive.\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is: plums, peaches, pears, oranges, mangoes, kiwis, watermelons.\n\nNow, let's check the options to find the second-cheapest fruit:\n\n- (A) The kiwis are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n- (B) The plums are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, plums are the cheapest.\n- (C) The mangoes are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n- (D) The watermelons are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, watermelons are the most expensive.\n- (E) The pears are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, pears are the third-cheapest.\n- (F) The peaches are the second-cheapest: Correct, as per the given information.\n- (G) The oranges are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, oranges are the fourth in the order.\n\nThe correct answer is option (F).\n\n<<<F>>>"
