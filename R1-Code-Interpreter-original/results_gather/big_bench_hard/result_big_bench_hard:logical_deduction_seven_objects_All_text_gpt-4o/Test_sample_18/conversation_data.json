    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest.**\n   - This means there are three vehicles newer than the station wagon and three vehicles older than it.\n\n2. **The minivan is the third-newest.**\n   - This means there are two vehicles newer than the minivan and four vehicles older than it.\n\n3. **The tractor is the second-oldest.**\n   - This means there is only one vehicle older than the tractor.\n\n4. **The convertible is older than the station wagon.**\n   - This places the convertible somewhere in the three positions older than the station wagon.\n\n5. **The truck is newer than the bus.**\n   - This means the bus is older than the truck.\n\n6. **The hatchback is older than the convertible.**\n   - This places the hatchback in one of the positions older than the convertible.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these clues:\n\n- Since the tractor is the second-oldest, it must be in the second position from the oldest.\n- The hatchback is older than the convertible, and the convertible is older than the station wagon. Therefore, the hatchback must be in one of the first three positions.\n- The station wagon is the fourth-newest, so it is in the fourth position from the newest.\n- The minivan is the third-newest, so it is in the third position from the newest.\n- The truck is newer than the bus, so the bus must be older than the truck.\n\nLet's try to place them:\n\n1. Oldest: ?\n2. Second-oldest: Tractor\n3. Third-oldest: ?\n4. Fourth-oldest: Convertible (since it is older than the station wagon)\n5. Fifth-oldest: Station Wagon\n6. Sixth-oldest: Minivan\n7. Newest: ?\n\nNow, we need to fill in the remaining positions:\n\n- The hatchback must be older than the convertible, so it can be in the first or third position.\n- The bus must be older than the truck, so it can be in the first or third position.\n\nLet's try placing the hatchback in the first position:\n\n1. Oldest: Hatchback\n2. Second-oldest: Tractor\n3. Third-oldest: Bus\n4. Fourth-oldest: Convertible\n5. Fifth-oldest: Station Wagon\n6. Sixth-oldest: Minivan\n7. Newest: Truck\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- The hatchback is older than the convertible.\n- The convertible is older than the station wagon.\n- The truck is newer than the bus.\n- The minivan is the third-newest.\n- The station wagon is the fourth-newest.\n- The tractor is the second-oldest.\n\nTherefore, the third-oldest vehicle is the bus.\n\nThe answer is: <<<D>>>."
