    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. Ana finished last.  \n   - This means Ana is in the 7th position.\n\n2. Mya finished above Rob.  \n   - This means Mya's position is better (lower number) than Rob's.\n\n3. Dan finished above Mya.  \n   - This means Dan's position is better than Mya's.\n\n4. Rob finished fourth.  \n   - This means Rob is in the 4th position.\n\n5. Eli finished second.  \n   - This means Eli is in the 2nd position.\n\n6. Mel finished above Ada.  \n   - This means Mel's position is better than Ada's.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the positions:\n\n- Since Rob is 4th, and Mya finished above Rob, Mya must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- Dan finished above Mya, so Dan must be in one of the positions 1 or 2.\n- Eli is 2nd, so Dan must be 1st.\n- This means Mya must be 3rd because she is above Rob (4th) and below Dan (1st).\n- Ana is 7th.\n- Mel finished above Ada, so Mel must be 5th and Ada 6th, as they are the only remaining positions.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Dan\n2. Eli\n3. Mya\n4. Rob\n5. Mel\n6. Ada\n7. Ana\n\nNow, we check the options to see who finished fourth:\n- Rob finished fourth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
