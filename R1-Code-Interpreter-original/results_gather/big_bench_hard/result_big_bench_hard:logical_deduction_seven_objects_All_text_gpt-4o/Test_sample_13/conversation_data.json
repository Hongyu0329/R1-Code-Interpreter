    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in position 1.\n\n2. **The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.**\n   - This places the hummingbird in position 4.\n\n3. **The blue jay is the third from the right.**\n   - Since there are seven positions, the third from the right is position 5. Therefore, the blue jay is in position 5.\n\n4. **The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.**\n   - Since the hummingbird is in position 4, the crow must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n\n5. **The quail is to the right of the crow.**\n   - This means the crow cannot be in position 7, as there would be no room for the quail to be to its right. Therefore, the crow must be in position 6, and the quail must be in position 7.\n\n6. **The raven is to the left of the robin.**\n   - The remaining positions are 2 and 3. The raven must be in position 2, and the robin must be in position 3.\n\nNow, let's list the positions of the birds:\n\n1. Cardinal\n2. Raven\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Blue Jay\n6. Crow\n7. Quail\n\nWe need to determine which bird is the third from the right. The third from the right is position 5, which is occupied by the Blue Jay.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
