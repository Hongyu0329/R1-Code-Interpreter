    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Mangoes are the cheapest**: This means mangoes are in the 7th position in terms of price.\n\n2. **Kiwis are the third-cheapest**: This means kiwis are in the 5th position in terms of price.\n\n3. **Cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive**: This means cantaloupes are in the 4th position in terms of price.\n\n4. **Pears are less expensive than cantaloupes**: Since cantaloupes are in the 4th position, pears must be in a position lower than 4th. The possible positions for pears are 5th, 6th, or 7th. However, since kiwis are already in the 5th position and mangoes are in the 7th, pears must be in the 6th position.\n\n5. **Peaches are the second-most expensive**: This means peaches are in the 2nd position in terms of price.\n\n6. **Oranges are more expensive than peaches**: Since peaches are in the 2nd position, oranges must be in the 1st position.\n\nNow, let's list the fruits in order of their prices from most expensive to least expensive:\n\n1. Oranges\n2. Peaches\n3. (Unknown)\n4. Cantaloupes\n5. Kiwis\n6. Pears\n7. Mangoes\n\nThe only fruit not yet placed is watermelons, which must be in the 3rd position.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The watermelons are the fourth-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the third-most expensive.\n(B) The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the cheapest.\n(C) The kiwis are the fourth-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the third-cheapest.\n(D) The pears are the fourth-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the second-cheapest.\n(E) The cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive - Correct, as given in the problem.\n(F) The oranges are the fourth-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the most expensive.\n(G) The peaches are the fourth-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the second-most expensive.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
