    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds on the branch according to the given conditions and determine which bird is second from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the positions based on given conditions:**\n   - There are seven positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n   - The owl is the second from the right, so the owl is in position 6.\n   - The cardinal is the fourth from the left, so the cardinal is in position 4.\n   - The raven is the second from the left, so the raven is in position 2.\n\n2. **Apply the remaining conditions:**\n   - The falcon is to the left of the blue jay.\n   - The quail is to the left of the falcon.\n   - The robin is to the left of the quail.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of the remaining birds:**\n   - Since the raven is in position 2, the only available position to the left is position 1.\n   - The robin must be in position 1 because it is to the left of the quail.\n   - The quail must be in position 3 because it is to the left of the falcon.\n   - The falcon must be in position 5 because it is to the left of the blue jay.\n   - The blue jay must be in position 7 because it is the only remaining position.\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - Position 1: Robin\n   - Position 2: Raven\n   - Position 3: Quail\n   - Position 4: Cardinal\n   - Position 5: Falcon\n   - Position 6: Owl\n   - Position 7: Blue Jay\n\n5. **Determine which bird is second from the left:**\n   - The bird in position 2 is the raven.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
