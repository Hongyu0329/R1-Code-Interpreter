    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The minivan is the oldest.**\n   - This directly tells us that the minivan is the first in the order.\n\n2. **The bus is the second-newest.**\n   - This tells us that the bus is the sixth in the order.\n\n3. **The motorcyle is older than the truck.**\n   - This means the motorcycle comes before the truck in the order.\n\n4. **The station wagon is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the station wagon comes before the hatchback in the order.\n\n5. **The motorcyle is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the motorcycle comes after the hatchback in the order.\n\n6. **The limousine is older than the station wagon.**\n   - This means the limousine comes before the station wagon in the order.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these constraints:\n\n- We know the minivan is the oldest, so it is first.\n- The bus is the second-newest, so it is sixth.\n- The motorcycle is older than the truck and newer than the hatchback, so the order must be: hatchback, motorcycle, truck.\n- The station wagon is older than the hatchback, so it must come before the hatchback.\n- The limousine is older than the station wagon, so it must come before the station wagon.\n\nGiven these constraints, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Minivan\n2. Limousine\n3. Station Wagon\n4. Hatchback\n5. Motorcycle\n6. Bus\n7. Truck\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The station wagon is the oldest - Incorrect\n(B) The limousine is the oldest - Incorrect\n(C) The truck is the oldest - Incorrect\n(D) The minivan is the oldest - Correct\n(E) The motorcyle is the oldest - Incorrect\n(F) The hatchback is the oldest - Incorrect\n(G) The bus is the oldest - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
