    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The pears are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means pears > oranges.\n\n2. **The oranges are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means oranges > cantaloupes.\n\n3. **The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means peaches < cantaloupes.\n\n4. **The apples are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This means there are two fruits cheaper than apples.\n\n5. **The watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit more expensive than watermelons.\n\n6. **The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are three fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n- From statement 4, apples are the third-cheapest, so there are two fruits cheaper than apples.\n- From statement 5, watermelons are the second-most expensive, so there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.\n- From statement 6, mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, so there are three fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's start arranging from the cheapest:\n\n- Since apples are the third-cheapest, the two cheapest fruits must be among pears, oranges, cantaloupes, and peaches.\n- From statements 1, 2, and 3, we know: pears > oranges > cantaloupes and peaches < cantaloupes.\n- Therefore, the order of the cheapest fruits must be: peaches, cantaloupes, apples.\n\nNow, we have:\n1. Peaches\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Apples\n\nNext, we need to place the remaining fruits: pears, oranges, watermelons, and mangoes.\n\n- From statement 5, watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- From statement 6, mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nLet's place watermelons and mangoes:\n- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, they are in position 6.\n- Mangoes, being the fourth-most expensive, are in position 4.\n\nNow, we have:\n1. Peaches\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Apples\n4. Mangoes\n5. ?\n6. Watermelons\n7. ?\n\nThe remaining fruits are pears and oranges. From statement 1, pears > oranges, so pears must be more expensive than oranges.\n\n- Since watermelons are in position 6, pears must be in position 7 (most expensive).\n- Oranges, being less expensive than pears, must be in position 5.\n\nFinal order:\n1. Peaches\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Apples\n4. Mangoes\n5. Oranges\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nFrom this order, the cheapest fruit is peaches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<F>>>."
