    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Mangoes are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive.\n\n2. **Plums are less expensive than mangoes.**\n   - Plums cannot be in the top three positions since mangoes are third.\n\n3. **Watermelons are less expensive than plums.**\n   - Watermelons are cheaper than plums, so they cannot be in the top four positions.\n\n4. **Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.**\n   - Oranges are cheaper than watermelons, so oranges cannot be in the top five positions.\n\n5. **Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.**\n   - Kiwis are cheaper than oranges, so kiwis cannot be in the top six positions.\n\n6. **Apples are more expensive than loquats.**\n   - Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats cannot be more expensive than apples.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n- **Mangoes** are the third-most expensive.\n- **Plums** are less expensive than mangoes, so they can be fourth or lower.\n- **Watermelons** are less expensive than plums and more expensive than oranges, so they can be fifth.\n- **Oranges** are less expensive than watermelons, so they can be sixth.\n- **Kiwis** are less expensive than oranges, so they must be seventh.\n- **Apples** are more expensive than loquats, so apples can be first or second, and loquats can be second or first.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the only possible arrangement is:\n\n1. Apples\n2. Loquats\n3. Mangoes\n4. Plums\n5. Watermelons\n6. Oranges\n7. Kiwis\n\nFrom this arrangement, we see that **loquats** are the second-cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>."
