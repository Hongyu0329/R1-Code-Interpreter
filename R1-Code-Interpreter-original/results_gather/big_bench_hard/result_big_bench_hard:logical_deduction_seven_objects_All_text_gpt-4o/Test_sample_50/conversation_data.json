  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells seven fruits: mangoes, cantaloupes, apples, plums, loquats, watermelons, and peaches. The plums are more expensive than the mangoes. The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats. The loquats are the second-cheapest. The plums are less expensive than the peaches. The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive. The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\nOptions:\n(A) The mangoes are the third-cheapest\n(B) The cantaloupes are the third-cheapest\n(C) The apples are the third-cheapest\n(D) The plums are the third-cheapest\n(E) The loquats are the third-cheapest\n(F) The watermelons are the third-cheapest\n(G) The peaches are the third-cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The loquats are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit cheaper than loquats.\n\n2. **The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are three fruits cheaper than mangoes.\n\n3. **The plums are more expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - Plums must be more expensive than the fourth position.\n\n4. **The plums are less expensive than the peaches.**\n   - Peaches must be more expensive than plums.\n\n5. **The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - Cantaloupes must be more expensive than peaches.\n\n6. **The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - Watermelons must be more expensive than the second position.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since loquats are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, so they are in position 4.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than loquats, so they cannot be in position 1 or 2. They must be in position 3.\n- Plums are more expensive than mangoes, so they must be in position 5 or higher.\n- Peaches are more expensive than plums, so they must be in position 6 or 7.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches, so they must be in position 7.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's fill in the positions:\n\n1. Cheapest: Apples (since loquats are second-cheapest and watermelons are more expensive than loquats)\n2. Second-cheapest: Loquats\n3. Third-cheapest: Watermelons\n4. Fourth-most expensive: Mangoes\n5. Fifth: Plums\n6. Sixth: Peaches\n7. Seventh: Cantaloupes\n\nNow, we can see that the third-cheapest fruit is watermelons.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<F>>>"
