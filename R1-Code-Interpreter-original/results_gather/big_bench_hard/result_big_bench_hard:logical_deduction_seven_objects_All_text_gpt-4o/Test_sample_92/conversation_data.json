    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books according to the given conditions and determine which book is the rightmost.\n\n1. **Identify the books and their positions:**\n   - Books: Brown, White, Black, Yellow, Orange, Blue, Green.\n\n2. **Apply the conditions:**\n   - The yellow book is the rightmost.\n   - The blue book is to the left of the orange book.\n   - The green book is to the right of the white book.\n   - The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n   - The black book is the fourth from the left.\n   - The brown book is the third from the right.\n\n3. **Analyze the conditions:**\n   - Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it must be in the 7th position.\n   - The black book is the fourth from the left, so it is in the 4th position.\n   - The brown book is the third from the right, which means it is in the 5th position (since the yellow book is in the 7th position).\n   - The blue book is to the left of the orange book, so the blue book must be placed before the orange book.\n   - The green book is to the right of the white book, so the white book must be placed before the green book.\n   - The blue book is to the right of the green book, so the green book must be placed before the blue book.\n\n4. **Determine the positions:**\n   - Position 7: Yellow book.\n   - Position 5: Brown book.\n   - Position 4: Black book.\n   - The remaining positions are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n5. **Place the remaining books:**\n   - Since the green book is to the right of the white book and the blue book is to the right of the green book, the order must be: White, Green, Blue.\n   - The blue book must be to the left of the orange book, so the order must be: White, Green, Blue, Orange.\n\n6. **Fill in the positions:**\n   - Position 1: White book.\n   - Position 2: Green book.\n   - Position 3: Blue book.\n   - Position 6: Orange book.\n\n7. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - 1st: White\n   - 2nd: Green\n   - 3rd: Blue\n   - 4th: Black\n   - 5th: Brown\n   - 6th: Orange\n   - 7th: Yellow\n\nThe yellow book is indeed the rightmost book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
