    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The plums are the cheapest.**\n   - This means plums are in the 7th position in terms of price.\n\n2. **The watermelons are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This places watermelons in the 3rd position.\n\n3. **The apples are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - Apples are priced higher than oranges, so apples are placed before oranges in the order.\n\n4. **The kiwis are the most expensive.**\n   - Kiwis are in the 1st position.\n\n5. **The apples are less expensive than the peaches.**\n   - Apples are priced lower than peaches, so apples are placed after peaches in the order.\n\n6. **The loquats are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This places loquats in the 5th position.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on the information:\n\n- **1st position (most expensive):** Kiwis\n- **2nd position:** Unknown\n- **3rd position:** Watermelons\n- **4th position:** Unknown\n- **5th position:** Loquats\n- **6th position:** Unknown\n- **7th position (cheapest):** Plums\n\nFrom the information about apples and peaches:\n- Apples are more expensive than oranges and less expensive than peaches. Therefore, the order must be: Peaches > Apples > Oranges.\n\nSince loquats are in the 5th position, and plums are in the 7th, the only positions left for peaches, apples, and oranges are 2nd, 4th, and 6th. Given the order Peaches > Apples > Oranges, we can place them as follows:\n- **2nd position:** Peaches\n- **4th position:** Apples\n- **6th position:** Oranges\n\nNow, the complete order is:\n1. Kiwis\n2. Peaches\n3. Watermelons\n4. Apples\n5. Loquats\n6. Oranges\n7. Plums\n\nFinally, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. According to our arrangement, the second-most expensive fruit is Peaches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
