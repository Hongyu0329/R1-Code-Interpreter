    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the seven golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Ada finished below Amy.**\n   - This means Amy finished higher than Ada.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Dan.**\n   - This means Dan finished higher than Joe.\n\n3. **Dan finished below Ada.**\n   - This means Ada finished higher than Dan.\n\n4. **Mel finished third-to-last.**\n   - This means Mel finished in the 5th position.\n\n5. **Amy finished third.**\n   - This means Amy finished in the 3rd position.\n\n6. **Rob finished below Mya.**\n   - This means Mya finished higher than Rob.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order:\n\n- Since Amy finished 3rd, we have: _ _ Amy _ _ Mel _\n\n- Ada must finish below Amy, so Ada cannot be 1st or 2nd. \n\n- Dan must finish below Ada, so Dan cannot be 1st or 2nd either.\n\n- Joe must finish below Dan, so Joe cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.\n\n- Mel is 5th, so the positions left are 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th.\n\n- Rob must finish below Mya, so Rob cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.\n\nLet's try to fill in the positions:\n\n- Since Amy is 3rd and Mel is 5th, the possible positions for Ada, Dan, Joe, Mya, and Rob are 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th.\n\n- Ada must be higher than Dan, and Dan must be higher than Joe. So, Ada can be 1st or 2nd, Dan can be 2nd or 4th, and Joe can be 4th, 6th, or 7th.\n\n- Mya must be higher than Rob, so Mya can be 1st, 2nd, or 4th, and Rob can be 6th or 7th.\n\nLet's try to assign positions:\n\n- If Ada is 1st, then Dan can be 2nd, and Joe can be 4th. Mya can be 6th, and Rob can be 7th. This satisfies all conditions.\n\n- If Ada is 2nd, then Dan can be 4th, and Joe can be 6th. Mya can be 1st, and Rob can be 7th. This also satisfies all conditions.\n\nIn both scenarios, Amy is 3rd, which matches the given condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Amy finished third.\n\n<<<D>>>"
