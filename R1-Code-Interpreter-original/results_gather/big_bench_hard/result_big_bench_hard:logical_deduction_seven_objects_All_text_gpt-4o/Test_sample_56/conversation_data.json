    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The bus is newer than the sedan.**\n   - This means the sedan is older than the bus.\n\n2. **The motorcycle is older than the truck.**\n   - This means the truck is newer than the motorcycle.\n\n3. **The station wagon is older than the motorcycle.**\n   - This means the motorcycle is newer than the station wagon.\n\n4. **The sedan is newer than the convertible.**\n   - This means the convertible is older than the sedan.\n\n5. **The station wagon is newer than the bus.**\n   - This means the bus is older than the station wagon.\n\n6. **The minivan is the fourth-newest.**\n   - This means there are three vehicles older than the minivan and three vehicles newer than the minivan.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- From statement 6, the minivan is the fourth-newest, so it is in the middle.\n- From statements 3 and 5, the order of the station wagon, motorcycle, and bus is: Bus < Station Wagon < Motorcycle.\n- From statements 1 and 4, the order of the convertible, sedan, and bus is: Convertible < Sedan < Bus.\n- From statement 2, the motorcycle is older than the truck.\n\nCombining these, we can deduce the following order from oldest to newest:\n\n1. Convertible\n2. Sedan\n3. Bus\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Motorcycle\n6. Truck\n7. Minivan\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the second-newest:\n\n- The order from newest to oldest is: Minivan, Truck, Motorcycle, Station Wagon, Bus, Sedan, Convertible.\n- Therefore, the second-newest vehicle is the Truck.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
