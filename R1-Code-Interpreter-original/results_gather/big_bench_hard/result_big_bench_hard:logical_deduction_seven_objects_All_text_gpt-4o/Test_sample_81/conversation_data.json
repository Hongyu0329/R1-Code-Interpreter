    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on a shelf according to the given conditions and determine which book is third from the left. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Books on the shelf**: Purple, Green, White, Gray, Red, Black, Brown.\n\n2. **Condition 1**: The gray book is to the left of the purple book.\n   - This means Gray is somewhere before Purple.\n\n3. **Condition 2**: The white book is to the right of the brown book.\n   - This means Brown is somewhere before White.\n\n4. **Condition 3**: The black book is the third from the right.\n   - This means the position of Black is 5th from the left (since there are 7 books).\n\n5. **Condition 4**: The purple book is to the left of the white book.\n   - This means Purple is somewhere before White.\n\n6. **Condition 5**: The white book is the second from the right.\n   - This means the position of White is 6th from the left.\n\n7. **Condition 6**: The gray book is the third from the left.\n   - This means the position of Gray is 3rd from the left.\n\n8. **Condition 7**: The brown book is to the right of the green book.\n   - This means Green is somewhere before Brown.\n\nNow, let's place the books according to these conditions:\n\n- From Condition 6, Gray is 3rd from the left.\n- From Condition 5, White is 6th from the left.\n- From Condition 3, Black is 5th from the left.\n\nNow, the positions are:\n1. ?\n2. ?\n3. Gray\n4. ?\n5. Black\n6. White\n7. ?\n\n- From Condition 1, Gray is to the left of Purple, so Purple cannot be in position 1 or 2.\n- From Condition 4, Purple is to the left of White, so Purple must be in position 4.\n- From Condition 2, Brown is to the left of White, so Brown must be in position 1 or 2.\n- From Condition 7, Green is to the left of Brown, so Green must be in position 1.\n\nNow, the positions are:\n1. Green\n2. Brown\n3. Gray\n4. Purple\n5. Black\n6. White\n7. Red\n\nThe book that is third from the left is the Gray book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
