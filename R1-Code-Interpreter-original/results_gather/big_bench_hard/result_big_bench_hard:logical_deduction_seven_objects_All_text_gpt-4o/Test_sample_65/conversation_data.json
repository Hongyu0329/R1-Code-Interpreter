    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The pears are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is one fruit cheaper than pears, and five fruits more expensive than pears.\n\n2. **The peaches are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means cantaloupes are cheaper than peaches.\n\n3. **The peaches are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This means mangoes are more expensive than peaches.\n\n4. **The cantaloupes are more expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - This means kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n\n5. **The oranges are the fourth-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are three fruits more expensive than oranges and three fruits cheaper than oranges.\n\n6. **The watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons, and five fruits cheaper than watermelons.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, they are in position 2.\n- Oranges are the fourth-most expensive, so they are in position 4.\n- Pears are the second-cheapest, so they are in position 6.\n- Since mangoes are more expensive than peaches, and peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes, the order among these three is: mangoes > peaches > cantaloupes.\n- Since cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis, the order is: cantaloupes > kiwis.\n\nLet's place these in the order:\n\n1. **Mangoes** (most expensive, since they are more expensive than peaches and watermelons are second)\n2. **Watermelons** (second-most expensive)\n3. **Peaches** (since they are less expensive than mangoes and more expensive than cantaloupes)\n4. **Oranges** (fourth-most expensive)\n5. **Cantaloupes** (since they are more expensive than kiwis and less expensive than peaches)\n6. **Pears** (second-cheapest)\n7. **Kiwis** (cheapest, since they are less expensive than cantaloupes)\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the third-most expensive. From the order above, the third-most expensive fruit is:\n\n3. **Peaches**\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
