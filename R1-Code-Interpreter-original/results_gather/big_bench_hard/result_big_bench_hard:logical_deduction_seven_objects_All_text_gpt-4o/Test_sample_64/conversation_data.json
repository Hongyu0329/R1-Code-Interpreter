    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the seven golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **Ada finished below Amy.**\n   - This means Amy finished higher than Ada.\n\n2. **Joe finished below Dan.**\n   - This means Dan finished higher than Joe.\n\n3. **Dan finished below Ada.**\n   - This means Ada finished higher than Dan.\n\n4. **Mel finished third-to-last.**\n   - This means Mel finished in the 5th position.\n\n5. **Amy finished third.**\n   - This means Amy finished in the 3rd position.\n\n6. **Rob finished below Mya.**\n   - This means Mya finished higher than Rob.\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to determine the order:\n\n- Since Amy finished 3rd, and Ada finished below Amy, Ada cannot be 1st or 2nd. \n- Dan finished below Ada, so Dan cannot be 1st or 2nd either.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.\n- Mel is 5th.\n- Rob finished below Mya, so Rob cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.\n\nLet's try to place the golfers:\n\n- **1st and 2nd positions:** Since Amy is 3rd, and Ada is above Dan, Ada could be 1st or 2nd. If Ada is 1st, Dan could be 2nd. If Ada is 2nd, Dan could be 1st.\n- **4th position:** Since Mel is 5th, and Joe is below Dan, Joe could be 4th.\n- **6th and 7th positions:** Since Rob is below Mya, Mya could be 6th and Rob 7th.\n\nLet's try to fit these into a possible order:\n\n1. Ada\n2. Dan\n3. Amy\n4. Joe\n5. Mel\n6. Mya\n7. Rob\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n- Ada is above Dan and Amy is above Ada.\n- Dan is above Joe.\n- Mel is 5th.\n- Mya is above Rob.\n\nNow, let's check the options for who finished last:\n\n- (A) Joe finished last - No, Joe is 4th.\n- (B) Dan finished last - No, Dan is 2nd.\n- (C) Ada finished last - No, Ada is 1st.\n- (D) Amy finished last - No, Amy is 3rd.\n- (E) Rob finished last - Yes, Rob is 7th.\n- (F) Mya finished last - No, Mya is 6th.\n- (G) Mel finished last - No, Mel is 5th.\n\nThe correct answer is that Rob finished last.\n\n<<<E>>>"
