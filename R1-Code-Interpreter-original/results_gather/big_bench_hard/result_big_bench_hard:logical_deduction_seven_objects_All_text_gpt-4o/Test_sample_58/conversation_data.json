    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Oranges are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit cheaper than oranges.\n\n2. **Apples are less expensive than pears.**\n   - Apples are cheaper than pears, but we don't know their exact positions yet.\n\n3. **Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes.**\n   - Mangoes are priced higher than cantaloupes.\n\n4. **Mangoes are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This means there are two fruits cheaper than mangoes.\n\n5. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit more expensive than watermelons.\n\n6. **Loquats are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than loquats.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since oranges are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- Mangoes are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- Loquats are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining positions:\n\n- Since mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes, cantaloupes must be in position 1 (the cheapest).\n- Apples are less expensive than pears, so apples must be in position 4, and pears must be in position 7 (the most expensive).\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Oranges\n3. Mangoes\n4. Apples\n5. Loquats\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nNow, let's determine which fruit is the fourth-most expensive:\n- The fruit in position 4 is apples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<D>>>"
