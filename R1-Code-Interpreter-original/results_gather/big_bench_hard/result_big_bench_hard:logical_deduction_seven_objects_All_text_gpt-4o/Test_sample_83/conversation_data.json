    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The truck is the oldest.**\n   - This means the truck is in the first position.\n\n2. **The tractor is the newest.**\n   - This means the tractor is in the seventh position.\n\n3. **The sedan is older than the station wagon.**\n   - This means the sedan comes before the station wagon in the order.\n\n4. **The station wagon is the third-newest.**\n   - This means the station wagon is in the fifth position.\n\n5. **The bus is older than the convertible.**\n   - This means the bus comes before the convertible in the order.\n\n6. **The sedan is newer than the convertible.**\n   - This means the convertible comes before the sedan in the order.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on these statements:\n\n- **Truck** is the oldest, so it is in position 1.\n- **Tractor** is the newest, so it is in position 7.\n- **Station wagon** is the third-newest, so it is in position 5.\n\nGiven the relationships:\n- The **sedan** is older than the station wagon (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).\n- The **sedan** is newer than the convertible (so the convertible must be in position 2 or 3).\n- The **bus** is older than the convertible.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining vehicles:\n\n- Since the bus is older than the convertible, and the convertible is older than the sedan, the bus must be in position 2, the convertible in position 3, and the sedan in position 4.\n\nNow, we have:\n1. Truck\n2. Bus\n3. Convertible\n4. Sedan\n5. Station Wagon\n6. Limousine (by elimination, since it's the only one left)\n7. Tractor\n\nThe fourth-newest vehicle is the **sedan**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
