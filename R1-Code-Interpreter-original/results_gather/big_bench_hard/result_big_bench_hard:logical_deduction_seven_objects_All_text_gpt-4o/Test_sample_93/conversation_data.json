    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on the shelf according to the given conditions and then determine which book is second from the right.\n\n1. **Identify the positions based on given conditions:**\n   - The white book is the fourth from the left. This means the white book is in position 4.\n   - The black book is the second from the left. This means the black book is in position 2.\n\n2. **Determine relative positions:**\n   - The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n   - The green book is to the left of the white book.\n   - The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n   - The green book is to the right of the orange book.\n\n3. **Start placing books based on fixed positions:**\n   - Position 2: Black book\n   - Position 4: White book\n\n4. **Place the green book:**\n   - The green book must be to the left of the white book (position 4) and to the right of the orange book.\n   - Possible positions for the green book are 3 or 1.\n\n5. **Place the orange book:**\n   - The orange book must be to the left of the green book.\n   - If the green book is in position 3, the orange book must be in position 1.\n\n6. **Place the purple and yellow books:**\n   - The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n   - Possible positions for the purple and yellow books are 5, 6, and 7.\n   - Since the brown book is to the right of the yellow book, the yellow book cannot be in position 7.\n\n7. **Determine the positions for purple, yellow, and brown books:**\n   - If the yellow book is in position 6, the purple book must be in position 5, and the brown book in position 7.\n\n8. **Verify all conditions:**\n   - The purple book is to the left of the yellow book (position 5 and 6).\n   - The green book is to the left of the white book (position 3 and 4).\n   - The brown book is to the right of the yellow book (position 7 and 6).\n   - The green book is to the right of the orange book (position 3 and 1).\n   - The black book is the second from the left (position 2).\n   - The white book is the fourth from the left (position 4).\n\n9. **Final arrangement:**\n   - Position 1: Orange book\n   - Position 2: Black book\n   - Position 3: Green book\n   - Position 4: White book\n   - Position 5: Purple book\n   - Position 6: Yellow book\n   - Position 7: Brown book\n\n10. **Determine which book is second from the right:**\n    - The second from the right is position 6, which is the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"
