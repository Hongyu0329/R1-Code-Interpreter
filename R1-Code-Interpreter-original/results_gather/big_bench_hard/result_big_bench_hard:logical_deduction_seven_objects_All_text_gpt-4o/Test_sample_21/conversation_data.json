    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the 6th position from the left.\n\n2. **The hawk is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the hawk is in the 7th position from the left.\n\n3. **The owl is to the left of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the owl must be positioned somewhere to the left of the hummingbird.\n\n4. **The robin is to the left of the quail.**\n   - This means the robin must be positioned somewhere to the left of the quail.\n\n5. **The owl is to the right of the crow.**\n   - This means the owl must be positioned somewhere to the right of the crow.\n\n6. **The robin is the fourth from the left.**\n   - This means the robin is in the 4th position from the left.\n\nNow, let's place the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- From condition 6, the robin is in the 4th position.\n- From condition 1, the cardinal is in the 6th position.\n- From condition 2, the hawk is in the 7th position.\n\nThe current arrangement looks like this:\n1. ___\n2. ___\n3. ___\n4. Robin\n5. ___\n6. Cardinal\n7. Hawk\n\nNext, we use conditions 3, 4, and 5 to place the remaining birds (owl, hummingbird, quail, crow):\n\n- From condition 4, the robin is to the left of the quail, so the quail must be in position 5.\n- From condition 5, the owl is to the right of the crow. The only positions left for the crow and owl are 1, 2, and 3. Since the owl must be to the right of the crow, the crow must be in position 1 and the owl in position 3.\n- From condition 3, the owl is to the left of the hummingbird. The only position left for the hummingbird is position 2.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1. Crow\n2. Hummingbird\n3. Owl\n4. Robin\n5. Quail\n6. Cardinal\n7. Hawk\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is the third from the right. The third from the right is position 5, which is occupied by the quail.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
