    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The truck is the oldest.**\n   - This means the truck is in the first position.\n\n2. **The bus is the second-oldest.**\n   - This places the bus in the second position.\n\n3. **The minivan is the third-newest.**\n   - Since there are seven vehicles, the third-newest is the fifth position.\n\n4. **The limousine is the fourth-newest.**\n   - This places the limousine in the fourth position.\n\n5. **The tractor is older than the minivan.**\n   - Since the minivan is in the fifth position, the tractor must be in the third position.\n\n6. **The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the station wagon must be in a position after the hatchback.\n\nNow, let's place the vehicles in order based on the above analysis:\n\n- 1st: Truck (oldest)\n- 2nd: Bus\n- 3rd: Tractor\n- 4th: Limousine\n- 5th: Minivan\n- 6th: Hatchback\n- 7th: Station Wagon (newest)\n\nBased on this order, the station wagon is the newest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
