    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given information:\n\n1. **Peaches are the cheapest.**\n   - This means peaches are in the 1st position.\n\n2. **Apples are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means apples are in the 2nd position.\n\n3. **Loquats are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This means loquats are in the 3rd position.\n\n4. **Plums are the fourth-most expensive.**\n   - Since there are seven fruits, the fourth-most expensive is the 4th position from the top, which is the 4th position from the bottom. Therefore, plums are in the 4th position.\n\n5. **Kiwis are more expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This means kiwis are in a higher position than mangoes.\n\n6. **Oranges are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This means oranges are in a lower position than mangoes.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on the above information:\n\n- 1st: Peaches\n- 2nd: Apples\n- 3rd: Loquats\n- 4th: Plums\n\nWe have three fruits left: kiwis, mangoes, and oranges. We know:\n\n- Kiwis > Mangoes\n- Oranges < Mangoes\n\nSince positions 1 to 4 are already occupied, the remaining positions are 5th, 6th, and 7th. Given the constraints:\n\n- Kiwis must be in a higher position than mangoes, so kiwis cannot be in the 5th position.\n- Oranges must be in a lower position than mangoes, so oranges cannot be in the 7th position.\n\nThus, the only possible arrangement for the remaining fruits is:\n\n- 5th: Oranges\n- 6th: Mangoes\n- 7th: Kiwis\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The oranges are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, oranges are 5th.\n(B) The loquats are the third-cheapest - Correct, loquats are 3rd.\n(C) The apples are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, apples are 2nd.\n(D) The kiwis are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, kiwis are 7th.\n(E) The mangoes are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, mangoes are 6th.\n(F) The plums are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, plums are 4th.\n(G) The peaches are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, peaches are 1st.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
