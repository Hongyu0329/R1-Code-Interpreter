    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The minivan is the oldest.**\n   - This means the minivan is in the first position.\n\n2. **The truck is older than the station wagon.**\n   - This means the truck comes before the station wagon.\n\n3. **The truck is newer than the limousine.**\n   - This means the limousine comes before the truck.\n\n4. **The bus is newer than the convertible.**\n   - This means the convertible comes before the bus.\n\n5. **The bus is older than the tractor.**\n   - This means the bus comes before the tractor.\n\n6. **The limousine is newer than the tractor.**\n   - This means the tractor comes before the limousine.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange these vehicles in order based on the above conditions:\n\n- Start with the minivan as the oldest.\n- The tractor must be older than the limousine, and the limousine must be older than the truck. So, the order involving these three is: Tractor, Limousine, Truck.\n- The bus is older than the tractor, so it must come before the tractor.\n- The convertible is older than the bus, so it must come before the bus.\n- The station wagon is newer than the truck, so it must come after the truck.\n\nPutting it all together, the order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Minivan\n2. Convertible\n3. Bus\n4. Tractor\n5. Limousine\n6. Truck\n7. Station Wagon\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the second-oldest. According to our arrangement, the second-oldest vehicle is the convertible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
