    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The blue jay is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the blue jay is in position 2.\n\n2. **The robin is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the robin is in position 3.\n\n3. **The cardinal is the third from the right.**\n   - Since there are seven birds, the cardinal is in position 5.\n\n4. **The falcon is to the right of the quail.**\n   - This means the quail must be to the left of the falcon.\n\n5. **The raven is to the left of the quail.**\n   - This means the raven must be to the left of the quail.\n\n6. **The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the hummingbird must be to the left of the robin.\n\nNow, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- Position 1: Unknown\n- Position 2: Blue Jay\n- Position 3: Robin\n- Position 4: Unknown\n- Position 5: Cardinal\n- Position 6: Unknown\n- Position 7: Unknown\n\nFrom the conditions, we know:\n- The hummingbird must be in position 1 or 4 because it is to the left of the robin.\n- The raven must be in position 1 or 4 because it is to the left of the quail.\n- The quail must be in position 4, 6, or 7 because it is to the right of the raven and to the left of the falcon.\n- The falcon must be in position 6 or 7 because it is to the right of the quail.\n\nLet's try to fill in the positions:\n\n- If the hummingbird is in position 1, then the raven must be in position 4 (since the raven is to the left of the quail).\n- This places the quail in position 6 and the falcon in position 7.\n\nNow, the order is:\n1. Hummingbird\n2. Blue Jay\n3. Robin\n4. Raven\n5. Cardinal\n6. Quail\n7. Falcon\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n- The blue jay is second.\n- The robin is third.\n- The cardinal is third from the right.\n- The falcon is to the right of the quail.\n- The raven is to the left of the quail.\n- The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n\nTherefore, the leftmost bird is the hummingbird.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<F>>>."
