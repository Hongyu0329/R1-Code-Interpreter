    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Oranges are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is only one fruit cheaper than oranges.\n\n2. **Apples are less expensive than the pears.**\n   - Apples are cheaper than pears.\n\n3. **Mangoes are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - Mangoes have a higher price than cantaloupes.\n\n4. **Mangoes are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This means there are two fruits cheaper than mangoes.\n\n5. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - Watermelons are the second-highest in price.\n\n6. **Loquats are the third-most expensive.**\n   - Loquats are the third-highest in price.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since oranges are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- Mangoes are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- Loquats are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n- Apples are cheaper than pears, so apples must be in position 1, and pears must be in position 4.\n- Cantaloupes must be in position 7 because they are more expensive than mangoes and the only position left.\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Apples\n2. Oranges\n3. Mangoes\n4. Pears\n5. Loquats\n6. Watermelons\n7. Cantaloupes\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The loquats are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, they are third-most expensive.\n(B) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the most expensive.\n(C) The watermelons are the second-most expensive - Correct, as per the arrangement.\n(D) The apples are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the cheapest.\n(E) The oranges are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, they are the second-cheapest.\n(F) The pears are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, they are fourth in the order.\n(G) The mangoes are the second-most expensive - Incorrect, they are third-cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
