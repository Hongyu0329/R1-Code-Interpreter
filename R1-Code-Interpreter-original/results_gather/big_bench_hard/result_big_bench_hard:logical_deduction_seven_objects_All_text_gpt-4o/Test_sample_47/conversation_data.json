    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The brown book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the brown book is in position 7.\n\n2. **The black book is to the right of the white book.**\n   - This means the white book is somewhere to the left of the black book.\n\n3. **The gray book is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the gray book is in position 3.\n\n4. **The orange book is to the right of the gray book.**\n   - Since the gray book is in position 3, the orange book must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n5. **The orange book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the green book is somewhere to the right of the orange book.\n\n6. **The blue book is the third from the right.**\n   - This means the blue book is in position 5.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books based on these conditions:\n\n- Position 7: Brown book (from condition 1)\n- Position 5: Blue book (from condition 6)\n- Position 3: Gray book (from condition 3)\n\nNext, we need to place the orange and green books:\n\n- The orange book must be to the right of the gray book (position 3) and to the left of the green book.\n- The only available positions for the orange book are 4 and 6, but since the blue book is in position 5, the orange book must be in position 4.\n- Therefore, the green book must be in position 6.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Position 3: Gray book\n- Position 4: Orange book\n- Position 5: Blue book\n- Position 6: Green book\n- Position 7: Brown book\n\nFinally, we need to place the black and white books:\n\n- The black book is to the right of the white book (condition 2).\n- The only available positions are 1 and 2.\n- Therefore, the white book must be in position 1, and the black book must be in position 2.\n\nThe final order of the books is:\n\n1. White book\n2. Black book\n3. Gray book\n4. Orange book\n5. Blue book\n6. Green book\n7. Brown book\n\nNow, we check the options to see which book is the second from the right (position 6):\n\n- The green book is in position 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
