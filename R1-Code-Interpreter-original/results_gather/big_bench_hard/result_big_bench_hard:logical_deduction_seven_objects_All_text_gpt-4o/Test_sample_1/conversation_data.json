    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest.**\n   - This means there are three vehicles newer than the station wagon and three vehicles older than it.\n\n2. **The motorcycle is newer than the truck.**\n   - This implies the truck is older than the motorcycle.\n\n3. **The station wagon is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon.\n\n4. **The minivan is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This implies the hatchback is older than the minivan.\n\n5. **The bus is newer than the minivan.**\n   - This means the minivan is older than the bus.\n\n6. **The truck is newer than the limousine.**\n   - This implies the limousine is older than the truck.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these conditions:\n\n- From statement 6, the limousine is the oldest, followed by the truck.\n- From statement 2, the motorcycle is newer than the truck.\n- From statement 1, the station wagon is the fourth-newest, so it is in the middle.\n- From statement 3, the hatchback is newer than the station wagon.\n- From statement 4, the minivan is newer than the hatchback.\n- From statement 5, the bus is newer than the minivan.\n\nArranging these in order from oldest to newest, we get:\n\n1. Limousine\n2. Truck\n3. Motorcycle\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Hatchback\n6. Minivan\n7. Bus\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the third-oldest:\n\n- The first-oldest is the Limousine.\n- The second-oldest is the Truck.\n- The third-oldest is the Motorcycle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
