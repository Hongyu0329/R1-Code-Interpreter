    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The gray book is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the gray book is in position 7.\n\n2. **The brown book is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the brown book is in position 2.\n\n3. **The blue book is to the right of the brown book.**\n   - Since the brown book is in position 2, the blue book must be in a position greater than 2.\n\n4. **The purple book is to the left of the green book.**\n   - This means the purple book must be in a position less than the green book.\n\n5. **The green book is to the left of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the green book must be in a position less than the yellow book.\n\n6. **The purple book is to the right of the blue book.**\n   - This means the purple book must be in a position greater than the blue book.\n\nNow, let's try to place the books in order:\n\n- Position 1: Unknown\n- Position 2: Brown book\n- Position 3: Unknown\n- Position 4: Unknown\n- Position 5: Unknown\n- Position 6: Unknown\n- Position 7: Gray book\n\nFrom the conditions, we know:\n- The blue book is to the right of the brown book, so it can be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n- The purple book is to the right of the blue book, so it must be in a position greater than the blue book.\n- The purple book is to the left of the green book, so it must be in a position less than the green book.\n- The green book is to the left of the yellow book, so it must be in a position less than the yellow book.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n- Since the brown book is in position 2, the blue book can be in position 3.\n- The purple book must be to the right of the blue book, so it can be in position 4.\n- The green book must be to the right of the purple book, so it can be in position 5.\n- The yellow book must be to the right of the green book, so it can be in position 6.\n- The orange book is the only one left, so it must be in position 1.\n\nNow, the order is:\n1. Orange book\n2. Brown book\n3. Blue book\n4. Purple book\n5. Green book\n6. Yellow book\n7. Gray book\n\nThe book that is third from the right is the green book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
