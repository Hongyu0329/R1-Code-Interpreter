    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The mangoes are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive.\n\n2. **The watermelons are less expensive than the plums.**\n   - This implies that plums are more expensive than watermelons.\n\n3. **The watermelons are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This implies that oranges are less expensive than watermelons.\n\n4. **The kiwis are less expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This implies that kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n\n5. **The apples are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - This implies that loquats are less expensive than apples.\n\n6. **The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This implies that mangoes are more expensive than plums.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on these statements:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we have two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n- Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so plums cannot be one of the two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n- Watermelons are less expensive than plums, so watermelons are also less expensive than mangoes.\n- Oranges are less expensive than watermelons, so oranges are less expensive than mangoes.\n- Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis are less expensive than mangoes.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nGiven that mangoes are the third-most expensive, the two fruits more expensive than mangoes must be apples and one other fruit. Since plums, watermelons, oranges, kiwis, and loquats are all less expensive than mangoes, apples must be one of the two most expensive fruits.\n\nTherefore, the only logical arrangement is:\n1. Most expensive: Apples\n2. Second-most expensive: (Another fruit, but not relevant to the options)\n3. Third-most expensive: Mangoes\n4. Fourth-most expensive: Plums\n5. Fifth-most expensive: Watermelons\n6. Sixth-most expensive: Oranges\n7. Least expensive: Kiwis\n\nFrom the options given, the only one that fits is:\n(A) The apples are the most expensive\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
