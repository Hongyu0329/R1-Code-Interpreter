    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Ada finished second-to-last.**  \n   - This means Ada finished in the 6th position.\n\n2. **Mel finished third.**  \n   - This means Mel finished in the 3rd position.\n\n3. **Rob finished fourth.**  \n   - This means Rob finished in the 4th position.\n\n4. **Ada finished above Mya.**  \n   - Since Ada is 6th, Mya must be 7th.\n\n5. **Eli finished below Joe.**  \n   - Eli must be in a position lower than Joe.\n\n6. **Eli finished above Eve.**  \n   - Eli must be in a position higher than Eve.\n\nNow, let's place the golfers in the positions we know:\n\n- 3rd: Mel\n- 4th: Rob\n- 6th: Ada\n- 7th: Mya\n\nThis leaves positions 1, 2, and 5 for Eli, Joe, and Eve. We know:\n\n- Eli is below Joe, so Eli cannot be 1st.\n- Eli is above Eve, so Eli cannot be 5th.\n\nThus, Eli must be 2nd, Joe must be 1st, and Eve must be 5th.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Joe\n2. Eli\n3. Mel\n4. Rob\n5. Eve\n6. Ada\n7. Mya\n\nNow, we need to determine who finished third-to-last, which is the 5th position. In this order, Eve is in the 5th position.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
