    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on the shelf according to the given conditions and then determine which book is fourth from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the fixed positions:**\n   - The purple book is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n   - The black book is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n   - The green book is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5 (since there are 7 books in total).\n\n2. **Determine the relative positions:**\n   - The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n   - The green book is to the left of the orange book.\n   - The orange book is to the left of the gray book.\n\n3. **Arrange the books:**\n   - Start with the known positions: Purple (1), Black (3), Green (5).\n   - The green book (5) is to the left of the orange book, so the orange book must be in position 6 or 7.\n   - The orange book is to the left of the gray book, so the gray book must be in position 7 if the orange book is in position 6.\n   - The brown book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be in position 2, and the brown book must be in position 4.\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - Position 1: Purple\n   - Position 2: Yellow\n   - Position 3: Black\n   - Position 4: Brown\n   - Position 5: Green\n   - Position 6: Orange\n   - Position 7: Gray\n\n5. **Determine the book in the fourth position:**\n   - The brown book is in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the book that is fourth from the left is the brown book.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
