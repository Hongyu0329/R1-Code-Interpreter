    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on the shelf according to the given conditions and determine which book is third from the left. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Books to Arrange**: Red, Purple, Green, White, Orange, Blue, Gray.\n\n2. **Conditions**:\n   - The green book is to the left of the white book.\n   - The red book is to the left of the purple book.\n   - The red book is to the right of the orange book.\n   - The gray book is the second from the left.\n   - The purple book is to the left of the green book.\n   - The blue book is the fourth from the left.\n\n3. **Fixed Positions**:\n   - Gray book is second from the left: _ Gray _ _ _ _ _\n   - Blue book is fourth from the left: _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n\n4. **Analyzing Other Conditions**:\n   - The red book is to the right of the orange book, so Orange must be to the left of Red.\n   - The purple book is to the left of the green book, and the green book is to the left of the white book, so the order is Purple, Green, White.\n   - The red book is to the left of the purple book, so Red must be to the left of Purple.\n\n5. **Filling in the Positions**:\n   - Since Gray is second and Blue is fourth, we have: _ Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n   - The only positions left are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - Orange must be to the left of Red, so Orange cannot be in position 3 (since Red must be to the left of Purple, which is to the left of Green, which is to the left of White).\n   - Therefore, Orange is in position 1: Orange Gray _ Blue _ _ _\n   - Red must be to the right of Orange and to the left of Purple, so Red is in position 3: Orange Gray Red Blue _ _ _\n   - Purple must be to the left of Green, which is to the left of White, so Purple is in position 5: Orange Gray Red Blue Purple _ _\n   - Green is to the left of White, so Green is in position 6: Orange Gray Red Blue Purple Green _\n   - Finally, White is in position 7: Orange Gray Red Blue Purple Green White\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The book that is third from the left is the Red book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
