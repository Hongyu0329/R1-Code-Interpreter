    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The blue jay is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the blue jay is in position 2.\n\n2. **The robin is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the robin is in position 3.\n\n3. **The cardinal is the third from the right.**\n   - Since there are seven positions, the cardinal is in position 5.\n\n4. **The falcon is to the right of the quail.**\n   - This means the quail must be to the left of the falcon.\n\n5. **The raven is to the left of the quail.**\n   - This means the raven must be to the left of the quail.\n\n6. **The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the hummingbird must be to the left of the robin.\n\nNow, let's place the birds based on the above conditions:\n\n- Position 1: Since the blue jay is in position 2 and the robin is in position 3, the hummingbird must be in position 1 (to the left of the robin).\n\n- Position 2: Blue jay (as given).\n\n- Position 3: Robin (as given).\n\n- Position 4: The raven must be to the left of the quail, and the quail must be to the left of the falcon. Therefore, the raven is in position 4.\n\n- Position 5: Cardinal (as given).\n\n- Position 6: The quail must be to the left of the falcon, so the quail is in position 6.\n\n- Position 7: Falcon (since it is to the right of the quail).\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n1. Hummingbird\n2. Blue jay\n3. Robin\n4. Raven\n5. Cardinal\n6. Quail\n7. Falcon\n\nThe rightmost bird, in position 7, is the falcon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
