    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given conditions and identify which vehicle is the fourth-newest.\n\n1. **Identify the fixed position:**\n   - The station wagon is the fourth-newest.\n\n2. **Analyze the relative positions:**\n   - The motorcycle is newer than the truck.\n   - The station wagon is older than the hatchback.\n   - The minivan is newer than the hatchback.\n   - The bus is newer than the minivan.\n   - The truck is newer than the limousine.\n\n3. **Determine the order:**\n   - Since the station wagon is the fourth-newest, it is in the middle of the order.\n   - The hatchback must be newer than the station wagon, so it is positioned after the station wagon.\n   - The minivan is newer than the hatchback, so it is positioned after the hatchback.\n   - The bus is newer than the minivan, so it is positioned after the minivan.\n   - The motorcycle is newer than the truck, so it is positioned after the truck.\n   - The truck is newer than the limousine, so it is positioned after the limousine.\n\n4. **Construct the order from newest to oldest:**\n   - The bus is the newest.\n   - The minivan is next.\n   - The hatchback follows.\n   - The station wagon is fourth-newest.\n   - The motorcycle is next.\n   - The truck follows.\n   - The limousine is the oldest.\n\n5. **Verify the position of the station wagon:**\n   - The station wagon is indeed the fourth-newest in this order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
