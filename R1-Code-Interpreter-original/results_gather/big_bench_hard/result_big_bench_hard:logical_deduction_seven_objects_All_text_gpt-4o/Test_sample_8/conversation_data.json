    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The convertible is the second-oldest.**\n   - This means there is one vehicle older than the convertible.\n\n2. **The tractor is the fourth-newest.**\n   - This implies there are three vehicles newer than the tractor.\n\n3. **The minivan is older than the truck.**\n   - This means the truck cannot be older than the minivan.\n\n4. **The truck is older than the limousine.**\n   - This means the limousine cannot be older than the truck.\n\n5. **The hatchback is the third-oldest.**\n   - This means there are two vehicles older than the hatchback.\n\n6. **The bus is newer than the limousine.**\n   - This means the limousine cannot be the newest.\n\nNow, let's try to place these vehicles in order:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it must be in position 2.\n- The hatchback is the third-oldest, so it must be in position 3.\n- The tractor is the fourth-newest, which means it is in position 4.\n- The minivan is older than the truck, and the truck is older than the limousine. Therefore, the order among these three must be: minivan, truck, limousine.\n- The bus is newer than the limousine, so it must be in the last position.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's place the vehicles:\n\n1. Oldest: ?\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Tractor\n5. Minivan\n6. Truck\n7. Limousine\n8. Newest: Bus\n\nThe only vehicle not yet placed is the oldest one. Based on the options, the minivan is the only vehicle that can logically be the oldest, as it fits all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the minivan is the oldest.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<C>>>."
