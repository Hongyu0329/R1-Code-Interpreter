    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on a shelf according to the given conditions and determine which book is the leftmost.\n\n1. **Identify the positions based on the given conditions:**\n   - There are seven books: white, gray, yellow, purple, red, black, and green.\n   - The black book is the second from the right. This means it is in position 6.\n   - The gray book is the third from the right. This means it is in position 5.\n   - The red book is the second from the left. This means it is in position 2.\n   - The yellow book is the third from the left. This means it is in position 3.\n   - The white book is the fourth from the left. This means it is in position 4.\n   - The red book is to the left of the green book.\n\n2. **Arrange the books based on the positions:**\n   - Position 1: Unknown\n   - Position 2: Red book\n   - Position 3: Yellow book\n   - Position 4: White book\n   - Position 5: Gray book\n   - Position 6: Black book\n   - Position 7: Unknown\n\n3. **Determine the remaining books:**\n   - The books that have not been placed yet are the purple book and the green book.\n   - The red book is to the left of the green book, so the green book cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the green book must be in position 7.\n   - This leaves the purple book to be in position 1.\n\n4. **Final arrangement:**\n   - Position 1: Purple book\n   - Position 2: Red book\n   - Position 3: Yellow book\n   - Position 4: White book\n   - Position 5: Gray book\n   - Position 6: Black book\n   - Position 7: Green book\n\n5. **Determine the leftmost book:**\n   - The leftmost book is in position 1, which is the purple book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
