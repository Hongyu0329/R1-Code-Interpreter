    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The watermelons are less expensive than the plums.**\n   - This means: Watermelons < Plums\n\n2. **The watermelons are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means: Oranges < Watermelons\n\n3. **The kiwis are less expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means: Kiwis < Oranges\n\n4. **The apples are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - This means: Loquats < Apples\n\n5. **The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This means: Plums < Mangoes\n\n6. **The mangoes are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This means: Mangoes are in the third position when ordered by price.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we place them in the third position.\n- From statement 5, plums are less expensive than mangoes, so plums cannot be in the first or second position. They must be in the fourth position or lower.\n- From statement 1, watermelons are less expensive than plums, so watermelons must be in the fifth position or lower.\n- From statement 2, watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges must be in the sixth position or lower.\n- From statement 3, kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis must be in the seventh position.\n- From statement 4, apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats must be in the sixth position or lower.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the fruits:\n\n1. **Most expensive:** Apples\n2. **Second-most expensive:** Plums\n3. **Third-most expensive:** Mangoes\n4. **Fourth-most expensive:** Watermelons\n5. **Fifth-most expensive:** Oranges\n6. **Sixth-most expensive:** Loquats\n7. **Least expensive:** Kiwis\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the mangoes are indeed the third-most expensive.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
