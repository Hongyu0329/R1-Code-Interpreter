    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Eve finished first.**\n   - Eve is in position 1.\n\n2. **Joe finished third.**\n   - Joe is in position 3.\n\n3. **Dan finished last.**\n   - Dan is in position 7.\n\n4. **Rob finished third-to-last.**\n   - Rob is in position 5.\n\n5. **Mel finished below Rob.**\n   - Since Rob is in position 5, Mel must be in position 6 or 7. But Dan is already in position 7, so Mel must be in position 6.\n\n6. **Ada finished above Joe.**\n   - Joe is in position 3, so Ada must be in position 2.\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions based on the above analysis:\n\n1. Eve\n2. Ada\n3. Joe\n4. Amy (since this is the only position left for Amy)\n5. Rob\n6. Mel\n7. Dan\n\nNow, let's check the options to see who finished last:\n\n- (A) Amy finished last: Incorrect, Amy finished 4th.\n- (B) Eve finished last: Incorrect, Eve finished 1st.\n- (C) Ada finished last: Incorrect, Ada finished 2nd.\n- (D) Rob finished last: Incorrect, Rob finished 5th.\n- (E) Dan finished last: Correct, Dan finished 7th.\n- (F) Mel finished last: Incorrect, Mel finished 6th.\n- (G) Joe finished last: Incorrect, Joe finished 3rd.\n\nThe correct answer is option (E).\n\n<<<E>>>"
