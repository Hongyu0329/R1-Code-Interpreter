    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Dan finished third.**\n   - This means Dan is in position 3.\n\n2. **Ana finished above Ada.**\n   - Ana's position is less than Ada's position.\n\n3. **Amy finished last.**\n   - Amy is in position 7.\n\n4. **Dan finished below Rob.**\n   - Since Dan is in position 3, Rob must be in position 1 or 2.\n\n5. **Eve finished below Ada.**\n   - Eve's position is greater than Ada's position.\n\n6. **Rob finished below Joe.**\n   - Since Rob is in position 1 or 2, Joe must be in position 1 if Rob is in position 2, or Joe is in position 2 if Rob is in position 1.\n\nNow, let's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n- **Position 1 and 2:** Since Rob finished below Joe, Joe must be in position 1 and Rob in position 2.\n\n- **Position 3:** Dan is already placed here.\n\n- **Position 4, 5, 6:** Ana, Ada, and Eve need to be placed here. Ana must be above Ada, and Eve must be below Ada. Therefore, Ana is in position 4, Ada in position 5, and Eve in position 6.\n\n- **Position 7:** Amy is already placed here.\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Joe\n2. Rob\n3. Dan\n4. Ana\n5. Ada\n6. Eve\n7. Amy\n\nNow, we need to determine who finished third-to-last, which is position 5.\n\n- **Position 5:** Ada\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Ada finished third-to-last.\n\n<<<C>>>"
