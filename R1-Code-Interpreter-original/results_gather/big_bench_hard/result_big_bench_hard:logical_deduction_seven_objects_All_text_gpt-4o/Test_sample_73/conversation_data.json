    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The pears are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is one fruit cheaper than pears.\n\n2. **The peaches are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**\n   - This means cantaloupes are cheaper than peaches.\n\n3. **The peaches are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This means mangoes are more expensive than peaches.\n\n4. **The cantaloupes are more expensive than the kiwis.**\n   - This means kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n\n5. **The oranges are the fourth-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are three fruits cheaper than oranges and three fruits more expensive than oranges.\n\n6. **The watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, they are in position 6.\n- Since oranges are the fourth-most expensive, they are in position 4.\n- Since pears are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- Since peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes and less expensive than mangoes, and given the positions of watermelons and oranges, peaches can be in position 5, cantaloupes in position 3, and mangoes in position 7.\n- Since cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis, kiwis must be in position 1.\n\nArranging them, we have:\n1. Kiwis\n2. Pears\n3. Cantaloupes\n4. Oranges\n5. Peaches\n6. Watermelons\n7. Mangoes\n\nFrom this arrangement, the cheapest fruit is the kiwis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"
