    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The blue jay is the leftmost.**\n   - This means the blue jay is in the first position.\n\n2. **The cardinal is the fourth from the left.**\n   - This places the cardinal in the fourth position.\n\n3. **The owl is the third from the left.**\n   - This places the owl in the third position.\n\n4. **The raven is the third from the right.**\n   - Since there are seven birds, the raven is in the fifth position.\n\n5. **The hummingbird is to the left of the quail.**\n   - This means the hummingbird must be placed in a position that is to the left of wherever the quail is placed.\n\n6. **The robin is to the left of the cardinal.**\n   - Since the cardinal is in the fourth position, the robin must be in either the first, second, or third position. However, the first and third positions are already occupied by the blue jay and the owl, respectively. Therefore, the robin must be in the second position.\n\nNow, let's place the birds based on the above analysis:\n\n- 1st: Blue Jay\n- 2nd: Robin\n- 3rd: Owl\n- 4th: Cardinal\n- 5th: Raven\n\nThis leaves the 6th and 7th positions for the hummingbird and the quail. Since the hummingbird must be to the left of the quail, the hummingbird will be in the 6th position and the quail in the 7th position.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Owl\n4. Cardinal\n5. Raven\n6. Hummingbird\n7. Quail\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is the second from the right. In this arrangement, the second from the right is the hummingbird.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
