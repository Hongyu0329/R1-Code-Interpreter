    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, from cheapest to most expensive, using the given clues.\n\n1. **Identify the cheapest fruit:**\n   - The watermelons are the cheapest.\n\n2. **Identify the third-cheapest fruit:**\n   - The kiwis are the third-cheapest.\n\n3. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\n4. **Identify the fruit more expensive than cantaloupes:**\n   - The oranges are more expensive than the cantaloupes, so they must be the most expensive.\n\n5. **Identify the relationship between peaches, mangoes, and plums:**\n   - The peaches are more expensive than the mangoes.\n   - The peaches are less expensive than the plums.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on the information:\n\n- **Cheapest:** Watermelons\n- **Third-cheapest:** Kiwis\n- **Second-most expensive:** Cantaloupes\n- **Most expensive:** Oranges\n\nGiven these positions, we need to place the remaining fruits: mangoes, peaches, and plums.\n\n- Since peaches are more expensive than mangoes, mangoes must be cheaper than peaches.\n- Since peaches are less expensive than plums, plums must be more expensive than peaches.\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Watermelons\n2. Mangoes\n3. Kiwis\n4. Peaches\n5. Plums\n6. Cantaloupes\n7. Oranges\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the third-most expensive:\n- The third-most expensive fruit in this order is the peaches.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
