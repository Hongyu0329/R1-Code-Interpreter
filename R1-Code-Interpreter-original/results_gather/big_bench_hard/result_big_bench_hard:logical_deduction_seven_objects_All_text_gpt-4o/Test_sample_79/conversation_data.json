    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books according to the given conditions and identify which book is the leftmost.\n\n1. **Identify the positions based on the given conditions:**\n   - There are seven books: black, orange, yellow, white, blue, red, and green.\n   - The orange book is the leftmost. This is a direct statement from the problem.\n\n2. **Analyze the conditions:**\n   - The red book is to the right of the yellow book.\n   - The white book is the second from the right.\n   - The red book is to the left of the green book.\n   - The blue book is to the right of the black book.\n   - The black book is the third from the right.\n\n3. **Determine the positions:**\n   - Since the black book is the third from the right, the positions from the right are: \n     - 1st from the right: Unknown\n     - 2nd from the right: White book\n     - 3rd from the right: Black book\n   - The blue book is to the right of the black book, so the blue book must be the 1st from the right.\n\n4. **Fill in the remaining positions:**\n   - The orange book is the leftmost, so it is in the 1st position from the left.\n   - The red book is to the right of the yellow book and to the left of the green book. Since the white and black books are already placed, the red, yellow, and green books must be in the remaining positions (2nd, 3rd, and 4th from the left).\n\n5. **Arrange the books:**\n   - 1st from the left: Orange book\n   - 2nd from the left: Yellow book\n   - 3rd from the left: Red book\n   - 4th from the left: Green book\n   - 5th from the left: Black book\n   - 6th from the left: White book\n   - 7th from the left: Blue book\n\n6. **Verify the conditions:**\n   - The red book is to the right of the yellow book: Correct.\n   - The white book is the second from the right: Correct.\n   - The red book is to the left of the green book: Correct.\n   - The blue book is to the right of the black book: Correct.\n   - The black book is the third from the right: Correct.\n   - The orange book is the leftmost: Correct.\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the conditions, and the orange book is indeed the leftmost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
