    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **The hatchback is newer than the truck.**\n   - This means the truck is older than the hatchback.\n\n2. **The sedan is the third-newest.**\n   - This places the sedan in the 5th position from the oldest.\n\n3. **The station wagon is the newest.**\n   - This places the station wagon in the 7th position from the oldest.\n\n4. **The motorcycle is older than the truck.**\n   - This means the motorcycle is in a position before the truck.\n\n5. **The minivan is newer than the sedan.**\n   - This places the minivan in a position after the sedan, which is in the 5th position.\n\n6. **The tractor is the third-oldest.**\n   - This places the tractor in the 3rd position from the oldest.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these clues:\n\n- **Oldest to Newest:**\n  1. **Oldest:** Unknown\n  2. **Second-oldest:** Unknown\n  3. **Third-oldest:** Tractor\n  4. **Fourth-oldest:** Unknown\n  5. **Fifth-oldest (Third-newest):** Sedan\n  6. **Sixth-oldest:** Minivan (since it is newer than the sedan)\n  7. **Seventh-oldest (Newest):** Station Wagon\n\nFrom the above arrangement, we know:\n- The motorcycle is older than the truck, so the motorcycle must be in one of the first two positions.\n- The truck is older than the hatchback, so the truck must be in one of the first four positions.\n- The hatchback must be in one of the positions after the truck.\n\nLet's fill in the remaining positions:\n- Since the motorcycle is older than the truck, and the truck is older than the hatchback, a possible arrangement is:\n  1. **Oldest:** Motorcycle\n  2. **Second-oldest:** Truck\n  3. **Third-oldest:** Tractor\n  4. **Fourth-oldest:** Hatchback\n  5. **Fifth-oldest (Third-newest):** Sedan\n  6. **Sixth-oldest:** Minivan\n  7. **Seventh-oldest (Newest):** Station Wagon\n\nNow, let's check the options for the second-newest:\n- The second-newest position corresponds to the sixth-oldest position, which is the minivan.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
