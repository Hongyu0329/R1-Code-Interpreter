    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. Joe finished first.\n   - Order: Joe, _, _, _, _, _, _\n\n2. Mel finished second-to-last.\n   - Order: Joe, _, _, _, _, Mel, _\n\n3. Rob finished above Eve.\n   - Since Eve finished fourth, Rob must be in one of the first three positions.\n   - Order: Joe, _, Rob, Eve, _, Mel, _\n\n4. Mel finished above Eli.\n   - Since Mel is second-to-last, Eli must be last.\n   - Order: Joe, _, Rob, Eve, _, Mel, Eli\n\n5. Rob finished below Ada.\n   - Ada must be in one of the first three positions, and Rob must be below her.\n   - Order: Joe, Ada, Rob, Eve, _, Mel, Eli\n\nNow, we need to determine who finished third. The only position left is the fifth position, which must be filled by Ana.\n\nFinal order: Joe, Ada, Rob, Eve, Ana, Mel, Eli\n\nFrom this order, we can see that Ada finished third.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
