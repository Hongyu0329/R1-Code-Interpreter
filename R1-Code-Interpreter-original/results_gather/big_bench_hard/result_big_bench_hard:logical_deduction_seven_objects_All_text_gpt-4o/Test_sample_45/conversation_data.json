    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The black book is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the black book is in position 2.\n\n2. **The white book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This means the orange book is to the left of the white book.\n\n3. **The black book is to the right of the brown book.**\n   - Since the black book is in position 2, the brown book must be in position 1.\n\n4. **The yellow book is the third from the right.**\n   - Since there are seven books, the yellow book is in position 5.\n\n5. **The purple book is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the purple book is in position 3.\n\n6. **The orange book is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the orange book is in position 6.\n\nNow, let's place the books based on the above conditions:\n\n- Position 1: Brown book (from condition 3)\n- Position 2: Black book (from condition 1)\n- Position 3: Purple book (from condition 5)\n- Position 4: (unknown)\n- Position 5: Yellow book (from condition 4)\n- Position 6: Orange book (from condition 6)\n- Position 7: (unknown)\n\nFrom condition 2, the white book must be to the right of the orange book, so the white book must be in position 7.\n\nThis leaves position 4 for the blue book.\n\nThe final order of the books is:\n1. Brown\n2. Black\n3. Purple\n4. Blue\n5. Yellow\n6. Orange\n7. White\n\nNow, we need to determine which book is the leftmost:\n\n- The leftmost book is in position 1, which is the brown book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
