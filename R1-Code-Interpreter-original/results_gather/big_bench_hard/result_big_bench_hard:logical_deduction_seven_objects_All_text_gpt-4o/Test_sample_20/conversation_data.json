    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The owl is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the owl is in the 6th position.\n\n2. **The cardinal is the fourth from the left.**\n   - This places the cardinal in the 4th position.\n\n3. **The falcon is to the left of the blue jay.**\n   - This means the falcon must be positioned somewhere to the left of the blue jay.\n\n4. **The quail is to the left of the falcon.**\n   - This means the quail must be positioned somewhere to the left of the falcon.\n\n5. **The raven is the second from the left.**\n   - This places the raven in the 2nd position.\n\n6. **The robin is to the left of the quail.**\n   - This means the robin must be positioned somewhere to the left of the quail.\n\nNow, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- We know the owl is in the 6th position and the cardinal is in the 4th position.\n- The raven is in the 2nd position.\n\nLet's consider the remaining positions: 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th.\n\n- Since the falcon is to the left of the blue jay, and the quail is to the left of the falcon, and the robin is to the left of the quail, the only way to satisfy all these conditions is:\n  - Robin in the 1st position\n  - Quail in the 3rd position\n  - Falcon in the 5th position\n  - Blue Jay in the 7th position\n\nThus, the order from left to right is:\n1. Robin\n2. Raven\n3. Quail\n4. Cardinal\n5. Falcon\n6. Owl\n7. Blue Jay\n\nNow, we need to determine which bird is the second from the right. According to our arrangement, the second from the right is the owl.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
