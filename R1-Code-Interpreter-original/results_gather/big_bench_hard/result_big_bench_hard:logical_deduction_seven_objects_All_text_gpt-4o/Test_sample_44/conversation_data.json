    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. \"The motorcycle is older than the minivan.\"\n   - Motorcycle > Minivan\n\n2. \"The minivan is older than the tractor.\"\n   - Minivan > Tractor\n\n3. \"The bus is newer than the truck.\"\n   - Truck > Bus\n\n4. \"The station wagon is the third-newest.\"\n   - This means there are two vehicles newer than the station wagon.\n\n5. \"The sedan is older than the truck.\"\n   - Sedan > Truck\n\n6. \"The tractor is older than the sedan.\"\n   - Tractor > Sedan\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to find the order:\n\n- From statements 1 and 2: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor\n- From statement 6: Tractor > Sedan\n- Combining the above: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan\n- From statement 5: Sedan > Truck\n- Combining the above: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan > Truck\n- From statement 3: Truck > Bus\n- Combining the above: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan > Truck > Bus\n- From statement 4: The station wagon is the third-newest, so it must be between the truck and the bus.\n- Final order: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan > Station Wagon > Truck > Bus\n\nNow, let's determine which vehicle is the oldest:\n\n- The motorcycle is the first in the order, making it the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
