    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The green book is to the left of the purple book.**\n   - This means the order is: Green (G) < Purple (P).\n\n2. **The white book is to the right of the orange book.**\n   - This means the order is: Orange (O) < White (W).\n\n3. **The green book is to the right of the brown book.**\n   - This means the order is: Brown (B) < Green (G).\n\n4. **The yellow book is to the right of the white book.**\n   - This means the order is: White (W) < Yellow (Y).\n\n5. **The red book is to the right of the yellow book.**\n   - This means the order is: Yellow (Y) < Red (R).\n\n6. **The brown book is to the right of the red book.**\n   - This means the order is: Red (R) < Brown (B).\n\nNow, let's combine these conditions to find the complete order:\n\n- From conditions 3 and 6: Red (R) < Brown (B) < Green (G).\n- From condition 1: Green (G) < Purple (P).\n- From conditions 2 and 4: Orange (O) < White (W) < Yellow (Y).\n- From condition 5: Yellow (Y) < Red (R).\n\nCombining all these, we get the order:\nOrange (O) < White (W) < Yellow (Y) < Red (R) < Brown (B) < Green (G) < Purple (P).\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which book is the rightmost:\n\n- (A) The orange book is the rightmost: No, Orange is the leftmost.\n- (B) The red book is the rightmost: No, Red is not the rightmost.\n- (C) The green book is the rightmost: No, Green is not the rightmost.\n- (D) The white book is the rightmost: No, White is not the rightmost.\n- (E) The purple book is the rightmost: Yes, Purple is the rightmost.\n- (F) The brown book is the rightmost: No, Brown is not the rightmost.\n- (G) The yellow book is the rightmost: No, Yellow is not the rightmost.\n\nThe correct answer is that the purple book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<E>>>"
