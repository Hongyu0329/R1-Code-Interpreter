    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Rob finished second.**\n   - This is a direct statement, so Rob is in the 2nd position.\n\n2. **Rob finished above Eve.**\n   - Since Rob is 2nd, Eve must be 3rd or lower.\n\n3. **Joe finished above Ada.**\n   - Joe's position is higher than Ada's.\n\n4. **Joe finished below Eve.**\n   - Since Joe is below Eve, and Eve is below Rob, Joe must be 4th or lower.\n\n5. **Ada finished above Ana.**\n   - Ada's position is higher than Ana's.\n\n6. **Eli finished third-to-last.**\n   - In a list of seven, the third-to-last position is the 5th position. So, Eli is 5th.\n\nNow, let's try to place the golfers in order based on these conditions:\n\n- **Rob is 2nd.**\n- **Eli is 5th.**\n- **Eve must be above Joe and below Rob, so Eve is 3rd.**\n- **Joe is below Eve, so Joe is 4th.**\n- **Ada is above Ana, and the only positions left are 1st, 6th, and 7th.**\n- **Since Eli is 5th, and Ada is above Ana, Ada must be 6th, and Ana must be 7th.**\n- **The only position left is 1st, which must be Amy.**\n\nThe final order is:\n1. Amy\n2. Rob\n3. Eve\n4. Joe\n5. Eli\n6. Ada\n7. Ana\n\nBased on this order, the golfer who finished second is Rob.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
