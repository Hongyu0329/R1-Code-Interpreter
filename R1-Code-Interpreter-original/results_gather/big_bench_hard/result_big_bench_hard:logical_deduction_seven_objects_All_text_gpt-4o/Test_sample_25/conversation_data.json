    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in order based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The falcon is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the falcon is in position 2.\n\n2. **The crow is the rightmost.**\n   - This means the crow is in position 7.\n\n3. **The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.**\n   - This means the blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.\n\n4. **The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the hummingbird is to the left of the hawk.\n\n5. **The blue jay is to the right of the owl.**\n   - This means the owl is to the left of the blue jay.\n\n6. **The raven is to the left of the falcon.**\n   - This means the raven is in position 1.\n\nNow, let's place the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- Position 1: Raven (from condition 6)\n- Position 2: Falcon (from condition 1)\n- Position 7: Crow (from condition 2)\n\nNext, we need to place the remaining birds: blue jay, owl, hummingbird, and hawk.\n\n- The owl must be to the left of the blue jay (condition 5).\n- The blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird (condition 3).\n- The hummingbird must be to the left of the hawk (condition 4).\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n- Position 3: Owl (since it must be to the left of the blue jay)\n- Position 4: Blue Jay (since it must be to the right of the owl and to the left of the hummingbird)\n- Position 5: Hummingbird (since it must be to the right of the blue jay and to the left of the hawk)\n- Position 6: Hawk (since it must be to the right of the hummingbird)\n\nNow, the order of the birds is:\n1. Raven\n2. Falcon\n3. Owl\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n6. Hawk\n7. Crow\n\nThe question asks which bird is fourth from the left. Based on our arrangement, the blue jay is fourth from the left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
