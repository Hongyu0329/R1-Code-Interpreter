    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **The cardinal is the second from the right.**\n   - This means the cardinal is in the 6th position.\n\n2. **The quail is the third from the right.**\n   - This means the quail is in the 5th position.\n\n3. **The crow is to the right of the cardinal.**\n   - Since the cardinal is in the 6th position, the crow must be in the 7th position.\n\n4. **The owl is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the owl is in the 2nd position.\n\n5. **The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.**\n   - This means the hummingbird must be positioned somewhere to the left of the falcon.\n\n6. **The falcon is to the left of the robin.**\n   - This means the falcon must be positioned somewhere to the left of the robin.\n\nNow, let's place the birds based on the above conditions:\n\n- The cardinal is in the 6th position.\n- The quail is in the 5th position.\n- The crow is in the 7th position.\n- The owl is in the 2nd position.\n\nThis leaves the 1st, 3rd, and 4th positions open for the robin, falcon, and hummingbird. \n\nGiven that the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon, and the falcon is to the left of the robin, the only possible arrangement for these three birds is:\n\n- Hummingbird in the 1st position\n- Falcon in the 3rd position\n- Robin in the 4th position\n\nNow, let's verify the complete arrangement:\n1. Hummingbird\n2. Owl\n3. Falcon\n4. Robin\n5. Quail\n6. Cardinal\n7. Crow\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Now, we need to determine which bird is the fourth from the left:\n\n- The bird in the 4th position is the Robin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
