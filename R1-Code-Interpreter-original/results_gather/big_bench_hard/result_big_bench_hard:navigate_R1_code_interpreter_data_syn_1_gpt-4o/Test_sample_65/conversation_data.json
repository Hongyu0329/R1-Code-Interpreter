    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the net movement from the starting point after following the given instructions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 7 steps forward: This moves you to position 7.\n3. Take 3 steps backward: This moves you to position 4 (7 - 3 = 4).\n4. Take 4 steps backward: This moves you to position 0 (4 - 4 = 0).\n\nNow, let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 7 steps forward\nposition += 7\n\n# Take 3 steps backward\nposition -= 3\n\n# Take 4 steps backward\nposition -= 4\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can determine if the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\n<<<Yes>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and returned \"Yes,\" which means that after following the given instructions, you do return to the starting point. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
