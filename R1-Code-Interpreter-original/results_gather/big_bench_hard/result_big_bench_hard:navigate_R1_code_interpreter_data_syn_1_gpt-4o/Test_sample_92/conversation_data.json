    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the directions and movements described:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at a certain point, facing forward.\n2. **Take 6 steps left**: This means we turn 90 degrees to the left from our initial forward direction and take 6 steps.\n3. **Take 3 steps backward**: From the current position, we move 3 steps in the opposite direction of where we are currently facing.\n4. **Take 3 steps left**: We turn 90 degrees to the left again from our current direction and take 3 steps.\n\nThe question is whether we return to the starting point after these movements.\n\nTo solve this, we can simulate the movements on a coordinate plane, assuming:\n- Starting point is at the origin (0, 0).\n- Initial direction is along the positive y-axis (facing forward).\n\nLet's simulate these movements using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial position and direction\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = 'N'  # N for North, E for East, S for South, W for West\n\n# Function to update position based on direction and steps\ndef move(x, y, direction, steps):\n    if direction == 'N':\n        y += steps\n    elif direction == 'E':\n        x += steps\n    elif direction == 'S':\n        y -= steps\n    elif direction == 'W':\n        x -= steps\n    return x, y\n\n# Function to turn left\ndef turn_left(direction):\n    if direction == 'N':\n        return 'W'\n    elif direction == 'W':\n        return 'S'\n    elif direction == 'S':\n        return 'E'\n    elif direction == 'E':\n        return 'N'\n\n# Execute the movements\n# 1. Take 6 steps left\ndirection = turn_left(direction)\nx, y = move(x, y, direction, 6)\n\n# 2. Take 3 steps backward\n# Backward is opposite to the current direction\nif direction == 'N':\n    x, y = move(x, y, 'S', 3)\nelif direction == 'E':\n    x, y = move(x, y, 'W', 3)\nelif direction == 'S':\n    x, y = move(x, y, 'N', 3)\nelif direction == 'W':\n    x, y = move(x, y, 'E', 3)\n\n# 3. Take 3 steps left\ndirection = turn_left(direction)\nx, y = move(x, y, direction, 3)\n\n# Check if we are back at the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if we return to the starting point.",
    "The code execution indicates that the final position is not the starting point, which means the answer to the question is \"No.\" \n\nThe movements and turns were correctly simulated, and the final position was checked against the starting point. Since the output is \"No,\" it confirms that the described movements do not lead back to the starting point.\n\n<<<No>>>"
