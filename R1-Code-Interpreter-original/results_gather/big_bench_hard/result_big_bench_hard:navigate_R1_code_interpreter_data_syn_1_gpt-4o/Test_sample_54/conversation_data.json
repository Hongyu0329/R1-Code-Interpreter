    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the instructions given and determine if we return to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. Start at the origin point (0, 0).\n2. Turn right and take 3 steps.\n3. Turn around and take 3 steps.\n4. Turn left.\n\nWe need to track the position and direction at each step. Let's assume the initial direction is \"north\" (upwards on a 2D plane).\n\n- Turning right from north means facing east.\n- Taking 3 steps east moves us to (3, 0).\n- Turning around from east means facing west.\n- Taking 3 steps west moves us back to (0, 0).\n- Turning left from west means facing south.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to verify the final position.\n\n```python\n# Initial position and direction\nposition = [0, 0]\ndirection = 'north'\n\n# Define direction changes\nright_turns = {'north': 'east', 'east': 'south', 'south': 'west', 'west': 'north'}\nleft_turns = {'north': 'west', 'west': 'south', 'south': 'east', 'east': 'north'}\nopposite_directions = {'north': 'south', 'south': 'north', 'east': 'west', 'west': 'east'}\n\n# Define movement vectors\nmovement_vectors = {'north': (0, 1), 'south': (0, -1), 'east': (1, 0), 'west': (-1, 0)}\n\n# Turn right and take 3 steps\ndirection = right_turns[direction]\nposition[0] += 3 * movement_vectors[direction][0]\nposition[1] += 3 * movement_vectors[direction][1]\n\n# Turn around and take 3 steps\ndirection = opposite_directions[direction]\nposition[0] += 3 * movement_vectors[direction][0]\nposition[1] += 3 * movement_vectors[direction][1]\n\n# Turn left\ndirection = left_turns[direction]\n\n# Check if we are back at the starting point\nis_at_starting_point = (position == [0, 0])\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if is_at_starting_point else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if we return to the starting point.",
    "The code execution confirms that following the given instructions returns us to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
