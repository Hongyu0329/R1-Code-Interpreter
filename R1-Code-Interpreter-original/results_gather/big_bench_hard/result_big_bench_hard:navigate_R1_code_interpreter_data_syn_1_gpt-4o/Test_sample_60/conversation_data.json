    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the sequence of steps described will return us to the starting point. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Take 6 steps**: This moves us 6 steps away from the starting point.\n2. **Take 2 steps**: This moves us an additional 2 steps away, totaling 8 steps from the starting point.\n3. **Take 6 steps**: This moves us another 6 steps away, totaling 14 steps from the starting point.\n\nThe question is asking if these steps will return us to the starting point. To return to the starting point, the net movement should be zero. However, in this case, we are moving further away with each step.\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to simulate this and check if the final position is the starting point (position 0).\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Steps\nsteps = [6, 2, 6]\n\n# Simulate the steps\nfor step in steps:\n    position += step\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nprint(\"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to determine the final answer.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence of steps does not return to the starting point. The reasoning is that each step moves further away from the starting point, resulting in a net movement away from the origin.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
