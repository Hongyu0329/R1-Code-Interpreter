    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the described actions result in returning to the starting point. The actions are as follows:\n\n1. Take 8 steps in one direction.\n2. Turn around.\n3. Take 8 steps in the opposite direction.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- Initially, you take 8 steps in one direction. Let's assume this is the positive direction on a number line.\n- Turning around means you will now face the opposite direction, which is the negative direction on the number line.\n- Taking 8 steps in the negative direction will bring you back to the starting point.\n\nTo verify this, we can use a simple calculation:\n\n1. Start at position 0.\n2. Move 8 steps forward: 0 + 8 = 8.\n3. Turn around and move 8 steps backward: 8 - 8 = 0.\n\nThe final position is 0, which is the starting point.\n\nNow, let's write a simple Python script to simulate this process and confirm the result.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 8 steps forward\nposition += 8\n\n# Turn around and take 8 steps backward\nposition -= 8\n\n# Output the final position\nprint(position)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm whether the final position is the starting point (0).\n\nAfter running the code, we can conclude the final answer.",
    "The code output confirms that the final position is 0, which is the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
