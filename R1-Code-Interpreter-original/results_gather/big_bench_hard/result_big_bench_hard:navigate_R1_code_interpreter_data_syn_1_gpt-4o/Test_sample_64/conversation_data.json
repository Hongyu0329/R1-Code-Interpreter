    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the instructions given and determine if we end up at the starting point.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) on a 2D plane.\n2. **Initial Direction**: Assume the initial direction is facing \"north\" (upwards on the y-axis).\n\n**Instructions**:\n- \"Turn left\": This means changing direction counterclockwise. From north, turning left would face us west (left on the x-axis).\n- \"Take 4 steps\": Move 4 units in the current direction.\n- \"Turn around\": This means changing direction to the opposite. If facing west, turning around would face us east (right on the x-axis).\n- \"Take 4 steps\": Move 4 units in the current direction.\n\nLet's simulate these steps:\n\n1. Start at (0, 0), facing north.\n2. Turn left: Now facing west.\n3. Take 4 steps: Move 4 units west to (-4, 0).\n4. Turn around: Now facing east.\n5. Take 4 steps: Move 4 units east to (0, 0).\n\nAfter executing these instructions, we end up at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to verify:\n\n```python\n# Initial position and direction\nposition = [0, 0]\ndirection = 'north'\n\n# Define direction changes\ndirections = ['north', 'west', 'south', 'east']\ndirection_index = directions.index(direction)\n\n# Turn left\ndirection_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4\ndirection = directions[direction_index]\n\n# Take 4 steps\nif direction == 'north':\n    position[1] += 4\nelif direction == 'south':\n    position[1] -= 4\nelif direction == 'east':\n    position[0] += 4\nelif direction == 'west':\n    position[0] -= 4\n\n# Turn around\ndirection_index = (direction_index + 2) % 4\ndirection = directions[direction_index]\n\n# Take 4 steps\nif direction == 'north':\n    position[1] += 4\nelif direction == 'south':\n    position[1] -= 4\nelif direction == 'east':\n    position[0] += 4\nelif direction == 'west':\n    position[0] -= 4\n\n# Check if back to starting point\nresult = (position == [0, 0])\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that following the given instructions returns us to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
