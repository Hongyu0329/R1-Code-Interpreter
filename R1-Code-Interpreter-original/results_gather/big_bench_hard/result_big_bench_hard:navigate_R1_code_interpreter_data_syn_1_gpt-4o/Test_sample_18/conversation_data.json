    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the sequence of steps described will return us to the starting point. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Take 3 steps.\n2. Take 6 steps.\n3. Take 9 steps.\n\nThe problem can be interpreted as a simple arithmetic problem where we sum the steps taken and check if the total is zero, which would indicate returning to the starting point. However, since the problem does not specify directions, we assume all steps are in the same direction, and thus, we are looking for a net movement of zero.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of steps:\n\n- Total steps = 3 + 6 + 9\n\nIf the total is zero, we return to the starting point. Otherwise, we do not.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of steps\ntotal_steps = 3 + 6 + 9\n\n# Check if the total steps bring us back to the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if total_steps == 0 else \"No\"\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that the total number of steps is not zero, which means that we do not return to the starting point. The steps taken (3, 6, and 9) sum up to 18, which is not zero. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
