    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Movements**:\n   - \"Take 9 steps right\": This means moving 9 units in the positive x-direction. New position: (9, 0).\n   - \"Take 6 steps right\": Move 6 more units in the positive x-direction. New position: (15, 0).\n   - \"Take 10 steps backward\": Move 10 units in the negative y-direction. New position: (15, -10).\n   - \"Take 9 steps left\": Move 9 units in the negative x-direction. New position: (6, -10).\n   - \"Take 4 steps left\": Move 4 more units in the negative x-direction. New position: (2, -10).\n\n3. **Final Position**: After all movements, the final position is (2, -10).\n\n4. **Comparison with Starting Point**: The starting point is (0, 0), and the final position is (2, -10). Since these coordinates are different, the final position is not the same as the starting point.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to verify the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\nx += 9  # 9 steps right\nx += 6  # 6 steps right\ny -= 10 # 10 steps backward\nx -= 9  # 9 steps left\nx -= 4  # 4 steps left\n\n# Final position\nfinal_position = (x, y)\n\n# Check if final position is the same as the starting point\nstarting_point = (0, 0)\nresult = final_position == starting_point\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the final answer.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is not the same as the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
