    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the instructions given will result in returning to the starting point or not. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Always face forward.** - This means we are moving in a straight line in one direction.\n2. **Take 10 steps forward.** - We move 10 steps in the forward direction.\n3. **Take 4 steps backward.** - We move 4 steps in the opposite direction (backward).\n4. **Take 6 steps forward.** - We move 6 steps in the forward direction again.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initial position: 0\n- After 10 steps forward: 0 + 10 = 10\n- After 4 steps backward: 10 - 4 = 6\n- After 6 steps forward: 6 + 6 = 12\n\nThe final position is 12 steps away from the starting point. Therefore, we do not return to the starting point.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 10 steps forward\nposition += 10\n\n# Take 4 steps backward\nposition -= 4\n\n# Take 6 steps forward\nposition += 6\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<No>>>",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output \"No\" confirms that following the instructions does not return you to the starting point. The final position is 12 steps away from the starting point, so the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
