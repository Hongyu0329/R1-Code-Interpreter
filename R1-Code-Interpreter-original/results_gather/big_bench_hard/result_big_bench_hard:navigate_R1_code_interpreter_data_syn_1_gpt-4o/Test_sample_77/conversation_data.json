    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements step by step and determine the final position relative to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: (0, 0)\n2. **1 step backward**: This means moving in the negative y-direction. New position: (0, -1)\n3. **5 steps right**: This means moving in the positive x-direction. New position: (5, -1)\n4. **3 steps left**: This means moving in the negative x-direction. New position: (2, -1)\n5. **1 step backward**: This means moving in the negative y-direction. New position: (2, -2)\n6. **5 steps backward**: This means moving further in the negative y-direction. New position: (2, -7)\n7. **4 steps forward**: This means moving in the positive y-direction. New position: (2, -3)\n8. **3 steps forward**: This means moving further in the positive y-direction. New position: (2, 0)\n9. **2 steps left**: This means moving in the negative x-direction. New position: (0, 0)\n\nNow, let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\nmovements = [\n    (0, -1),  # 1 step backward\n    (5, 0),   # 5 steps right\n    (-3, 0),  # 3 steps left\n    (0, -1),  # 1 step backward\n    (0, -5),  # 5 steps backward\n    (0, 4),   # 4 steps forward\n    (0, 3),   # 3 steps forward\n    (-2, 0)   # 2 steps left\n]\n\n# Apply movements\nfor dx, dy in movements:\n    x += dx\n    y += dy\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that after following all the given instructions, you return to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
