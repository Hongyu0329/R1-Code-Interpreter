    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and turns to determine if we return to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0) facing north.\n2. Take 9 steps north.\n3. Turn left (now facing west).\n4. Turn left again (now facing south).\n5. Take 5 steps south.\n6. Take 4 steps south.\n7. Turn left (now facing east).\n8. Turn left again (now facing north).\n\nNow, let's calculate the final position:\n\n- Starting at (0, 0), after taking 9 steps north, the position is (0, 9).\n- After turning left twice, the direction is south, and taking 5 steps south brings the position to (0, 4).\n- Taking 4 more steps south brings the position to (0, 0).\n- After turning left twice, the direction is north, but no further steps are taken.\n\nThe final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Initial position and direction\nposition = [0, 0]\ndirection = 'N'\n\n# Define movements for each direction\nmovements = {\n    'N': (0, 1),\n    'E': (1, 0),\n    'S': (0, -1),\n    'W': (-1, 0)\n}\n\n# Define left turn mapping\nleft_turn = {\n    'N': 'W',\n    'W': 'S',\n    'S': 'E',\n    'E': 'N'\n}\n\n# Execute the steps\n# Take 9 steps\nfor _ in range(9):\n    move = movements[direction]\n    position[0] += move[0]\n    position[1] += move[1]\n\n# Turn left twice\ndirection = left_turn[direction]\ndirection = left_turn[direction]\n\n# Take 5 steps\nfor _ in range(5):\n    move = movements[direction]\n    position[0] += move[0]\n    position[1] += move[1]\n\n# Take 4 steps\nfor _ in range(4):\n    move = movements[direction]\n    position[0] += move[0]\n    position[1] += move[1]\n\n# Turn left twice\ndirection = left_turn[direction]\ndirection = left_turn[direction]\n\n# Check if we are back at the starting point\nresult = (position == [0, 0])\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
