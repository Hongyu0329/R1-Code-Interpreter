    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the instructions given and determine if they result in returning to the starting point. The instructions are:\n\n1. Always face forward.\n2. Take 2 steps forward.\n3. Take 2 steps backward.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- \"Always face forward\" implies that the direction does not change throughout the process.\n- \"Take 2 steps forward\" means moving 2 units in the forward direction.\n- \"Take 2 steps backward\" means moving 2 units in the opposite direction of forward.\n\nBy taking 2 steps forward and then 2 steps backward, you effectively return to the starting point because the backward steps negate the forward steps.\n\nNow, let's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to simulate the movement and check the final position relative to the starting point.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 2 steps forward\nposition += 2\n\n# Take 2 steps backward\nposition -= 2\n\n# Check if the final position is the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm whether the final position is the starting point.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is indeed the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
