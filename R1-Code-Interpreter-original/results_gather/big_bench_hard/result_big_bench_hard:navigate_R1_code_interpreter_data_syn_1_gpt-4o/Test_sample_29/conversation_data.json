    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the instructions given will return us to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. \"Always face forward.\" - This means we maintain a consistent direction throughout the steps.\n2. \"Take 5 steps forward.\" - We move 5 steps in the forward direction.\n3. \"Take 7 steps backward.\" - We move 7 steps in the backward direction.\n4. \"Take 10 steps backward.\" - We move 10 steps in the backward direction.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Forward steps: +5\n- Backward steps: -7 -10 = -17\n\nNet movement = Forward steps + Backward steps = 5 - 17 = -12\n\nSince the net movement is -12, we end up 12 steps behind the starting point. Therefore, we do not return to the starting point.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Calculate net movement\nforward_steps = 5\nbackward_steps = 7 + 10\nnet_movement = forward_steps - backward_steps\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nreturn_to_start = (net_movement == 0)\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if return_to_start else \"No\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm whether the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\".",
    "The code execution confirms that the answer is \"No\". The net movement calculation shows that we end up 12 steps behind the starting point, which means we do not return to the starting point.\n\n<<<No>>>"
