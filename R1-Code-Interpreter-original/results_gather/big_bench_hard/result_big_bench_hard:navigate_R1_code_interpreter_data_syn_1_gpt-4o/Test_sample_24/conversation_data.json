    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the instructions given will lead us back to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. \"Always face forward.\" - This implies that the initial direction is forward, and we maintain this direction throughout the instructions.\n2. \"Take 2 steps backward.\" - This means moving 2 steps in the opposite direction of forward.\n3. \"Take 8 steps backward.\" - This means moving 8 steps in the opposite direction of forward.\n\nLet's assume the starting point is at position 0 on a number line, where moving forward increases the position and moving backward decreases it.\n\n- Starting at position 0.\n- Taking 2 steps backward moves us to position -2.\n- Taking 8 steps backward moves us to position -10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final position to see if we return to the starting point (position 0).\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 2 steps backward\nposition -= 2\n\n# Take 8 steps backward\nposition -= 8\n\n# Output the final position\nprint(position)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will determine if the final position is 0, which would mean we return to the starting point. If not, the answer is \"No\".",
    "The code output indicates that the final position is -10, which means we do not return to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
