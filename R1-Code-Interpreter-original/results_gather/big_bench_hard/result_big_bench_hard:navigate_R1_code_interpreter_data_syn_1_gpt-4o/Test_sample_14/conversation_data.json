    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the final position relative to the starting point after following the given instructions. The instructions involve taking steps to the left and right, and we need to see if we end up at the starting point or not.\n\nLet's break down the instructions:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0 on a number line).\n2. Take 3 steps left: This means moving 3 units in the negative direction.\n3. Take 10 steps right: This means moving 10 units in the positive direction.\n4. Take 7 steps left: This means moving 7 units in the negative direction.\n\nWe can calculate the final position by summing these movements:\n\n- Start at position 0.\n- Move 3 steps left: Position = 0 - 3 = -3.\n- Move 10 steps right: Position = -3 + 10 = 7.\n- Move 7 steps left: Position = 7 - 7 = 0.\n\nThe final position is 0, which is the starting point. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes,\" we return to the starting point.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 3 steps left\nposition -= 3\n\n# Take 10 steps right\nposition += 10\n\n# Take 7 steps left\nposition -= 7\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is indeed the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
