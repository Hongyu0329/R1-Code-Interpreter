    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine the final position relative to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 8 steps forward**: This means moving 8 units in the forward direction. Let's assume forward is along the positive y-axis. So, the new position is (0, 8).\n\n3. **Take 5 steps backward**: Moving backward means moving in the opposite direction of forward, which is along the negative y-axis. So, the new position is (0, 8 - 5) = (0, 3).\n\n4. **Take 5 steps left**: Moving left means moving along the negative x-axis. So, the new position is (0 - 5, 3) = (-5, 3).\n\n5. **Take 5 steps forward**: Moving forward again means moving along the positive y-axis. So, the new position is (-5, 3 + 5) = (-5, 8).\n\nNow, we need to determine if this final position (-5, 8) is the same as the starting point (0, 0).\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to verify this:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\ny += 8  # 8 steps forward\ny -= 5  # 5 steps backward\nx -= 5  # 5 steps left\ny += 5  # 5 steps forward\n\n# Check if the final position is the same as the starting point\nfinal_position = (x, y)\nstarting_point = (0, 0)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Yes\" if final_position == starting_point else \"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine the final answer.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is not the same as the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
