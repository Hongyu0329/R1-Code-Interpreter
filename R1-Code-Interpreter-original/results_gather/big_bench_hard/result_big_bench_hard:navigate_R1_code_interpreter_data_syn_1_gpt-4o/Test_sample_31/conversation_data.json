    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement based on the given instructions and determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Movement Directions**:\n   - \"Forward\" can be considered as moving along the positive y-axis.\n   - \"Right\" can be considered as moving along the positive x-axis.\n   - \"Left\" can be considered as moving along the negative x-axis.\n\n3. **Steps Calculation**:\n   - Take 4 steps forward: This moves the position from (0, 0) to (0, 4).\n   - Take 5 steps right: This moves the position from (0, 4) to (5, 4).\n   - Take 7 steps left: This moves the position from (5, 4) to (-2, 4).\n\n4. **Final Position**: After executing all the steps, the final position is (-2, 4).\n\n5. **Check if Returned to Starting Point**: Compare the final position with the initial position (0, 0). If they are the same, the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the final position.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Take 4 steps forward\ny += 4\n\n# Take 5 steps right\nx += 5\n\n# Take 7 steps left\nx -= 7\n\n# Check if returned to starting point\nreturned_to_start = (x == 0 and y == 0)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Yes\" if returned_to_start else \"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to determine the final answer.",
    "Based on the code execution, the final position after following the instructions is not the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
