    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine if we return to the starting point. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. **Take 10 steps backward**: This means moving in the negative y-direction. New position: (0, -10).\n3. **Take 7 steps backward**: Continue moving in the negative y-direction. New position: (0, -17).\n4. **Take 8 steps right**: Move in the positive x-direction. New position: (8, -17).\n5. **Take 6 steps right**: Continue moving in the positive x-direction. New position: (14, -17).\n6. **Take 3 steps left**: Move in the negative x-direction. New position: (11, -17).\n\nNow, let's check if the final position is the same as the starting position (0, 0).\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\ny -= 10  # 10 steps backward\ny -= 7   # 7 steps backward\nx += 8   # 8 steps right\nx += 6   # 6 steps right\nx -= 3   # 3 steps left\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to determine if we return to the starting point.",
    "The code execution indicates that the final position is not the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
