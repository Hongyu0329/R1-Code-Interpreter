    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine if we return to the starting point. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **Take 7 steps**: Let's assume these steps are in the positive y-direction. New position: (0, 7).\n\n3. **Turn around**: This means we reverse direction. Now, we will move in the negative y-direction.\n\n4. **Take 10 steps**: Move 10 steps in the negative y-direction. New position: (0, -3).\n\n5. **Take 2 steps**: Continue in the negative y-direction. New position: (0, -5).\n\n6. **Turn around**: Reverse direction again. Now, we will move in the positive y-direction.\n\n7. **Take 5 steps**: Move 5 steps in the positive y-direction. New position: (0, 0).\n\n8. **Turn left**: This changes our direction to the positive x-direction, but since we don't move any further, the position remains the same.\n\nNow, let's verify this reasoning with a simple Python script to track the position:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Take 7 steps forward (positive y-direction)\ny += 7\n\n# Turn around and take 10 steps (negative y-direction)\ny -= 10\n\n# Take 2 steps (still negative y-direction)\ny -= 2\n\n# Turn around and take 5 steps (positive y-direction)\ny += 5\n\n# Final position\nprint((x, y))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the final position.",
    "The code output indicates that the final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point. Therefore, after following all the steps and turns, you do return to the starting point.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
