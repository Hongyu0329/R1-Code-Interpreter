    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the net movement in each direction. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Take 5 steps**: This is ambiguous without a direction, but let's assume it's in a positive direction (e.g., north).\n2. **Take 5 steps**: Continue in the same direction, so now a total of 10 steps in the positive direction.\n3. **Take 2 steps**: Continue in the same direction, so now a total of 12 steps in the positive direction.\n4. **Turn around**: This reverses the direction.\n5. **Take 8 steps**: Now moving in the negative direction, so net movement is 12 - 8 = 4 steps in the positive direction.\n6. **Take 4 steps**: Continue in the negative direction, so net movement is 4 - 4 = 0 steps.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to simulate this movement and check if we return to the starting point.\n\n```python\n# Initialize position\nposition = 0\n\n# Simulate the steps\nposition += 5  # Take 5 steps\nposition += 5  # Take 5 steps\nposition += 2  # Take 2 steps\nposition -= 8  # Turn around and take 8 steps\nposition -= 4  # Take 4 steps\n\n# Check if returned to the starting point\nprint(position == 0)\n```\n\nThe code will output `True` if the final position is the starting point, otherwise `False`. Let's execute the code to verify.\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes<<<answer>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and returned `True`, indicating that you do return to the starting point after following the given steps. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<answer>>>Yes<<<answer>>>"
