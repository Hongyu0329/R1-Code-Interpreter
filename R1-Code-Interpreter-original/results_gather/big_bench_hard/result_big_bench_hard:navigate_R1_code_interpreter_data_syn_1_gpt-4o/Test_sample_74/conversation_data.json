    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements step by step and determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. We will use a coordinate system where:\n\n- \"forward\" increases the y-coordinate.\n- \"backward\" decreases the y-coordinate.\n- \"left\" decreases the x-coordinate.\n- \"right\" increases the x-coordinate.\n\nLet's start at the origin (0, 0) and apply each movement:\n\n1. Start at (0, 0).\n2. Take 9 steps left: (0 - 9, 0) = (-9, 0).\n3. Take 7 steps forward: (-9, 0 + 7) = (-9, 7).\n4. Take 9 steps right: (-9 + 9, 7) = (0, 7).\n5. Take 7 steps left: (0 - 7, 7) = (-7, 7).\n6. Take 7 steps backward: (-7, 7 - 7) = (-7, 0).\n7. Take 8 steps right: (-7 + 8, 0) = (1, 0).\n8. Take 10 steps left: (1 - 10, 0) = (-9, 0).\n9. Take 1 step backward: (-9, 0 - 1) = (-9, -1).\n10. Take 1 step forward: (-9, -1 + 1) = (-9, 0).\n\nThe final position is (-9, 0), which is not the same as the starting point (0, 0).\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\nmovements = [\n    (-9, 0),  # 9 steps left\n    (0, 7),   # 7 steps forward\n    (9, 0),   # 9 steps right\n    (-7, 0),  # 7 steps left\n    (0, -7),  # 7 steps backward\n    (8, 0),   # 8 steps right\n    (-10, 0), # 10 steps left\n    (0, -1),  # 1 step backward\n    (0, 1)    # 1 step forward\n]\n\n# Apply movements\nfor dx, dy in movements:\n    x += dx\n    y += dy\n\n# Check if back to starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether the final position is the same as the starting point. Let's execute it.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is not the same as the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
