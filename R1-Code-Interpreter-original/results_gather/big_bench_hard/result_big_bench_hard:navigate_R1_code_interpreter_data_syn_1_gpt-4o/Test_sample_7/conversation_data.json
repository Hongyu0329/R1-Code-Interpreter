    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps forward and backward. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 6 steps forward: position = 0 + 6 = 6.\n3. Take 7 steps backward: position = 6 - 7 = -1.\n4. Take 7 steps backward again: position = -1 - 7 = -8.\n5. Take 8 steps forward: position = -8 + 8 = 0.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Steps taken\nposition += 6  # 6 steps forward\nposition -= 7  # 7 steps backward\nposition -= 7  # 7 steps backward\nposition += 8  # 8 steps forward\n\n# Output the final position\nprint(position)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the final position.",
    "The code output confirms that the final position is 0, which means you return to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
