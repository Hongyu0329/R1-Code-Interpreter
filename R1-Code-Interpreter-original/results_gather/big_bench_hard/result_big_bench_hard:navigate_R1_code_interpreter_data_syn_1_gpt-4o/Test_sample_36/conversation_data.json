    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement in both the forward-backward and left-right directions. We can consider the forward direction as positive and backward as negative for the forward-backward axis. Similarly, we can consider the left direction as positive and right as negative for the left-right axis.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Take 9 steps forward: (0, 9)\n3. Take 7 steps left: (7, 9)\n4. Take 5 steps backward: (7, 4)\n5. Take 4 steps right: (3, 4)\n6. Take 3 steps right: (0, 4)\n7. Take 4 steps backward: (0, 0)\n\nAfter performing all these movements, we end up at the origin (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\nmovements = [\n    (0, 9),   # 9 steps forward\n    (7, 0),   # 7 steps left\n    (0, -5),  # 5 steps backward\n    (-4, 0),  # 4 steps right\n    (-3, 0),  # 3 steps right\n    (0, -4)   # 4 steps backward\n]\n\n# Apply movements\nfor dx, dy in movements:\n    x += dx\n    y += dy\n\n# Check if we are back at the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if (x, y) == (0, 0) else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that after performing all the movements, we return to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
