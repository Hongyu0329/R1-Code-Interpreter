    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the directions and how they affect the position. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate plane, facing forward (let's assume forward is along the positive y-axis).\n\n2. **Take 2 steps right**: \n   - Facing forward (positive y-axis), taking 2 steps right means moving along the positive x-axis. \n   - New position: (2, 0).\n\n3. **Take 2 steps right**: \n   - Still facing forward, taking 2 more steps right means moving along the positive x-axis again.\n   - New position: (4, 0).\n\n4. **Take 4 steps left**: \n   - Facing forward, taking steps left means moving along the negative x-axis.\n   - New position: (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Take 2 steps right\nx += 2\n\n# Take 2 steps right\nx += 2\n\n# Take 4 steps left\nx -= 4\n\n# Check if we are back to the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that after following the given instructions, you return to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
