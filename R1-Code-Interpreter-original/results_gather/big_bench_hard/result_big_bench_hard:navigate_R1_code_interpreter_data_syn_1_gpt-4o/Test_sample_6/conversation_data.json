    "To solve this problem, we need to track the position of a person starting from a certain point and following the given instructions. The instructions involve moving in four possible directions: forward, backward, left, and right. We will assume a coordinate system where:\n\n- \"forward\" increases the y-coordinate.\n- \"backward\" decreases the y-coordinate.\n- \"right\" increases the x-coordinate.\n- \"left\" decreases the x-coordinate.\n\nThe starting point is (0, 0). We will follow the instructions step by step and calculate the final position. Finally, we will check if the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute the final position:\n\n```python\n# Starting position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Instructions\ninstructions = [\n    (\"right\", 6),\n    (\"forward\", 1),\n    (\"left\", 10),\n    (\"forward\", 8),\n    (\"backward\", 9),\n    (\"right\", 4)\n]\n\n# Process each instruction\nfor direction, steps in instructions:\n    if direction == \"right\":\n        x += steps\n    elif direction == \"left\":\n        x -= steps\n    elif direction == \"forward\":\n        y += steps\n    elif direction == \"backward\":\n        y -= steps\n\n# Check if the final position is the starting point\nis_starting_point = (x == 0 and y == 0)\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if is_starting_point else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if the final position is the same as the starting point.",
    "The code execution indicates that the final position is indeed the starting point. Therefore, after following all the instructions, the person returns to the starting point.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
