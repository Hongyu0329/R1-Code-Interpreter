    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps and determine if the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 6 steps forward: position = 0 + 6 = 6.\n3. Take 2 steps backward: position = 6 - 2 = 4.\n4. Take 4 steps backward: position = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to verify this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 6 steps forward\nposition += 6\n\n# Take 2 steps backward\nposition -= 2\n\n# Take 4 steps backward\nposition -= 4\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm whether the final position is the same as the starting point.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned \"Yes,\" which means that after following the given instructions, you do return to the starting point. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
