    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the net movement based on the given instructions and see if it results in returning to the starting point.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume the starting point is at position 0 on a number line.\n\n2. **Instructions**:\n   - \"Take 1 step right\": This means moving 1 unit to the right, so the position becomes 0 + 1 = 1.\n   - \"Take 4 steps right\": This means moving 4 units to the right, so the position becomes 1 + 4 = 5.\n   - \"Take 5 steps left\": This means moving 5 units to the left, so the position becomes 5 - 5 = 0.\n\n3. **Final Position**: After executing all the instructions, the final position is 0, which is the same as the starting point.\n\nSince the final position is the same as the starting point, the answer to the question is \"Yes\".\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Execute the instructions\nposition += 1  # 1 step right\nposition += 4  # 4 steps right\nposition -= 5  # 5 steps left\n\n# Check if the final position is the same as the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned \"Yes\", which confirms that the final position is the same as the starting point after following the given instructions.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
