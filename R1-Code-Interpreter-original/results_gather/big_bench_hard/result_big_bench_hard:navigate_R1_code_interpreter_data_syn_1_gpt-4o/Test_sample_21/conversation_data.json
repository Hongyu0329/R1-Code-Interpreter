    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Take 4 steps**: This means moving 4 steps in a certain direction. Let's assume the initial direction is forward.\n2. **Take 2 steps**: Continue moving in the same direction, adding 2 more steps.\n3. **Turn around**: This means reversing the direction.\n4. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 steps in the new direction (which is opposite to the initial direction).\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initial movement: 4 steps forward + 2 steps forward = 6 steps forward.\n- After turning around, moving 6 steps backward.\n\nThe net movement is 6 steps forward - 6 steps backward = 0 steps.\n\nSince the net movement is zero, the final position is the same as the starting point.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 4 steps forward\nposition += 4\n\n# Take 2 more steps forward\nposition += 2\n\n# Turn around and take 6 steps backward\nposition -= 6\n\n# Check if the final position is the starting point\nprint(\"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm whether the final position is the same as the starting point.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is indeed the same as the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
