    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the final position after following the given instructions. We start at an initial position and follow the steps to see if we return to the starting point.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Let's assume the initial position is 0 on a number line.\n2. **Steps**:\n   - Take 8 steps left: This means moving 8 units in the negative direction. New position = 0 - 8 = -8.\n   - Take 6 steps right: This means moving 6 units in the positive direction. New position = -8 + 6 = -2.\n   - Take 10 steps right: Move 10 units in the positive direction. New position = -2 + 10 = 8.\n   - Take 2 steps left: Move 2 units in the negative direction. New position = 8 - 2 = 6.\n   - Take 5 steps left: Move 5 units in the negative direction. New position = 6 - 5 = 1.\n   - Take 1 step left: Move 1 unit in the negative direction. New position = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nAfter following all the steps, we end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Steps\nposition -= 8  # 8 steps left\nposition += 6  # 6 steps right\nposition += 10 # 10 steps right\nposition -= 2  # 2 steps left\nposition -= 5  # 5 steps left\nposition -= 1  # 1 step left\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nprint(position == 0)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the result.",
    "The code output is `True`, which confirms that after following all the steps, we return to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
