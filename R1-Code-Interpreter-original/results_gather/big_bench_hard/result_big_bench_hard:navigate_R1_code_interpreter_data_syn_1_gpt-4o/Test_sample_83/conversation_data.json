    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the movements and determine if they lead back to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) facing a certain direction, say North.\n\n2. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 units in the current direction (North).\n\n3. **Turn around**: Change direction to the opposite of the current one (South).\n\n4. **Turn right**: From South, turning right means facing West.\n\n5. **Turn left**: From West, turning left means facing South again.\n\n6. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 units in the current direction (South).\n\n7. **Turn around**: Change direction to the opposite of the current one (North).\n\n8. **Turn around**: Change direction to the opposite of the current one (South).\n\nNow, let's calculate the final position after these movements to see if it returns to the starting point.\n\n```python\n# Initial position and direction\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = 'N'\n\n# Function to move in the current direction\ndef move(steps, direction, x, y):\n    if direction == 'N':\n        y += steps\n    elif direction == 'S':\n        y -= steps\n    elif direction == 'E':\n        x += steps\n    elif direction == 'W':\n        x -= steps\n    return x, y\n\n# Function to turn around\ndef turn_around(direction):\n    if direction == 'N':\n        return 'S'\n    elif direction == 'S':\n        return 'N'\n    elif direction == 'E':\n        return 'W'\n    elif direction == 'W':\n        return 'E'\n\n# Function to turn right\ndef turn_right(direction):\n    if direction == 'N':\n        return 'E'\n    elif direction == 'E':\n        return 'S'\n    elif direction == 'S':\n        return 'W'\n    elif direction == 'W':\n        return 'N'\n\n# Function to turn left\ndef turn_left(direction):\n    if direction == 'N':\n        return 'W'\n    elif direction == 'W':\n        return 'S'\n    elif direction == 'S':\n        return 'E'\n    elif direction == 'E':\n        return 'N'\n\n# Execute the steps\nx, y = move(2, direction, x, y)  # Take 2 steps\ndirection = turn_around(direction)  # Turn around\ndirection = turn_right(direction)  # Turn right\ndirection = turn_left(direction)  # Turn left\nx, y = move(2, direction, x, y)  # Take 2 steps\ndirection = turn_around(direction)  # Turn around\ndirection = turn_around(direction)  # Turn around\n\n# Check if back to starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if the final position is the starting point.",
    "The code output indicates that the final position is indeed the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
