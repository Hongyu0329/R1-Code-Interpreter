    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps and determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 9 steps backward: This means moving from position 0 to position -9.\n3. Take 2 steps forward: This moves the position from -9 to -7.\n4. Take 1 step backward: This moves the position from -7 to -8.\n5. Take 8 steps forward: This moves the position from -8 to 0.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initial position: 0\n- After 9 steps backward: 0 - 9 = -9\n- After 2 steps forward: -9 + 2 = -7\n- After 1 step backward: -7 - 1 = -8\n- After 8 steps forward: -8 + 8 = 0\n\nThe final position is 0, which is the same as the starting point. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes.\"\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Steps\nposition -= 9  # 9 steps backward\nposition += 2  # 2 steps forward\nposition -= 1  # 1 step backward\nposition += 8  # 8 steps forward\n\n# Check if the final position is the same as the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final answer. \n\n<<<Yes>>>",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output confirms that the final position is the same as the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
