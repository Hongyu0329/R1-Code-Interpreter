    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement in both the forward/backward and left/right directions. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0).\n\n2. **8 steps forward**: This moves us to (0, 8).\n\n3. **9 steps right**: This moves us to (9, 8).\n\n4. **2 steps forward**: This moves us to (9, 10).\n\n5. **10 steps backward**: This moves us to (9, 0).\n\n6. **9 steps left**: This moves us to (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Move 8 steps forward\ny += 8\n\n# Move 9 steps right\nx += 9\n\n# Move 2 steps forward\ny += 2\n\n# Move 10 steps backward\ny -= 10\n\n# Move 9 steps left\nx -= 9\n\n# Check if we are back at the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that after following all the instructions, you return to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
