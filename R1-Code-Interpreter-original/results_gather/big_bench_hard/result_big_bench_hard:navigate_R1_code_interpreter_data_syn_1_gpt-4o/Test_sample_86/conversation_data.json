    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine the final position relative to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Always face forward.** - This implies that the initial direction is forward, which we can assume as north for simplicity.\n\n2. **Take 10 steps left.** - If facing north, turning left means facing west. So, 10 steps left means moving 10 steps west.\n\n3. **Take 4 steps forward.** - Since we are facing west, 4 steps forward means moving 4 steps west.\n\n4. **Take 1 step left.** - From facing west, turning left means facing south. So, 1 step left means moving 1 step south.\n\n5. **Take 4 steps backward.** - Since we are facing south, 4 steps backward means moving 4 steps north.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement in each direction:\n\n- **West:** 10 steps (from step 2) + 4 steps (from step 3) = 14 steps west.\n- **South:** 1 step (from step 4).\n- **North:** 4 steps (from step 5).\n\nThe net movement in the north-south direction is 4 steps north - 1 step south = 3 steps north.\n\nThe net movement in the east-west direction is 14 steps west.\n\nNow, let's determine if we return to the starting point:\n\n- We moved 14 steps west and 3 steps north. Since both are non-zero, we did not return to the starting point.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to calculate the final position:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\nx -= 10  # 10 steps left (west)\nx -= 4   # 4 steps forward (west)\ny -= 1   # 1 step left (south)\ny += 4   # 4 steps backward (north)\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nreturn_to_start = (x == 0 and y == 0)\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if return_to_start else \"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "Based on the code execution, the output is \"No,\" which means we do not return to the starting point. The reasoning and calculations confirm that the final position is not the starting point due to the net movements in the west and north directions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
