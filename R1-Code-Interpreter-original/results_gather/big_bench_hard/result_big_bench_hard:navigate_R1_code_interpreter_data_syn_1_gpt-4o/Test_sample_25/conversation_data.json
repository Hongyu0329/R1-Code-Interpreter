    "To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements and turns. Let's assume the starting point is at coordinates (0, 0) and the initial direction is facing north (upwards on a coordinate plane).\n\n1. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 units north. New position: (0, 9).\n2. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 units north. New position: (0, 15).\n3. **Take 9 steps**: Move 9 units north. New position: (0, 24).\n4. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 units north. New position: (0, 30).\n5. **Take 2 steps**: Move 2 units north. New position: (0, 32).\n6. **Turn left**: Now facing west.\n7. **Take 6 steps**: Move 6 units west. New position: (-6, 32).\n8. **Turn around**: Now facing east.\n9. **Take 8 steps**: Move 8 units east. New position: (2, 32).\n\nThe final position is (2, 32), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to simulate the movements and turns.\n\n```python\n# Initial position and direction\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = 'N'  # N = North, E = East, S = South, W = West\n\n# Define movements based on direction\nmovements = {\n    'N': (0, 1),\n    'E': (1, 0),\n    'S': (0, -1),\n    'W': (-1, 0)\n}\n\n# Define turns\nleft_turn = {'N': 'W', 'W': 'S', 'S': 'E', 'E': 'N'}\nright_turn = {'N': 'E', 'E': 'S', 'S': 'W', 'W': 'N'}\n\n# Execute the steps\nsteps = [\n    (9, None),  # Take 9 steps\n    (6, None),  # Take 6 steps\n    (9, None),  # Take 9 steps\n    (6, None),  # Take 6 steps\n    (2, None),  # Take 2 steps\n    (None, 'L'),  # Turn left\n    (6, None),  # Take 6 steps\n    (None, 'A'),  # Turn around\n    (8, None)   # Take 8 steps\n]\n\nfor step, turn in steps:\n    if step is not None:\n        dx, dy = movements[direction]\n        x += dx * step\n        y += dy * step\n    if turn == 'L':\n        direction = left_turn[direction]\n    elif turn == 'A':\n        direction = right_turn[right_turn[direction]]\n\n# Check if returned to starting point\nreturned_to_start = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Returned to starting point:\", returned_to_start)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
