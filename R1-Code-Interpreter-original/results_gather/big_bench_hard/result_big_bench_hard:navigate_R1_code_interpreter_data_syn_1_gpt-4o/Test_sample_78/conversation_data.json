    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement based on the given instructions and determine if we return to the starting point.\n\nLet's break down the instructions:\n\n1. \"Always face forward.\" - This implies that the initial direction is forward, and we will consider this as the positive y-direction.\n2. \"Take 5 steps right.\" - Since we are facing forward, taking steps to the right means moving in the positive x-direction.\n3. \"Take 8 steps backward.\" - Moving backward means moving in the negative y-direction.\n4. \"Take 1 step right.\" - Again, moving in the positive x-direction.\n5. \"Take 7 steps backward.\" - Moving further in the negative y-direction.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement in the x and y directions:\n\n- Initial position: (0, 0)\n- After 5 steps right: (5, 0)\n- After 8 steps backward: (5, -8)\n- After 1 step right: (6, -8)\n- After 7 steps backward: (6, -15)\n\nThe final position is (6, -15). Since this is not the starting point (0, 0), the answer is \"No.\"\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Take 5 steps right\nx += 5\n\n# Take 8 steps backward\ny -= 8\n\n# Take 1 step right\nx += 1\n\n# Take 7 steps backward\ny -= 7\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the final answer.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is not the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
