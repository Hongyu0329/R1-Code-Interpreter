    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the final position of a person who follows the given instructions. The instructions are:\n\n1. Always face forward.\n2. Take 9 steps left.\n3. Take 4 steps backward.\n\nLet's break down the instructions:\n\n- \"Always face forward\" implies that the initial direction is forward, which we can assume to be the positive x-direction.\n- \"Take 9 steps left\" means moving 9 steps in the negative y-direction (since left is perpendicular to forward).\n- \"Take 4 steps backward\" means moving 4 steps in the negative x-direction (opposite to the initial forward direction).\n\nNow, let's calculate the final position:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Move 9 steps left: (0, 0) -> (0, -9).\n3. Move 4 steps backward: (0, -9) -> (-4, -9).\n\nThe final position is (-4, -9). The question asks if you return to the starting point, which is (0, 0). Since (-4, -9) is not equal to (0, 0), the answer is \"No\".\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Move 9 steps left (negative y-direction)\ny -= 9\n\n# Move 4 steps backward (negative x-direction)\nx -= 4\n\n# Check if the final position is the starting point\nis_starting_point = (x == 0 and y == 0)\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if is_starting_point else \"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is not the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
