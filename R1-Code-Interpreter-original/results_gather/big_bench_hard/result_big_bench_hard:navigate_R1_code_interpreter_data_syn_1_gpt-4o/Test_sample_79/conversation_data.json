    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps based on the instructions given. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 10 steps forward: position = 0 + 10 = 10.\n3. Take 4 steps forward: position = 10 + 4 = 14.\n4. Take 7 steps backward: position = 14 - 7 = 7.\n5. Take 7 steps backward: position = 7 - 7 = 0.\n\nAfter following all the instructions, we end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Steps according to the instructions\nposition += 10  # 10 steps forward\nposition += 4   # 4 steps forward\nposition -= 7   # 7 steps backward\nposition -= 7   # 7 steps backward\n\n# Output the final position\nprint(position)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm whether the final position is indeed 0, indicating that we have returned to the starting point.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output confirms that the final position is 0, which means we have returned to the starting point after following all the instructions.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
