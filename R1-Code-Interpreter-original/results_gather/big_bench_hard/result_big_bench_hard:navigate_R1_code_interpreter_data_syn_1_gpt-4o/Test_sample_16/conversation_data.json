    "To solve this problem, we need to track the net movement of steps based on the given instructions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (let's call it position 0).\n2. Take 9 steps forward: This moves the position to 9.\n3. Take 1 step backward: This moves the position to 8.\n4. Take 4 steps backward: This moves the position to 4.\n5. Take 4 steps backward: This moves the position to 0.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final position using a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Steps according to the instructions\nposition += 9  # 9 steps forward\nposition -= 1  # 1 step backward\nposition -= 4  # 4 steps backward\nposition -= 4  # 4 steps backward\n\n# Output the final position\nprint(position)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the final position.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is 0. This means that after following all the instructions, you return to the starting point.\n\n<<<No>>>"
