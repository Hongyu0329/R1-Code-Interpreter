    "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the steps and turns described in the instructions. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin at a certain point, which we can consider as the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate plane.\n\n2. **Take 10 steps**: We assume the initial direction is forward, which we can consider as moving along the positive x-axis. So, after taking 10 steps, the position will be (10, 0).\n\n3. **Turn left**: A left turn from the positive x-axis will change the direction to the positive y-axis.\n\n4. **Turn left again**: Another left turn from the positive y-axis will change the direction to the negative x-axis.\n\n5. **Take 10 steps**: Moving 10 steps in the negative x-axis direction will bring the position back to the origin (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to simulate the movement and check if we return to the starting point.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Take 10 steps forward (initially along the positive x-axis)\nx += 10\n\n# Turn left (now facing positive y-axis)\n# Turn left again (now facing negative x-axis)\n\n# Take 10 steps in the negative x-axis direction\nx -= 10\n\n# Check if we are back at the starting point\nresult = (x, y) == (0, 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm whether we return to the starting point.",
    "Based on the code execution, the output is \"Yes,\" which confirms that following the instructions does indeed return us to the starting point. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
