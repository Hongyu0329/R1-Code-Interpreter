    "To solve this problem, we need to track the position of a person starting from a certain point, following the given instructions. The instructions are:\n\n1. \"Always face forward.\" - This implies that the person is initially facing forward and will continue to face forward throughout the process.\n2. \"Take 8 steps backward.\" - This means moving 8 steps in the opposite direction of forward.\n3. \"Take 2 steps backward.\" - This means moving 2 more steps in the opposite direction of forward.\n4. \"Take 10 steps forward.\" - This means moving 10 steps in the forward direction.\n\nLet's assume the starting point is at position 0. We will calculate the final position after following these instructions.\n\n- Start at position 0.\n- Move 8 steps backward: Position = 0 - 8 = -8\n- Move 2 steps backward: Position = -8 - 2 = -10\n- Move 10 steps forward: Position = -10 + 10 = 0\n\nThe final position is 0, which is the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes.\"\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nposition = 0\n\n# Take 8 steps backward\nposition -= 8\n\n# Take 2 steps backward\nposition -= 2\n\n# Take 10 steps forward\nposition += 10\n\n# Check if the final position is the starting point\nresult = \"Yes\" if position == 0 else \"No\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the final position is indeed the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
