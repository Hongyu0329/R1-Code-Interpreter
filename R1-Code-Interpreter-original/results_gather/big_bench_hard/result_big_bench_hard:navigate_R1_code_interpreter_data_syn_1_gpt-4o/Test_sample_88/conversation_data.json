    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and turns to determine if we return to the starting point. Let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0) facing north.\n2. Turn left: Now facing west.\n3. Turn right: Now facing north.\n4. Take 8 steps: Move 8 steps north to (0, 8).\n5. Take 4 steps: Move 4 steps north to (0, 12).\n6. Turn right: Now facing east.\n7. Turn right: Now facing south.\n8. Take 10 steps: Move 10 steps south to (0, 2).\n9. Take 1 step: Move 1 step south to (0, 1).\n10. Take 1 step: Move 1 step south to (0, 0).\n\nAfter following these instructions, we end up at the starting point (0, 0).\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to simulate the movements:\n\n```python\n# Initial position and direction\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = 'N'  # N = North, E = East, S = South, W = West\n\n# Function to turn left\ndef turn_left(current_direction):\n    directions = ['N', 'W', 'S', 'E']\n    return directions[(directions.index(current_direction) + 1) % 4]\n\n# Function to turn right\ndef turn_right(current_direction):\n    directions = ['N', 'E', 'S', 'W']\n    return directions[(directions.index(current_direction) + 1) % 4]\n\n# Function to move forward\ndef move_forward(x, y, direction, steps):\n    if direction == 'N':\n        y += steps\n    elif direction == 'E':\n        x += steps\n    elif direction == 'S':\n        y -= steps\n    elif direction == 'W':\n        x -= steps\n    return x, y\n\n# Follow the instructions\ndirection = turn_left(direction)\ndirection = turn_right(direction)\nx, y = move_forward(x, y, direction, 8)\nx, y = move_forward(x, y, direction, 4)\ndirection = turn_right(direction)\ndirection = turn_right(direction)\nx, y = move_forward(x, y, direction, 10)\nx, y = move_forward(x, y, direction, 1)\nx, y = move_forward(x, y, direction, 1)\n\n# Check if we are back at the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that following the given instructions returns us to the starting point. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
