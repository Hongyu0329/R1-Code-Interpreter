    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movements and determine if we return to the starting point. We will consider a coordinate system where:\n\n- \"forward\" increases the y-coordinate.\n- \"backward\" decreases the y-coordinate.\n- \"right\" increases the x-coordinate.\n- \"left\" decreases the x-coordinate.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Take 8 steps backward: (0, -8).\n3. Take 9 steps forward: (0, 1).\n4. Take 4 steps forward: (0, 5).\n5. Take 2 steps left: (-2, 5).\n6. Take 4 steps forward: (-2, 9).\n7. Take 6 steps forward: (-2, 15).\n8. Take 10 steps backward: (-2, 5).\n9. Take 8 steps right: (6, 5).\n10. Take 1 step left: (5, 5).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to verify these calculations and determine if we return to the starting point.\n\n```python\n# Initial position\nx, y = 0, 0\n\n# Movements\nmovements = [\n    (0, -8),  # 8 steps backward\n    (0, 9),   # 9 steps forward\n    (0, 4),   # 4 steps forward\n    (-2, 0),  # 2 steps left\n    (0, 4),   # 4 steps forward\n    (0, 6),   # 6 steps forward\n    (0, -10), # 10 steps backward\n    (8, 0),   # 8 steps right\n    (-1, 0)   # 1 step left\n]\n\n# Apply movements\nfor dx, dy in movements:\n    x += dx\n    y += dy\n\n# Check if we return to the starting point\nresult = (x == 0 and y == 0)\nprint(\"Yes\" if result else \"No\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine if we return to the starting point.",
    "The code execution indicates that the final position is not the starting point, which means the answer is \"No.\" The movements do not bring us back to the origin (0, 0).\n\n<<<No>>>"
