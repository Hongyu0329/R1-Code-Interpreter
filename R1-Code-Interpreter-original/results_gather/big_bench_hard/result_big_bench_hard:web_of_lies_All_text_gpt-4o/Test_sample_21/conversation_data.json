    "To determine whether Alejandro tells the truth, we need to analyze the chain of statements and the implications of each person telling the truth or lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Ryan tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Ryan always tells the truth.\n\n2. **Sal says Ryan tells the truth.**\n   - Since Ryan tells the truth, Sal's statement is true. Therefore, Sal tells the truth.\n\n3. **Leda says Sal tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sal tells the truth, Leda's statement is true. Therefore, Leda tells the truth.\n\n4. **Rashida says Leda tells the truth.**\n   - Since Leda tells the truth, Rashida's statement is true. Therefore, Rashida tells the truth.\n\n5. **Alejandro says Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - Since Rashida tells the truth, Alejandro's statement is true. Therefore, Alejandro tells the truth.\n\nEach statement in the chain is dependent on the previous one being true. Since we started with the assumption that Ryan tells the truth, and each subsequent person in the chain also tells the truth, we conclude that Alejandro tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Alejandro tells the truth>>>."
