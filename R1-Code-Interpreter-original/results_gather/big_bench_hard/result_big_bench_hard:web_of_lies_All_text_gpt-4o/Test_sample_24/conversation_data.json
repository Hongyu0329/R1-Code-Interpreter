    "To determine whether Lorine tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Delfina tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Delfina tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Fletcher says Delfina lies.**\n   - If Fletcher is telling the truth, then Delfina must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Delfina tells the truth. Therefore, Fletcher must be lying.\n\n3. **Amberly says Fletcher lies.**\n   - Since we have determined that Fletcher is lying, Amberly's statement is true. Therefore, Amberly tells the truth.\n\n4. **Audrie says Amberly tells the truth.**\n   - Since Amberly tells the truth, Audrie's statement is also true. Therefore, Audrie tells the truth.\n\n5. **Lorine says Audrie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Audrie tells the truth, Lorine's statement is true. Therefore, Lorine tells the truth.\n\nBased on the logical analysis of each statement, we conclude that Lorine tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<yes>>>."
