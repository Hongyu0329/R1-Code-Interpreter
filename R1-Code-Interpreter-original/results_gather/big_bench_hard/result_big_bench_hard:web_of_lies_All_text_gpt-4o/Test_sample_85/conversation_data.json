    "To determine whether Sal tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Bernita tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Bernita tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Audrie says Bernita lies.**\n   - If Audrie is telling the truth, then Bernita must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Bernita tells the truth. Therefore, Audrie must be lying.\n\n3. **Delfina says Audrie tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Audrie is lying, Delfina's statement that Audrie tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Delfina is lying.\n\n4. **Vina says Delfina lies.**\n   - We have determined that Delfina is indeed lying. Therefore, Vina's statement that Delfina lies is true. Thus, Vina is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Sal says Vina tells the truth.**\n   - Since Vina is telling the truth, Sal's statement that Vina tells the truth is also true. Therefore, Sal is telling the truth.\n\nBy analyzing each statement and its implications, we conclude that Sal tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<yes>>>."
