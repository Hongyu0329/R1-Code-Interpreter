    "To determine whether Lorine tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Christie tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume it to be true.\n\n2. **Ka says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Christie tells the truth, Ka's statement is also true.\n\n3. **Delbert says Ka lies.**\n   - Since Ka's statement is true (as Christie tells the truth), Delbert's statement must be false. Therefore, Delbert lies.\n\n4. **Leda says Delbert tells the truth.**\n   - Since Delbert lies, Leda's statement is false. Therefore, Leda lies.\n\n5. **Lorine says Leda tells the truth.**\n   - Since Leda lies, Lorine's statement is false. Therefore, Lorine lies.\n\nBased on the analysis, Lorine does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
