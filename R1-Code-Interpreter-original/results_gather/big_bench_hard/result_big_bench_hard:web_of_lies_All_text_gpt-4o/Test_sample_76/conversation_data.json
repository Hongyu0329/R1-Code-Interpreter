    "To determine whether Shenna tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Conception tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Conception tells the truth, then any statement made by Conception is true.\n\n2. **Teressa says Conception lies.**\n   - If Teressa is telling the truth, then Conception must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Conception tells the truth. Therefore, Teressa must be lying.\n\n3. **Sal says Teressa tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Teressa is lying, Sal's statement that Teressa tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Sal is also lying.\n\n4. **Fidel says Sal tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sal is lying, Fidel's statement that Sal tells the truth is false. Therefore, Fidel is also lying.\n\n5. **Shenna says Fidel lies.**\n   - We have established that Fidel is lying. Therefore, Shenna's statement that Fidel lies is true.\n\nSince Shenna's statement is consistent with our analysis, Shenna is telling the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<true>>>."
