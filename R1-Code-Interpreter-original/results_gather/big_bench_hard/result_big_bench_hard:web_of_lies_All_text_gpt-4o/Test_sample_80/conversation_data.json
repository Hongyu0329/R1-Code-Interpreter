    "To determine whether Teressa tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Christie tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Christie tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Jamey says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - If Jamey is telling the truth, then Christie's statement is true. Since we know Christie tells the truth, Jamey must be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Michael says Jamey lies.**\n   - If Michael is telling the truth, then Jamey is lying. However, we have already established that Jamey tells the truth. Therefore, Michael must be lying.\n\n4. **Rashida says Michael tells the truth.**\n   - If Rashida is telling the truth, then Michael's statement is true. But we have determined that Michael is lying. Therefore, Rashida must be lying.\n\n5. **Teressa says Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - If Teressa is telling the truth, then Rashida's statement is true. However, we have established that Rashida is lying. Therefore, Teressa must be lying.\n\nBased on the logical analysis of each statement, we conclude that Teressa does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
