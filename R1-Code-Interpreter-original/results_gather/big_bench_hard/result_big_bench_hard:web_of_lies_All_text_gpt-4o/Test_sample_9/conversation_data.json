    "To determine whether Fidel tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Rashida tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Jim says Rashida lies.**\n   - If Jim is telling the truth, then Rashida must be lying. However, we know Rashida tells the truth, so Jim must be lying.\n\n3. **Alejandro says Jim lies.**\n   - Since we have established that Jim is lying, Alejandro's statement is true. Therefore, Alejandro tells the truth.\n\n4. **Tamika says Alejandro tells the truth.**\n   - Since Alejandro does indeed tell the truth, Tamika's statement is true. Therefore, Tamika tells the truth.\n\n5. **Fidel says Tamika lies.**\n   - Since Tamika tells the truth, Fidel's statement that Tamika lies is false. Therefore, Fidel is lying.\n\nBased on the analysis, Fidel does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
