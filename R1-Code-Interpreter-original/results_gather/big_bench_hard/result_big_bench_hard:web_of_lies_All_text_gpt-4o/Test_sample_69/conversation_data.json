    "To determine whether Vina tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Phoebe tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Phoebe tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Jamey says Phoebe lies.**\n   - If Jamey is telling the truth, then Phoebe must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Phoebe tells the truth. Therefore, Jamey must be lying.\n\n3. **Audrie says Jamey tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Jamey is lying, Audrie's statement that Jamey tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Audrie is lying.\n\n4. **Michaela says Audrie lies.**\n   - We have determined that Audrie is indeed lying. Therefore, Michaela's statement that Audrie lies is true. Michaela is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Vina says Michaela lies.**\n   - Since Michaela is telling the truth, Vina's statement that Michaela lies must be false. Therefore, Vina is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Vina does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
