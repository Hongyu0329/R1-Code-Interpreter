Therefore, Andree lies.\n\n3. **Audrie says Andree lies.**\n   - We have established that Andree lies. Therefore, Audrie's statement is true.\n\n4. **Antwan says Audrie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Audrie's statement is true, Antwan's statement that Audrie tells the truth is also true.\n\n5. **Millie says Antwan tells the truth.**\n   - Since Antwan's statement is true, Millie's statement that Antwan tells the truth is also true.\n\nTherefore, Millie tells the truth.\n\n<<<true>>>"
