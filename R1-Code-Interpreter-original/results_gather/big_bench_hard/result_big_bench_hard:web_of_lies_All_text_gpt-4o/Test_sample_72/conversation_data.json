    "To determine whether Vernell tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Millicent lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume it to be true for the analysis.\n\n2. **Shenna says Millicent lies.**\n   - If Shenna tells the truth, then Millicent indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. Therefore, Shenna is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Willian says Shenna tells the truth.**\n   - Since Shenna is telling the truth (as established in step 2), Willian's statement is also true. Therefore, Willian tells the truth.\n\n4. **Kandi says Willian lies.**\n   - Since Willian tells the truth (as established in step 3), Kandi's statement is false. Therefore, Kandi lies.\n\n5. **Vernell says Kandi lies.**\n   - Since Kandi lies (as established in step 4), Vernell's statement is true. Therefore, Vernell tells the truth.\n\nBased on the above analysis, Vernell tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<true>>>."
