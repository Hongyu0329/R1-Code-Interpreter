    "To determine whether Crista tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Willian's Statement**: \"Willian lies.\"\n   - If Willian is lying, then his statement \"Willian lies\" is false, which means Willian tells the truth.\n   - If Willian is telling the truth, then his statement \"Willian lies\" is true, which means Willian lies.\n   - This creates a paradox, so we need to consider the implications of other statements to resolve it.\n\n2. **Inga's Statement**: \"Inga says Willian tells the truth.\"\n   - If Inga is telling the truth, then Willian tells the truth.\n   - If Inga is lying, then Willian does not tell the truth, meaning Willian lies.\n\n3. **Fidel's Statement**: \"Fidel says Inga lies.\"\n   - If Fidel is telling the truth, then Inga lies.\n   - If Fidel is lying, then Inga tells the truth.\n\n4. **Gwenn's Statement**: \"Gwenn says Fidel tells the truth.\"\n   - If Gwenn is telling the truth, then Fidel tells the truth.\n   - If Gwenn is lying, then Fidel does not tell the truth, meaning Fidel lies.\n\n5. **Crista's Statement**: \"Crista says Gwenn tells the truth.\"\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Gwenn tells the truth.\n   - If Crista is lying, then Gwenn does not tell the truth, meaning Gwenn lies.\n\nNow, let's analyze the chain of statements:\n\n- If Crista tells the truth, then Gwenn tells the truth.\n- If Gwenn tells the truth, then Fidel tells the truth.\n- If Fidel tells the truth, then Inga lies.\n- If Inga lies, then Willian does not tell the truth, meaning Willian lies.\n\nThis chain of reasoning is consistent and does not lead to any contradictions. Therefore, Crista telling the truth is a valid scenario.\n\nLet's verify the opposite scenario:\n\n- If Crista lies, then Gwenn does not tell the truth, meaning Gwenn lies.\n- If Gwenn lies, then Fidel does not tell the truth, meaning Fidel lies.\n- If Fidel lies, then Inga tells the truth.\n- If Inga tells the truth, then Willian tells the truth.\n\nThis scenario is also consistent, but it contradicts the initial paradox with Willian's statement. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is the one where Crista tells the truth.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Crista tells the truth>>>"
