    "To determine if Shaunda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Antwan tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Antwan tells the truth, then any statement he makes is true.\n\n2. **Helene says Antwan tells the truth.**\n   - Helene's statement is consistent with the given information that Antwan tells the truth. If Helene tells the truth, then her statement is true, which aligns with the fact that Antwan tells the truth.\n\n3. **Gwenn says Helene tells the truth.**\n   - If Gwenn tells the truth, then Helene must also be telling the truth. Since Helene's statement that Antwan tells the truth is consistent with the given information, Gwenn's statement can be true if Helene is truthful.\n\n4. **Sal says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n   - If Sal tells the truth, then Gwenn must also be telling the truth. This would mean that Helene tells the truth, which means Antwan tells the truth. This is consistent with the given information.\n\n5. **Shaunda says Sal lies.**\n   - If Shaunda tells the truth, then Sal must be lying. If Sal is lying, then Gwenn does not tell the truth, which means Helene does not tell the truth, which means Antwan does not tell the truth. However, this contradicts the given information that Antwan tells the truth.\n\nSince assuming Shaunda tells the truth leads to a contradiction with the given information that Antwan tells the truth, Shaunda cannot be telling the truth. Therefore, Shaunda must be lying.\n\n<<<Shaunda does not tell the truth>>>"
