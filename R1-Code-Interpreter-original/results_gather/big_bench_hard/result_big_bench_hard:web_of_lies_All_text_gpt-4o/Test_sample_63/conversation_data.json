    "To determine if Dallas tells the truth, we need to analyze the chain of statements and the implications of each person telling the truth or lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jerry tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Jerry is truthful.\n\n2. **Elanor says Jerry tells the truth.**\n   - Since Jerry tells the truth, Elanor's statement is true. Therefore, Elanor is also telling the truth.\n\n3. **Gwenn says Elanor tells the truth.**\n   - Since Elanor tells the truth, Gwenn's statement is true. Therefore, Gwenn is also telling the truth.\n\n4. **Kandi says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n   - Since Gwenn tells the truth, Kandi's statement is true. Therefore, Kandi is also telling the truth.\n\n5. **Dallas says Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - Since Kandi tells the truth, Dallas's statement is true. Therefore, Dallas is also telling the truth.\n\nEach person's statement is dependent on the previous person's truthfulness, and since we started with the assumption that Jerry tells the truth, each subsequent person in the chain also tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that Dallas tells the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>> Dallas tells the truth."
