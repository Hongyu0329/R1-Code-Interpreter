    "To determine whether Shalonda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jerry lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. Jerry always lies.\n\n2. **Helene says Jerry lies.**\n   - If Helene is telling the truth, then Jerry indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. Therefore, Helene is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Kandi says Helene tells the truth.**\n   - Since Helene is telling the truth (as established in step 2), Kandi is also telling the truth.\n\n4. **Jaymie says Kandi lies.**\n   - Since Kandi is telling the truth (as established in step 3), Jaymie's statement that Kandi lies is false. Therefore, Jaymie is lying.\n\n5. **Shalonda says Jaymie lies.**\n   - Since Jaymie is lying (as established in step 4), Shalonda's statement that Jaymie lies is true.\n\nBased on the above analysis, Shalonda is telling the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<true>>>."
