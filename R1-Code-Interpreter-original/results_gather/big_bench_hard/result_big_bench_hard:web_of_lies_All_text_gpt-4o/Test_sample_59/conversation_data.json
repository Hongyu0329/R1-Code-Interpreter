    "To determine whether Crista tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements step by step and consider the implications of each statement being true or false.\n\n1. **Ka tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Ka tells the truth, then any statement Ka makes is true.\n\n2. **Fletcher says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - If Fletcher tells the truth, then Ka indeed tells the truth. If Fletcher lies, then Ka does not tell the truth.\n\n3. **Maybelle says Fletcher lies.**\n   - If Maybelle tells the truth, then Fletcher lies. If Maybelle lies, then Fletcher tells the truth.\n\n4. **Lorine says Maybelle lies.**\n   - If Lorine tells the truth, then Maybelle lies. If Lorine lies, then Maybelle tells the truth.\n\n5. **Crista says Lorine tells the truth.**\n   - If Crista tells the truth, then Lorine tells the truth. If Crista lies, then Lorine does not tell the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If Ka tells the truth, then Fletcher's statement that \"Ka tells the truth\" is true, meaning Fletcher tells the truth.\n- If Fletcher tells the truth, then Maybelle's statement that \"Fletcher lies\" is false, meaning Maybelle lies.\n- If Maybelle lies, then Lorine's statement that \"Maybelle lies\" is true, meaning Lorine tells the truth.\n- If Lorine tells the truth, then Crista's statement that \"Lorine tells the truth\" is true, meaning Crista tells the truth.\n\nThus, if we assume Ka tells the truth, it leads to a consistent chain of truth-telling, ending with Crista telling the truth.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Ka does not tell the truth:\n\n- If Ka does not tell the truth, then Fletcher's statement that \"Ka tells the truth\" is false, meaning Fletcher lies.\n- If Fletcher lies, then Maybelle's statement that \"Fletcher lies\" is true, meaning Maybelle tells the truth.\n- If Maybelle tells the truth, then Lorine's statement that \"Maybelle lies\" is false, meaning Lorine lies.\n- If Lorine lies, then Crista's statement that \"Lorine tells the truth\" is false, meaning Crista lies.\n\nThis scenario leads to Crista lying, which is consistent with the assumption that Ka does not tell the truth.\n\nTherefore, the truthfulness of Crista depends on whether Ka tells the truth. Since the problem states \"Ka tells the truth,\" we conclude that Crista tells the truth.\n\n<<<Crista tells the truth>>>"
