    "To determine whether Rashida tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Sima tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Jim says Sima lies.**\n   - If Jim is telling the truth, then Sima must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Sima tells the truth. Therefore, Jim must be lying.\n\n3. **Gwenn says Jim tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Jim is lying, Gwenn's statement that Jim tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Gwenn is lying.\n\n4. **Phoebe says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n   - Since Gwenn is lying, Phoebe's statement that Gwenn tells the truth must also be false. Therefore, Phoebe is lying.\n\n5. **Rashida says Phoebe lies.**\n   - We have established that Phoebe is indeed lying. Therefore, Rashida's statement that Phoebe lies is true.\n\nSince Rashida's statement is true, Rashida tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Rashida tells the truth>>>."
