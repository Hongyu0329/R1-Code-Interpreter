    "To determine if Conception tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Kandi always tells the truth.\n\n2. **Alejandro says Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - Since Kandi tells the truth, Alejandro's statement is true. Therefore, Alejandro is telling the truth in this instance.\n\n3. **Millicent says Alejandro lies.**\n   - We have established that Alejandro tells the truth (at least in the context of his statement about Kandi). Therefore, Millicent's statement that Alejandro lies is false. This means Millicent is lying.\n\n4. **Shalonda says Millicent lies.**\n   - Since Millicent is indeed lying (as established in the previous step), Shalonda's statement is true. Therefore, Shalonda is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Conception says Shalonda lies.**\n   - Since Shalonda is telling the truth, Conception's statement that Shalonda lies is false. Therefore, Conception is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Conception does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
