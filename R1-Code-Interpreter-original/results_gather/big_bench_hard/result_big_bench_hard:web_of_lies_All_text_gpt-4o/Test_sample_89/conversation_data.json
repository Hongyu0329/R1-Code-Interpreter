    "To determine whether Fletcher tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Ryan lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Ryan always lies.\n\n2. **Kandi says Ryan lies.**\n   - If Kandi is telling the truth, then Ryan indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. Therefore, Kandi could be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Lorine says Kandi lies.**\n   - If Lorine is telling the truth, then Kandi is lying. However, if Kandi is lying, then Ryan does not lie, which contradicts the given statement that Ryan lies. Therefore, Lorine must be lying.\n\n4. **Christie says Lorine tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have determined that Lorine is lying, Christie's statement that Lorine tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Christie is lying.\n\n5. **Fletcher says Christie lies.**\n   - Since we have determined that Christie is indeed lying, Fletcher's statement that Christie lies is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, Fletcher is telling the truth.\n\n<<<answer>>> Fletcher tells the truth."
