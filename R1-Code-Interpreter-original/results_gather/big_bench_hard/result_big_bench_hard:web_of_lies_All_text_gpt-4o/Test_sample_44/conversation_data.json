    "To determine whether Gwenn tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Millicent lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume it to be true for the analysis.\n\n2. **Alexis says Millicent lies.**\n   - If Alexis is telling the truth, then Millicent indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. Therefore, Alexis is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Inga says Alexis tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have determined that Alexis is telling the truth, Inga's statement is also true. Therefore, Inga tells the truth.\n\n4. **Christie says Inga lies.**\n   - Since Inga tells the truth, Christie's statement that Inga lies is false. Therefore, Christie is lying.\n\n5. **Gwenn says Christie lies.**\n   - Since Christie is lying, Gwenn's statement that Christie lies is true.
