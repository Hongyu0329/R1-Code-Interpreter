    "To determine whether Helene tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Maybelle tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Maybelle tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Bernita says Maybelle tells the truth.**\n   - If Bernita is telling the truth, then Maybelle indeed tells the truth. This is consistent with the given statement about Maybelle.\n\n3. **Inga says Bernita tells the truth.**\n   - If Inga is telling the truth, then Bernita tells the truth, which means Maybelle tells the truth.\n\n4. **Tamika says Inga lies.**\n   - If Tamika is telling the truth, then Inga is lying. If Inga is lying, then Bernita does not tell the truth, which means Maybelle does not tell the truth. This contradicts the given statement that Maybelle tells the truth.\n\n5. **Helene says Tamika tells the truth.**\n   - If Helene is telling the truth, then Tamika tells the truth, which means Inga lies, Bernita does not tell the truth, and Maybelle does not tell the truth. This contradicts the given statement that Maybelle tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If Maybelle tells the truth, then Bernita's statement is true, Inga's statement is true, and Tamika's statement is false. Therefore, Helene's statement that Tamika tells the truth must also be false.\n\n- If Helene tells the truth, then Tamika tells the truth, which leads to a contradiction because it implies Maybelle does not tell the truth.\n\nTherefore, Helene cannot be telling the truth because it leads to a contradiction with the given statement that Maybelle tells the truth.\n\n<<<no>>>"
