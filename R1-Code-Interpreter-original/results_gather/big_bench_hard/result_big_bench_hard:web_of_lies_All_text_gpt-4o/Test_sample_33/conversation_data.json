    "To determine whether Michael tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements step by step, considering the implications of each person's statement and the possibility of them lying or telling the truth.\n\n1. **Jerry lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Jerry lies, then any statement he makes is false.\n\n2. **Helene says Jerry lies.**\n   - If Helene tells the truth, then Jerry indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. If Helene lies, then Jerry does not lie, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, Helene must be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Alexis says Helene tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Helene tells the truth, Alexis's statement is true. Therefore, Alexis tells the truth.\n\n4. **Sherrie says Alexis tells the truth.**\n   - Since Alexis tells the truth, Sherrie's statement is also true. Therefore, Sherrie tells the truth.\n\n5. **Michael says Sherrie tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sherrie tells the truth, Michael's statement is true. Therefore, Michael tells the truth.\n\nBased on the logical analysis of each statement, we conclude that Michael tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<yes>>>."
