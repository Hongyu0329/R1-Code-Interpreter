    "To determine if Crista tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements step by step and identify any contradictions.\n\n1. **Leda tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Leda tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Shalonda says Leda lies.**\n   - If Shalonda is telling the truth, then Leda lies. However, this contradicts the given statement that Leda tells the truth. Therefore, Shalonda must be lying.\n\n3. **Shenna says Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Shalonda is lying, Shenna's statement that Shalonda tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Shenna is lying.\n\n4. **Christie says Shenna lies.**\n   - We have determined that Shenna is indeed lying. Therefore, Christie's statement that Shenna lies is true. Thus, Christie is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Crista says Christie tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Christie is telling the truth, Crista's statement that Christie tells the truth is also true.\n\nTherefore, Crista tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<true>>>."
