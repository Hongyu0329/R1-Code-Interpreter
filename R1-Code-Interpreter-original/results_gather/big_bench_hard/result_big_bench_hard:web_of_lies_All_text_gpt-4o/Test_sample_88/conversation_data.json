    "To determine whether Christie tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Helene tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Helene tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Lorine says Helene lies.**\n   - If Lorine is telling the truth, then Helene must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Helene tells the truth. Therefore, Lorine must be lying.\n\n3. **Raymond says Lorine tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Lorine is lying, Raymond's statement that Lorine tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Raymond is lying.\n\n4. **Ka says Raymond tells the truth.**\n   - Since Raymond is lying, Ka's statement that Raymond tells the truth must also be false. Therefore, Ka is lying.\n\n5. **Christie says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - Since Ka is lying, Christie's statement that Ka tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Christie is lying.\n\nBased on the logical deductions from the statements, Christie does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
