    "To determine whether Shalonda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements step by step, considering the implications of each person's statement.\n\n1. **Inga tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Inga tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Shenna says Inga lies.**\n   - If Shenna is telling the truth, then Inga must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Inga tells the truth. Therefore, Shenna must be lying.\n\n3. **Rashida says Shenna tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Shenna is lying, Rashida's statement that Shenna tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Rashida is lying.\n\n4. **Ka says Rashida tells the truth.**\n   - Since Rashida is lying, Ka's statement that Rashida tells the truth must also be false. Therefore, Ka is lying.\n\n5. **Shalonda says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - Since Ka is lying, Shalonda's statement that Ka tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Shalonda is lying.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Shalonda does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
