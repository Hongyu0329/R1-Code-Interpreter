    "To determine whether Maybelle tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Audrie tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Audrie tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Yoland says Audrie lies.**\n   - If Yoland is telling the truth, then Audrie must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Audrie tells the truth. Therefore, Yoland must be lying.\n\n3. **Shaunda says Yoland tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Yoland is lying, Shaunda's statement that Yoland tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Shaunda is lying.\n\n4. **Raymond says Shaunda lies.**\n   - We have determined that Shaunda is indeed lying. Therefore, Raymond's statement that Shaunda lies is true. Thus, Raymond is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Maybelle says Raymond lies.**\n   - Since Raymond is telling the truth, Maybelle's statement that Raymond lies must be false. Therefore, Maybelle is lying.\n\nBased on the analysis, Maybelle does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
