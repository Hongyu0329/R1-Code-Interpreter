    "To determine whether Gwenn tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Leda tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Leda tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Alexis says Leda lies.**\n   - If Alexis is telling the truth, then Leda must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Leda tells the truth. Therefore, Alexis must be lying.\n\n3. **Sal says Alexis lies.**\n   - Since we have determined that Alexis is lying, Sal's statement is true. Therefore, Sal tells the truth.\n\n4. **Phoebe says Sal tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sal tells the truth, Phoebe's statement is also true. Therefore, Phoebe tells the truth.\n\n5. **Gwenn says Phoebe tells the truth.**\n   - Since Phoebe tells the truth, Gwenn's statement is true. Therefore, Gwenn tells the truth.\n\nBy analyzing each statement and its implications, we conclude that Gwenn tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Gwenn tells the truth>>>."
