    "To determine whether Vina tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Sima tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Michaela says Sima lies.**\n   - If Michaela says Sima lies, and Sima actually tells the truth, then Michaela must be lying. Therefore, Michaela's statement is false.\n\n3. **Leda says Michaela tells the truth.**\n   - Since Michaela's statement is false (as established in step 2), Leda's statement that Michaela tells the truth must also be false. Therefore, Leda is lying.\n\n4. **Fletcher says Leda lies.**\n   - Since Leda is indeed lying (as established in step 3), Fletcher's statement that Leda lies is true. Therefore, Fletcher is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Vina says Fletcher tells the truth.**\n   - Since Fletcher is telling the truth (as established in step 4), Vina's statement that Fletcher tells the truth is also true.\n\nTherefore, Vina tells the truth.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<yes>>>."
