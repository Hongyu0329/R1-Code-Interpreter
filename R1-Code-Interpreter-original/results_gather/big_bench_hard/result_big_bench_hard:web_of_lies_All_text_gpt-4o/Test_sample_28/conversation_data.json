  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether Jamey tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements step by step, considering the implications of each person's statement.\n\n1. **Ryan lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Ryan lies, then any statement he makes is false.\n\n2. **Kristian says Ryan lies.**\n   - If Kristian tells the truth, then Ryan indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. If Kristian lies, then Ryan does not lie, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, Kristian must be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Teressa says Kristian tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have determined that Kristian tells the truth, Teressa's statement is true. Therefore, Teressa tells the truth.\n\n4. **Amberly says Teressa tells the truth.**\n   - Since Teressa tells the truth, Amberly's statement is true. Therefore, Amberly tells the truth.\n\n5. **Jamey says Amberly tells the truth.**\n   - Since Amberly tells the truth, Jamey's statement is true. Therefore, Jamey tells the truth.\n\nBased on the logical analysis of each statement, we conclude that Jamey tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<yes>>>."
