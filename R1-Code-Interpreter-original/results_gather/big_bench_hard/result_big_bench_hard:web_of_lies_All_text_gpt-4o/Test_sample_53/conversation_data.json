    "To determine whether Millicent tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Bernita tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Bernita tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Michael says Bernita tells the truth.**\n   - Michael's statement is consistent with Bernita telling the truth. If Michael tells the truth, then Bernita indeed tells the truth. If Michael lies, then Bernita does not tell the truth.\n\n3. **Fidel says Michael lies.**\n   - If Fidel tells the truth, then Michael lies. If Fidel lies, then Michael tells the truth.\n\n4. **Dallas says Fidel tells the truth.**\n   - If Dallas tells the truth, then Fidel tells the truth, which means Michael lies. If Dallas lies, then Fidel does not tell the truth, which means Michael tells the truth.\n\n5. **Millicent says Dallas lies.**\n   - If Millicent tells the truth, then Dallas lies, which means Fidel does not tell the truth, and Michael tells the truth. If Millicent lies, then Dallas tells the truth, which means Fidel tells the truth, and Michael lies.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- If Millicent tells the truth:\n  - Dallas lies.\n  - Therefore, Fidel does not tell the truth.\n  - Therefore, Michael tells the truth.\n  - Therefore, Bernita tells the truth (consistent with Michael's statement).\n\n- If Millicent lies:\n  - Dallas tells the truth.\n  - Therefore, Fidel tells the truth.\n  - Therefore, Michael lies.\n  - Therefore, Bernita does not tell the truth (inconsistent with the given that Bernita tells the truth).\n\nSince the scenario where Millicent lies leads to a contradiction (Bernita not telling the truth), Millicent must be telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Millicent tells the truth>>>."
