    "To determine whether Alexis tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements step by step, considering the implications of each person's statement.\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Sima tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Yoland says Sima lies.**\n   - If Yoland is telling the truth, then Sima must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Sima tells the truth. Therefore, Yoland must be lying.\n\n3. **Amberly says Yoland tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Yoland is lying, Amberly's statement that Yoland tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Amberly is lying.\n\n4. **Inga says Amberly lies.**\n   - We have determined that Amberly is indeed lying. Therefore, Inga's statement that Amberly lies is true. Thus, Inga is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Alexis says Inga tells the truth.**\n   - Since Inga is telling the truth, Alexis's statement that Inga tells the truth is also true.\n\nTherefore, Alexis tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<true>>>."
