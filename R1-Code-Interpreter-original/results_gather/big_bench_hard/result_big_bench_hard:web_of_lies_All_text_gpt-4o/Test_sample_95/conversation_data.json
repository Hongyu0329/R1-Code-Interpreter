    "To determine whether Michaela tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Phoebe tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Phoebe tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Helene says Phoebe lies.**\n   - If Helene says Phoebe lies, and Phoebe actually tells the truth, then Helene must be lying.\n\n3. **Sima says Helene lies.**\n   - Since we have determined that Helene is lying, Sima's statement that Helene lies is true. Therefore, Sima tells the truth.\n\n4. **Alejandro says Sima tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sima tells the truth, Alejandro's statement that Sima tells the truth is also true. Therefore, Alejandro tells the truth.\n\n5. **Michaela says Alejandro lies.**\n   - Since Alejandro tells the truth, Michaela's statement that Alejandro lies is false. Therefore, Michaela is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Michaela does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
