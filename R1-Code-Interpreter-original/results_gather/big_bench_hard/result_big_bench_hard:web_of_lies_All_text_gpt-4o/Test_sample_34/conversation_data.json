    "To determine whether Jim tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Fidel's Statement**: Fidel tells the truth.\n   - If Fidel tells the truth, then his statement is true.\n\n2. **Tamika's Statement**: Tamika says Fidel lies.\n   - If Tamika tells the truth, then Fidel lies, which contradicts the assumption that Fidel tells the truth. Therefore, Tamika must be lying.\n\n3. **Shenna's Statement**: Shenna says Tamika lies.\n   - Since we have established that Tamika is lying, Shenna's statement is true. Therefore, Shenna tells the truth.\n\n4. **Audrie's Statement**: Audrie says Shenna lies.\n   - Since Shenna tells the truth, Audrie's statement is false. Therefore, Audrie is lying.\n\n5. **Jim's Statement**: Jim says Audrie tells the truth.\n   - Since Audrie is lying, Jim's statement is false. Therefore, Jim is lying.\n\nBy analyzing each statement and its implications, we conclude that Jim does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
