    "To determine whether Leda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Teressa lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Teressa always lies.\n\n2. **Kristian says Teressa lies.**\n   - If Kristian tells the truth, then Teressa indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement about Teressa. Therefore, Kristian is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Sal says Kristian tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have determined that Kristian tells the truth, Sal's statement is also true. Therefore, Sal tells the truth.\n\n4. **Audrie says Sal lies.**\n   - Since Sal tells the truth, Audrie's statement that Sal lies is false. Therefore, Audrie is lying.\n\n5. **Leda says Audrie lies.**\n   - Since Audrie is lying, Leda's statement that Audrie lies is true. Therefore, Leda tells the truth.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we conclude that Leda tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<yes>>>."
