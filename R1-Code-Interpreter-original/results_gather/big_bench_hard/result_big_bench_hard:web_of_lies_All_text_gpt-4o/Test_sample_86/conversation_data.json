    "To determine whether Teressa tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jamey lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume Jamey always lies.\n\n2. **Raymond says Jamey lies.**\n   - If Raymond is telling the truth, then Jamey indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement about Jamey.\n   - If Raymond is lying, then Jamey does not lie, which contradicts the given statement about Jamey.\n   - Therefore, Raymond must be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Ka says Raymond lies.**\n   - Since we established that Raymond tells the truth, Ka's statement that Raymond lies must be false.\n   - Therefore, Ka is lying.\n\n4. **Bernita says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - Since we established that Ka is lying, Bernita's statement that Ka tells the truth must be false.\n   - Therefore, Bernita is lying.\n\n5. **Teressa says Bernita lies.**\n   - We established that Bernita is indeed lying.\n   - Therefore, Teressa's statement that Bernita lies is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, Teressa is telling the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<yes>>>."
