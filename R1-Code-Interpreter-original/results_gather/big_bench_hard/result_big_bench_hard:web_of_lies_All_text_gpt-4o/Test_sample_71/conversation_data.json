    "To determine whether Delfina tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Kandi tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Crista says Kandi lies.**\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Kandi must be lying. However, this contradicts the given statement that Kandi tells the truth. Therefore, Crista must be lying.\n\n3. **Ryan says Crista tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Crista is lying, Ryan's statement that Crista tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Ryan is lying.\n\n4. **Gwenn says Ryan tells the truth.**\n   - Since Ryan is lying, Gwenn's statement that Ryan tells the truth is false. Therefore, Gwenn is lying.\n\n5. **Delfina says Gwenn tells the truth.**\n   - Since Gwenn is lying, Delfina's statement that Gwenn tells the truth is false. Therefore, Delfina is lying.\n\nBased on the logical analysis of each person's statements, we conclude that Delfina does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
