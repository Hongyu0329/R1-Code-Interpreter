    "To determine whether Millicent tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements step by step, starting from the innermost statement and working our way outwards.\n\n1. **Jim lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. We assume it to be true for the purpose of this analysis.\n\n2. **Crista says Jim lies.**\n   - If Crista is telling the truth, then Jim indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. Therefore, Crista is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Vernell says Crista tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Crista tells the truth, Vernell is also telling the truth.\n\n4. **Bernita says Vernell tells the truth.**\n   - Since Vernell tells the truth, Bernita is also telling the truth.\n\n5. **Millicent says Bernita tells the truth.**\n   - Since Bernita tells the truth, Millicent is also telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical progression of truth-telling from Jim to Millicent, we conclude that Millicent tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<yes>>>."
