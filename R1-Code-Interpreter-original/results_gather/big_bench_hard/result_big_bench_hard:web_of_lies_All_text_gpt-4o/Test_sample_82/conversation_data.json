    "To determine whether Conception tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Elanor lies.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Elanor lies, then any statement she makes is false.\n\n2. **Tamika says Elanor lies.**\n   - If Tamika tells the truth, then Elanor indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement. If Tamika lies, then Elanor does not lie, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, Tamika must be telling the truth.\n\n3. **Ka says Tamika tells the truth.**\n   - Since we have established that Tamika tells the truth, Ka's statement is true. Therefore, Ka tells the truth.\n\n4. **Shaunda says Ka lies.**\n   - Since Ka tells the truth, Shaunda's statement that Ka lies is false. Therefore, Shaunda lies.\n\n5. **Conception says Shaunda lies.**\n   - Since Shaunda lies, Conception's statement that Shaunda lies is true. Therefore, Conception tells the truth.\n\nBy analyzing each statement and its implications, we conclude that Conception tells the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<true>>>."
