    "To determine whether Sal tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Kandi tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Kandi tells the truth, then any statement she makes is true.\n\n2. **Michaela says Kandi lies.**\n   - If Michaela is telling the truth, then Kandi must be lying. However, we know from the first statement that Kandi tells the truth. Therefore, Michaela must be lying.\n\n3. **Vernell says Michaela lies.**\n   - Since we have established that Michaela is lying, Vernell's statement is true. Therefore, Vernell tells the truth.\n\n4. **Antwan says Vernell tells the truth.**\n   - Since Vernell tells the truth, Antwan's statement is also true. Therefore, Antwan tells the truth.\n\n5. **Sal says Antwan lies.**\n   - Since Antwan tells the truth, Sal's statement that Antwan lies is false. Therefore, Sal is lying.\n\nBased on the analysis, Sal does not tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<no>>>."
