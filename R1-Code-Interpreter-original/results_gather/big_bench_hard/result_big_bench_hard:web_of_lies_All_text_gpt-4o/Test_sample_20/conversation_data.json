    "To determine if Elanor tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Raymond tells the truth.**\n   - This is a given statement. If Raymond tells the truth, then any statement he makes is true.\n\n2. **Sal says Raymond lies.**\n   - If Sal says Raymond lies, and we know Raymond tells the truth, then Sal must be lying. Therefore, Sal is a liar.\n\n3. **Alexis says Sal lies.**\n   - Since Sal is indeed lying (as established in step 2), Alexis is telling the truth when she says Sal lies. Therefore, Alexis is a truth-teller.\n\n4. **Helene says Alexis lies.**\n   - Since Alexis is telling the truth (as established in step 3), Helene's statement that Alexis lies is false. Therefore, Helene is lying.\n\n5. **Elanor says Helene lies.**\n   - Since Helene is lying (as established in step 4), Elanor's statement that Helene lies is true. Therefore, Elanor is telling the truth.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Elanor does tell the truth.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Elanor tells the truth>>>."
