At the start of the game, they are each holding a ball: Alice has a yellow ball, Bob has a blue ball, and Claire has a pink ball.\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players trade balls. First, Claire and Alice swap balls. Then, Alice and Bob swap balls. Finally, Claire and Bob swap balls.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of ball swaps between Alice, Bob, and Claire. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Yellow\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Pink\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives her Yellow ball to Claire and takes Claire's Pink ball.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: Pink\n     - Bob: Blue\n     - Claire: Yellow\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice gives her Pink ball to Bob and takes Bob's Blue ball.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: Blue\n     - Bob: Pink\n     - Claire: Yellow\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives her Yellow ball to Bob and takes Bob's Pink ball.\n   - Final State:\n     - Alice: Blue\n     - Bob: Yellow\n     - Claire: Pink\n\nAfter these swaps, Alice ends up with the Blue ball. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B) blue ball>>>"
