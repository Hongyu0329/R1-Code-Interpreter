    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Book Ownership:**\n   - Alice: Catch-22\n   - Bob: Moby Dick\n   - Claire: The Great Gatsby\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives \"The Great Gatsby\" to Bob.\n   - Bob gives \"Moby Dick\" to Claire.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice: Catch-22\n     - Bob: The Great Gatsby\n     - Claire: Moby Dick\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire gives \"Moby Dick\" to Alice.\n   - Alice gives \"Catch-22\" to Claire.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice: Moby Dick\n     - Bob: The Great Gatsby\n     - Claire: Catch-22\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives \"The Great Gatsby\" to Claire.\n   - Claire gives \"Catch-22\" to Bob.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice: Moby Dick\n     - Bob: Catch-22\n     - Claire: The Great Gatsby\n\nAt the end of the semester, Alice has \"Moby Dick.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B) Moby Dick>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are friends and avid readers who occasionally trade books.
