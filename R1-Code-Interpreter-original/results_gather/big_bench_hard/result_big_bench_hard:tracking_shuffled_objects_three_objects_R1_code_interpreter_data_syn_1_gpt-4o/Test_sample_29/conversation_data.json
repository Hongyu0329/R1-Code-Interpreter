  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Karl, Bob is dancing with Rodrigo, and Claire is dancing with Patrick.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Claire and Alice switch partners. Then, Bob and Alice switch partners. Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners. At the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Karl\n(B) Rodrigo\n(C) Patrick\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Partners:**\n   - Alice is with Karl.\n   - Bob is with Rodrigo.\n   - Claire is with Patrick.\n\n2. **First Switch (Claire and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Patrick.\n   - Claire is now with Karl.\n   - Bob is still with Rodrigo.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Bob and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is now with Patrick.\n   - Claire is still with Karl.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Alice and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Karl.\n   - Claire is now with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is still with Patrick.\n\nAfter these switches, we need to determine who Claire is dancing with. Let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial partners\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Karl',\n    'Bob': 'Rodrigo',\n    'Claire': 'Patrick'\n}\n\n# First switch: Claire and Alice switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Second switch: Bob and Alice switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Bob'] = partners['Bob'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Third switch: Alice and Claire switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Output the final partner of Claire\nprint(partners['Claire'])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out who Claire is dancing with at the end.",
    "Based on the code execution, Claire is dancing with Rodrigo at the end of the dance. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
