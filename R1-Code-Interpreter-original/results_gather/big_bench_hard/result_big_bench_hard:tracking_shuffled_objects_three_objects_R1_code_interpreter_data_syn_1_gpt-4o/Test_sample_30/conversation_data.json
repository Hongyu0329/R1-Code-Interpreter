At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a yellow present, Bob has a orange ball, and Claire has a green present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Claire and Bob swap their gifts. Then, Alice and Claire swap their gifts. Finally, Bob and Alice swap their gifts.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges among Alice, Bob, and Claire. Initially, the distribution of gifts is as follows:\n\n- Alice has a yellow present.\n- Bob has an orange ball.\n- Claire has a green present.\n\nLet's go through each swap step by step:\n\n1. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Before the swap: Claire has a green present, Bob has an orange ball.\n   - After the swap: Claire has an orange ball, Bob has a green present.\n\n2. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Before the swap: Alice has a yellow present, Claire has an orange ball.\n   - After the swap: Alice has an orange ball, Claire has a yellow present.\n\n3. **Third Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Before the swap: Bob has a green present, Alice has an orange ball.\n   - After the swap: Bob has an orange ball, Alice has a green present.\n\nAfter all the swaps, Alice ends up with the green present. Let's confirm this with a simple Python script to simulate the swaps.\n\n```python\n# Initial gifts\nalice_gift = \"yellow present\"\nbob_gift = \"orange ball\"\nclaire_gift = \"green present\"\n\n# First swap: Claire and Bob\nclaire_gift, bob_gift = bob_gift, claire_gift\n\n# Second swap: Alice and Claire\nalice_gift, claire_gift = claire_gift, alice_gift\n\n# Third swap: Bob and Alice\nbob_gift, alice_gift = alice_gift, bob_gift\n\n# Final gift with Alice\nprint(alice_gift)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the final gift Alice has.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the swaps, Alice ends up with the green present. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) green present>>>"
