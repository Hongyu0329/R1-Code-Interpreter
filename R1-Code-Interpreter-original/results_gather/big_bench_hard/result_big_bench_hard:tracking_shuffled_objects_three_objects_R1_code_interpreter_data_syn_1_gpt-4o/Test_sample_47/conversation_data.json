    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Ownership:**\n   - Alice: Frankenstein\n   - Bob: The Odyssey\n   - Claire: The Great Gatsby\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives Frankenstein to Claire.\n   - Claire gives The Great Gatsby to Alice.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice: The Great Gatsby\n     - Bob: The Odyssey\n     - Claire: Frankenstein\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice gives The Great Gatsby to Bob.\n   - Bob gives The Odyssey to Alice.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice: The Odyssey\n     - Bob: The Great Gatsby\n     - Claire: Frankenstein\n\n4. **Third Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives The Odyssey to Claire.\n   - Claire gives Frankenstein to Alice.\n   - Final Ownership:\n     - Alice: Frankenstein\n     - Bob: The Great Gatsby\n     - Claire: The Odyssey\n\nAt the end of the semester, Claire has \"The Odyssey.\"\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to simulate the swaps:\n\n```python\n# Initial book ownership\nalice_book = \"Frankenstein\"\nbob_book = \"The Odyssey\"\nclaire_book = \"The Great Gatsby\"\n\n# First swap: Alice and Claire\nalice_book, claire_book = claire_book, alice_book\n\n# Second swap: Alice and Bob\nalice_book, bob_book = bob_book, alice_book\n\n# Third swap: Alice and Claire\nalice_book, claire_book = claire_book, alice_book\n\n# Final book with Claire\nprint(claire_book)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final book Claire has.",
    "The code execution confirms that at the end of the semester, Claire has \"The Odyssey.\"\n\n<<<B>>>"
