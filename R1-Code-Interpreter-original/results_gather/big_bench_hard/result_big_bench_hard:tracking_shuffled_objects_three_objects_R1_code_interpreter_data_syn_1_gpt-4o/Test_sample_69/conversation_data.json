    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of Alice, Bob, and Claire as they swap positions during the match. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: Cheerleader\n   - Bob: Right Winger\n   - Claire: Fullback\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice takes Claire's position (Fullback)\n   - Claire takes Alice's position (Cheerleader)\n   - New Positions:\n     - Alice: Fullback\n     - Bob: Right Winger\n     - Claire: Cheerleader\n\n3. **Second Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob takes Claire's position (Cheerleader)\n   - Claire takes Bob's position (Right Winger)\n   - New Positions:\n     - Alice: Fullback\n     - Bob: Cheerleader\n     - Claire: Right Winger\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice takes Claire's position (Right Winger)\n   - Claire takes Alice's position (Fullback)\n   - Final Positions:\n     - Alice: Right Winger\n     - Bob: Cheerleader\n     - Claire: Fullback\n\nAfter these swaps, Claire ends up in the position of Fullback. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) fullback>>>"
