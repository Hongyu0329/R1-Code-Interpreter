  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Sam, Bob is dancing with Lola, and Claire is dancing with Karl.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Bob and Alice switch partners. Then, Bob and Claire switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Sam\n(B) Lola\n(C) Karl\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice is with Sam.\n   - Bob is with Lola.\n   - Claire is with Karl.\n\n2. **First Switch (Bob and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Lola (Bob's partner).\n   - Bob is now with Sam (Alice's partner).\n   - Claire remains with Karl.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Bob is now with Karl (Claire's partner).\n   - Claire is now with Sam (Bob's partner).\n   - Alice remains with Lola.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Karl (Bob's partner).\n   - Bob is now with Lola (Alice's partner).\n   - Claire remains with Sam.\n\nAt the end of these switches, Claire is dancing with Sam.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to track the changes:\n\n```python\n# Initial partners\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Sam',\n    'Bob': 'Lola',\n    'Claire': 'Karl'\n}\n\n# First switch: Bob and Alice switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Bob'] = partners['Bob'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Second switch: Bob and Claire switch partners\npartners['Bob'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Bob']\n\n# Third switch: Alice and Bob switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Bob'] = partners['Bob'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Final partner of Claire\nprint(partners['Claire'])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final partner of Claire.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the partner switches, Claire is dancing with Sam. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
