    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them according to the given sequence of trades.\n\nInitially:\n- Alice has \"Hound of the Baskervilles\"\n- Bob has \"Frankenstein\"\n- Claire has \"Lolita\"\n\nLet's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **First Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives \"Frankenstein\" to Claire.\n   - Claire gives \"Lolita\" to Bob.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has \"Hound of the Baskervilles\"\n     - Bob has \"Lolita\"\n     - Claire has \"Frankenstein\"\n\n2. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives \"Hound of the Baskervilles\" to Claire.\n   - Claire gives \"Frankenstein\" to Alice.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has \"Frankenstein\"\n     - Bob has \"Lolita\"\n     - Claire has \"Hound of the Baskervilles\"\n\n3. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives \"Hound of the Baskervilles\" to Bob.\n   - Bob gives \"Lolita\" to Claire.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has \"Frankenstein\"\n     - Bob has \"Hound of the Baskervilles\"\n     - Claire has \"Lolita\"\n\nAt the end of the semester, Bob has \"Hound of the Baskervilles\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A) Hound of the Baskervilles>>>"
