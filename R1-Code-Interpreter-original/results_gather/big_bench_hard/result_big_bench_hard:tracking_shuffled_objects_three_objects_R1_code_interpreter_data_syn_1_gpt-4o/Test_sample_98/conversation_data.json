  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are holding a white elephant gift exchange. At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a green present, Bob has a blue present, and Claire has a brown present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Claire and Alice swap their gifts. Then, Claire and Bob swap their gifts. Finally, Alice and Claire swap their gifts. At the end of the event, Claire has the\nOptions:\n(A) green present\n(B) blue present\n(C) brown present\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges and determine which present Claire ends up with. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Green\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Brown\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice and Claire swap their gifts.\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Green\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire and Bob swap their gifts.\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Green\n   - Claire: Blue\n\n4. **Third Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice and Claire swap their gifts.\n   - Alice: Blue\n   - Bob: Green\n   - Claire: Brown\n\nAfter the final swap, Claire ends up with the brown present. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C) brown present>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are holding a white elephant gift exchange.
