  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are holding a white elephant gift exchange. At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a yellow present, Bob has a brown present, and Claire has a blue present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Bob and Alice swap their gifts. Then, Claire and Alice swap their gifts. Finally, Bob and Alice swap their gifts. At the end of the event, Claire has the\nOptions:\n(A) yellow present\n(B) brown present\n(C) blue present\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges among Alice, Bob, and Claire. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Yellow\n   - Bob: Brown\n   - Claire: Blue\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Yellow\n   - Claire: Blue\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice: Blue\n   - Bob: Yellow\n   - Claire: Brown\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice: Yellow\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Brown\n\nAfter these swaps, we need to determine which present Claire has. Let's implement this logic in a Python script to verify the final state.\n\n```python\n# Initial gifts\nalice = \"yellow\"\nbob = \"brown\"\nclaire = \"blue\"\n\n# First swap (Bob and Alice)\nalice, bob = bob, alice\n\n# Second swap (Claire and Alice)\nalice, claire = claire, alice\n\n# Third swap (Bob and Alice)\nalice, bob = bob, alice\n\n# Output the final gift Claire has\nprint(claire)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find out which present Claire ends up with.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the swaps, Claire ends up with the brown present. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B) brown present>>>"
