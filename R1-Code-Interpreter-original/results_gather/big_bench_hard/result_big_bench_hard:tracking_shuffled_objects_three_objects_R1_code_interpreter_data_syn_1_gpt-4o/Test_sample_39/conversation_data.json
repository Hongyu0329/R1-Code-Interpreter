  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Lola, Bob is dancing with Patrick, and Claire is dancing with Melissa.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Alice and Claire switch partners. Then, Bob and Claire switch partners. Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners. At the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Lola\n(B) Patrick\n(C) Melissa\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice is with Lola.\n   - Bob is with Patrick.\n   - Claire is with Melissa.\n\n2. **First Switch (Alice and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Melissa.\n   - Claire is now with Lola.\n   - Bob is still with Patrick.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Bob is now with Lola.\n   - Claire is now with Patrick.\n   - Alice is still with Melissa.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Claire and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Claire is now with Melissa.\n   - Alice is now with Patrick.\n   - Bob is still with Lola.\n\nAfter these switches, we need to determine who Bob is dancing with. Let's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial partners\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Lola',\n    'Bob': 'Patrick',\n    'Claire': 'Melissa'\n}\n\n# First switch: Alice and Claire switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Second switch: Bob and Claire switch partners\npartners['Bob'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Bob']\n\n# Third switch: Claire and Alice switch partners\npartners['Claire'], partners['Alice'] = partners['Alice'], partners['Claire']\n\n# Output Bob's partner\nprint(partners['Bob'])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final partner of Bob.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the partner switches, Bob is dancing with Lola. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
