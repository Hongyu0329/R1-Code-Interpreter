    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the balls as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them according to the given sequence of trades.\n\nInitially:\n- Alice has the yellow ball.\n- Bob has the green ball.\n- Claire has the blue ball.\n\nLet's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **First Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice gives her yellow ball to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his green ball to Alice.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has the green ball.\n     - Bob has the yellow ball.\n     - Claire still has the blue ball.\n\n2. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives her green ball to Claire.\n   - Claire gives her blue ball to Alice.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has the blue ball.\n     - Bob has the yellow ball.\n     - Claire has the green ball.\n\n3. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives her green ball to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his yellow ball to Claire.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has the blue ball.\n     - Bob has the green ball.\n     - Claire has the yellow ball.\n\nAt the end of the game, Bob has the green ball. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
