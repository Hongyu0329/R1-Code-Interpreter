  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Izzi, Bob is dancing with Melissa, and Claire is dancing with Lola.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Claire and Alice switch partners. Then, Bob and Claire switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Izzi\n(B) Melissa\n(C) Lola\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Partners:**\n   - Alice is with Izzi.\n   - Bob is with Melissa.\n   - Claire is with Lola.\n\n2. **First Switch (Claire and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Lola (Claire's initial partner).\n   - Claire is now with Izzi (Alice's initial partner).\n   - Bob remains with Melissa.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Bob is now with Izzi (Claire's current partner).\n   - Claire is now with Melissa (Bob's initial partner).\n   - Alice remains with Lola.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Izzi (Bob's current partner).\n   - Bob is now with Lola (Alice's current partner).\n   - Claire remains with Melissa.\n\nAfter these switches, Alice ends up dancing with Izzi.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to track the changes:\n\n```python\n# Initial partners\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Izzi',\n    'Bob': 'Melissa',\n    'Claire': 'Lola'\n}\n\n# First switch: Claire and Alice switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Second switch: Bob and Claire switch partners\npartners['Bob'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Bob']\n\n# Third switch: Alice and Bob switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Bob'] = partners['Bob'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Final partner of Alice\nprint(partners['Alice'])\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the final partner of Alice.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the partner switches, Alice ends up dancing with Izzi. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
