  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are holding a white elephant gift exchange. At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a orange ball, Bob has a purple present, and Claire has a blue present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Claire and Bob swap their gifts. Then, Claire and Alice swap their gifts. Finally, Bob and Alice swap their gifts. At the end of the event, Alice has the\nOptions:\n(A) orange ball\n(B) purple present\n(C) blue present\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges among Alice, Bob, and Claire. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: orange ball\n   - Bob: purple present\n   - Claire: blue present\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives her blue present to Bob and receives Bob's purple present.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: orange ball\n     - Bob: blue present\n     - Claire: purple present\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire gives her purple present to Alice and receives Alice's orange ball.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: purple present\n     - Bob: blue present\n     - Claire: orange ball\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Bob gives his blue present to Alice and receives Alice's purple present.\n   - Final State:\n     - Alice: blue present\n     - Bob: purple present\n     - Claire: orange ball\n\nAfter following these steps, we can determine what Alice has at the end of the event. Let's confirm this with a simple Python script to simulate the swaps.\n\n```python\n# Initial gifts\nalice = \"orange ball\"\nbob = \"purple present\"\nclaire = \"blue present\"\n\n# First swap: Claire and Bob\nclaire, bob = bob, claire\n\n# Second swap: Claire and Alice\nclaire, alice = alice, claire\n\n# Third swap: Bob and Alice\nbob, alice = alice, bob\n\n# Final gift with Alice\nprint(alice)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final gift that Alice has.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the swaps, Alice ends up with the blue present. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n<<<C) blue present>>>"
