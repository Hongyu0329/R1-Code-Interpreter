    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Ownership:**\n   - Alice has \"Lolita\"\n   - Bob has \"Catch-22\"\n   - Claire has \"The Great Gatsby\"\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives \"Lolita\" to Claire and receives \"The Great Gatsby\" from Claire.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"The Great Gatsby\"\n     - Bob has \"Catch-22\"\n     - Claire has \"Lolita\"\n\n3. **Second Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Bob gives \"Catch-22\" to Alice and receives \"The Great Gatsby\" from Alice.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"Catch-22\"\n     - Bob has \"The Great Gatsby\"\n     - Claire has \"Lolita\"\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire gives \"Lolita\" to Alice and receives \"Catch-22\" from Alice.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"Lolita\"\n     - Bob has \"The Great Gatsby\"\n     - Claire has \"Catch-22\"\n\nAt the end of the semester, Bob has \"The Great Gatsby\". Therefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
