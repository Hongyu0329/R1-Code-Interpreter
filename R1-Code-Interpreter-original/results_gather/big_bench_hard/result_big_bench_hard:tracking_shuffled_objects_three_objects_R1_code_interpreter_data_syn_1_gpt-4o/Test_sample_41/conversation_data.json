At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing fullback, Bob is playing goalkeeper, and Claire is playing right winger.\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Claire and Bob trade positions. Then, Alice and Claire trade positions. Finally, Alice and Bob trade positions.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of Alice, Bob, and Claire as they swap positions during the match. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: Fullback\n   - Bob: Goalkeeper\n   - Claire: Right Winger\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Fullback\n   - Bob: Right Winger (swaps with Claire)\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper (swaps with Bob)\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice: Goalkeeper (swaps with Claire)\n   - Bob: Right Winger\n   - Claire: Fullback (swaps with Alice)\n\n4. **Third Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Right Winger (swaps with Bob)\n   - Bob: Goalkeeper (swaps with Alice)\n   - Claire: Fullback\n\nAfter these swaps, Claire ends up playing the position of Fullback. Therefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
