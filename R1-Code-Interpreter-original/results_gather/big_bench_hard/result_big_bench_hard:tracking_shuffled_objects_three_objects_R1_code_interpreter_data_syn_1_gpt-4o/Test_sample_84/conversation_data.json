  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Patrick, Bob is dancing with Karl, and Claire is dancing with Izzi.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Bob and Claire switch partners. Then, Claire and Alice switch partners. Finally, Claire and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Patrick\n(B) Karl\n(C) Izzi\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Partners:**\n   - Alice is with Patrick.\n   - Bob is with Karl.\n   - Claire is with Izzi.\n\n2. **First Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Alice is still with Patrick.\n   - Bob is now with Izzi.\n   - Claire is now with Karl.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Claire and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Karl.\n   - Bob is still with Izzi.\n   - Claire is now with Patrick.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Claire and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is still with Karl.\n   - Bob is now with Patrick.\n   - Claire is now with Izzi.\n\nAfter these steps, Alice ends up dancing with Karl. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) Karl.\n\n<<<B) Karl>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
