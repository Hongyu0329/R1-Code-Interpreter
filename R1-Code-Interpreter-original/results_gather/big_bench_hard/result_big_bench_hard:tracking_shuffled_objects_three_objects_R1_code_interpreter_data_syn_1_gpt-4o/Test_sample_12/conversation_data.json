    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges among Alice, Bob, and Claire. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Red present\n   - Bob: Black ball\n   - Claire: White present\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives her red present to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his black ball to Alice.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: Black ball\n     - Bob: Red present\n     - Claire: White present\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives her white present to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his red present to Claire.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: Black ball\n     - Bob: White present\n     - Claire: Red present\n\n4. **Third Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives her black ball to Claire.\n   - Claire gives her red present to Alice.\n   - Final State:\n     - Alice: Red present\n     - Bob: White present\n     - Claire: Black ball\n\nAt the end of the event, Bob has the white present. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C) white present>>>"
