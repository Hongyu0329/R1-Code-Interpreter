At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a orange ball, Bob has a purple present, and Claire has a red present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Claire and Bob swap their gifts. Then, Alice and Bob swap their gifts. Finally, Claire and Alice swap their gifts.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges among Alice, Bob, and Claire. We will follow the swaps step by step to determine which gift Claire ends up with.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: orange ball\n   - Bob: purple present\n   - Claire: red present\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives her red present to Bob and receives Bob's purple present.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: orange ball\n     - Bob: red present\n     - Claire: purple present\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice gives her orange ball to Bob and receives Bob's red present.\n   - New State:\n     - Alice: red present\n     - Bob: orange ball\n     - Claire: purple present\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire gives her purple present to Alice and receives Alice's red present.\n   - Final State:\n     - Alice: purple present\n     - Bob: orange ball\n     - Claire: red present\n\nAfter following all the swaps, Claire ends up with the red present. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C) red present>>>"
