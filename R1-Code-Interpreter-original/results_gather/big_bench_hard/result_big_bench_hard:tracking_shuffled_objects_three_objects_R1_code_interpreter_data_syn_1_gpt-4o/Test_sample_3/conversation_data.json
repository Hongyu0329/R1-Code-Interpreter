  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Helga, Bob is dancing with Lola, and Claire is dancing with Ophelia.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Alice and Bob switch partners. Then, Bob and Claire switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Helga\n(B) Lola\n(C) Ophelia\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Partners:**\n   - Alice is with Helga.\n   - Bob is with Lola.\n   - Claire is with Ophelia.\n\n2. **First Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice takes Bob's partner, Lola.\n   - Bob takes Alice's partner, Helga.\n   - Claire remains with Ophelia.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Bob takes Claire's partner, Ophelia.\n   - Claire takes Bob's partner, Helga.\n   - Alice remains with Lola.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners again):**\n   - Alice takes Bob's partner, Ophelia.\n   - Bob takes Alice's partner, Lola.\n   - Claire remains with Helga.\n\nAfter these switches, Alice ends up dancing with Ophelia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) Ophelia>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
