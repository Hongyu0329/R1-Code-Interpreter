    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step according to the given sequence of switches.\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice is with Ophelia.\n   - Bob is with Lola.\n   - Claire is with Izzi.\n\n2. **First Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Bob takes Claire's partner, Izzi.\n   - Claire takes Bob's partner, Lola.\n   - New pairings:\n     - Alice is with Ophelia.\n     - Bob is with Izzi.\n     - Claire is with Lola.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Claire and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Claire takes Alice's partner, Ophelia.\n   - Alice takes Claire's partner, Lola.\n   - New pairings:\n     - Alice is with Lola.\n     - Bob is with Izzi.\n     - Claire is with Ophelia.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice takes Bob's partner, Izzi.\n   - Bob takes Alice's partner, Lola.\n   - Final pairings:\n     - Alice is with Izzi.\n     - Bob is with Lola.\n     - Claire is with Ophelia.\n\nNow, let's determine who Alice is dancing with at the end of the dance.\n\nAlice ends up dancing with Izzi. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C) Izzi.\n\n<<<C) Izzi>>>"
