  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are on the same team in a soccer match. At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing cheerleader, Bob is playing benchwarmer, and Claire is playing left winger.\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Claire and Bob trade positions. Then, Claire and Alice trade positions. Finally, Claire and Bob trade positions. At the end of the match, Claire is playing\nOptions:\n(A) cheerleader\n(B) benchwarmer\n(C) left winger\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the position swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: Cheerleader\n   - Bob: Benchwarmer\n   - Claire: Left Winger\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Cheerleader\n   - Bob: Left Winger\n   - Claire: Benchwarmer\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice: Benchwarmer\n   - Bob: Left Winger\n   - Claire: Cheerleader\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Benchwarmer\n   - Bob: Cheerleader\n   - Claire: Left Winger\n\nAfter these swaps, Claire ends up in the position of Left Winger.\n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure the swaps are correctly tracked.\n\n```python\n# Initial positions\npositions = {\n    \"Alice\": \"cheerleader\",\n    \"Bob\": \"benchwarmer\",\n    \"Claire\": \"left winger\"\n}\n\n# First swap: Claire and Bob\npositions[\"Claire\"], positions[\"Bob\"] = positions[\"Bob\"], positions[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Second swap: Claire and Alice\npositions[\"Claire\"], positions[\"Alice\"] = positions[\"Alice\"], positions[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Third swap: Claire and Bob\npositions[\"Claire\"], positions[\"Bob\"] = positions[\"Bob\"], positions[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Final position of Claire\nprint(positions[\"Claire\"])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final position of Claire.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the swaps, Claire ends up in the position of \"left winger.\" Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) left winger>>>"
