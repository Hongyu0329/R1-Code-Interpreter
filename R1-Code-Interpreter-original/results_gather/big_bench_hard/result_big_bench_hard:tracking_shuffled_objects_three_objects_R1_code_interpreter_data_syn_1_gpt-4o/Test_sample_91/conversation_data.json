At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing center midfielder, Bob is playing benchwarmer, and Claire is playing fullback.\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Alice and Claire trade positions. Then, Alice and Bob trade positions. Finally, Alice and Claire trade positions.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of Alice, Bob, and Claire as they swap positions during the match. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: Center Midfielder\n   - Bob: Benchwarmer\n   - Claire: Fullback\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice takes Claire's position (Fullback)\n   - Claire takes Alice's position (Center Midfielder)\n   - Bob remains Benchwarmer\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice takes Bob's position (Benchwarmer)\n   - Bob takes Alice's position (Fullback)\n   - Claire remains Center Midfielder\n\n4. **Third Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice takes Claire's position (Center Midfielder)\n   - Claire takes Alice's position (Benchwarmer)\n   - Bob remains Fullback\n\nAfter these swaps, we need to determine Bob's final position. Let's summarize the final positions:\n\n- Alice: Center Midfielder\n- Bob: Fullback\n- Claire: Benchwarmer\n\nBob's final position is Fullback. Therefore, the correct option is (C) fullback.\n\n<<<C) fullback>>>"
