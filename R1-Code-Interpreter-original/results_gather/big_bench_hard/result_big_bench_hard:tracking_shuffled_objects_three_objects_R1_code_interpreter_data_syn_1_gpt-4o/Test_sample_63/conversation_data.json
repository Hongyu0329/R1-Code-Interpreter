    "To solve this problem, we need to track the position changes of Alice, Bob, and Claire as they swap positions during the match. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Left Midfielder\n   - Claire: Fullback\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice takes Claire's position (Fullback).\n   - Claire takes Alice's position (Goalkeeper).\n\n   New Positions:\n   - Alice: Fullback\n   - Bob: Left Midfielder\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice takes Bob's position (Left Midfielder).\n   - Bob takes Alice's position (Fullback).\n\n   New Positions:\n   - Alice: Left Midfielder\n   - Bob: Fullback\n   - Claire: Goalkeeper\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob takes Claire's position (Goalkeeper).\n   - Claire takes Bob's position (Fullback).\n\n   Final Positions:\n   - Alice: Left Midfielder\n   - Bob: Goalkeeper\n   - Claire: Fullback\n\nAt the end of the match, Claire is playing as a Fullback. Therefore, the correct option is (C) fullback.\n\n<<<C) fullback>>>"
