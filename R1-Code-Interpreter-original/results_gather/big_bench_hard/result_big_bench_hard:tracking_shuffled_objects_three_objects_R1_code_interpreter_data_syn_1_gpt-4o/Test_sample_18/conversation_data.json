At the start of the match, they are each assigned to a position: Alice is playing cheerleader, Bob is playing right winger, and Claire is playing benchwarmer.\nAs the game progresses, pairs of players occasionally swap positions. First, Alice and Claire trade positions. Then, Bob and Claire trade positions. Finally, Alice and Bob trade positions.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of Alice, Bob, and Claire as they swap positions during the match. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: cheerleader\n   - Bob: right winger\n   - Claire: benchwarmer\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice and Claire trade positions.\n   - Alice: benchwarmer\n   - Bob: right winger\n   - Claire: cheerleader\n\n3. **Second Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob and Claire trade positions.\n   - Alice: benchwarmer\n   - Bob: cheerleader\n   - Claire: right winger\n\n4. **Third Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice and Bob trade positions.\n   - Alice: cheerleader\n   - Bob: benchwarmer\n   - Claire: right winger\n\nAfter these swaps, Alice ends up in the position of a cheerleader. Therefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
