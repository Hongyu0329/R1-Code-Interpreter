  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are holding a white elephant gift exchange. At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a yellow present, Bob has a white present, and Claire has a purple present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Alice and Bob swap their gifts. Then, Bob and Claire swap their gifts. Finally, Bob and Alice swap their gifts. At the end of the event, Bob has the\nOptions:\n(A) yellow present\n(B) white present\n(C) purple present\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges and determine which present Bob ends up with.\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Yellow\n   - Bob: White\n   - Claire: Purple\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice: White\n   - Bob: Yellow\n   - Claire: Purple\n\n3. **Second Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Alice: White\n   - Bob: Purple\n   - Claire: Yellow\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice: Purple\n   - Bob: White\n   - Claire: Yellow\n\nAfter these swaps, Bob ends up with the white present. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B) white present>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are holding a white elephant gift exchange.
