  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Ophelia, Bob is dancing with Rodrigo, and Claire is dancing with Karl.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Bob and Claire switch partners. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Ophelia\n(B) Rodrigo\n(C) Karl\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Partners:**\n   - Alice is with Ophelia.\n   - Bob is with Rodrigo.\n   - Claire is with Karl.\n\n2. **First Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Bob takes Claire's partner, Karl.\n   - Claire takes Bob's partner, Rodrigo.\n   - New partners:\n     - Alice is with Ophelia.\n     - Bob is with Karl.\n     - Claire is with Rodrigo.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice takes Bob's partner, Karl.\n   - Bob takes Alice's partner, Ophelia.\n   - New partners:\n     - Alice is with Karl.\n     - Bob is with Ophelia.\n     - Claire is with Rodrigo.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Bob and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Bob takes Claire's partner, Rodrigo.\n   - Claire takes Bob's partner, Ophelia.\n   - Final partners:\n     - Alice is with Karl.\n     - Bob is with Rodrigo.\n     - Claire is with Ophelia.\n\nAfter following these steps, we find that at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Karl.\n\n<<<C) Karl>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
