    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Ownership:**\n   - Alice has \"Frankenstein\"\n   - Bob has \"Moby Dick\"\n   - Claire has \"The Fellowship of the Ring\"\n\n2. **First Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice gives \"Frankenstein\" to Bob and receives \"Moby Dick\" from Bob.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"Moby Dick\"\n     - Bob has \"Frankenstein\"\n     - Claire has \"The Fellowship of the Ring\"\n\n3. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire gives \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" to Alice and receives \"Moby Dick\" from Alice.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"The Fellowship of the Ring\"\n     - Bob has \"Frankenstein\"\n     - Claire has \"Moby Dick\"\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives \"Frankenstein\" to Claire and receives \"Moby Dick\" from Claire.\n   - Final Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"The Fellowship of the Ring\"\n     - Bob has \"Moby Dick\"\n     - Claire has \"Frankenstein\"\n\nAt the end of the semester, Alice has \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". Therefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C) The Fellowship of the Ring>>>"
