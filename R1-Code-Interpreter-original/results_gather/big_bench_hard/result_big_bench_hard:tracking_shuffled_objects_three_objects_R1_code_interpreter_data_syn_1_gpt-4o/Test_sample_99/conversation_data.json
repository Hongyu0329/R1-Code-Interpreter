    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them according to the given sequence of trades.\n\n1. **Initial Ownership:**\n   - Alice has \"Frankenstein\"\n   - Bob has \"The Pearl\"\n   - Claire has \"The Odyssey\"\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives \"Frankenstein\" to Bob and receives \"The Pearl\" from Bob.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"The Pearl\"\n     - Bob has \"Frankenstein\"\n     - Claire has \"The Odyssey\"\n\n3. **Second Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives \"Frankenstein\" to Claire and receives \"The Odyssey\" from Claire.\n   - New Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"The Pearl\"\n     - Bob has \"The Odyssey\"\n     - Claire has \"Frankenstein\"\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives \"The Pearl\" to Bob and receives \"The Odyssey\" from Bob.\n   - Final Ownership:\n     - Alice has \"The Odyssey\"\n     - Bob has \"The Pearl\"\n     - Claire has \"Frankenstein\"\n\nNow, let's determine which book Alice has at the end of the semester. Based on the final ownership, Alice has \"The Odyssey.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) The Odyssey>>>"
