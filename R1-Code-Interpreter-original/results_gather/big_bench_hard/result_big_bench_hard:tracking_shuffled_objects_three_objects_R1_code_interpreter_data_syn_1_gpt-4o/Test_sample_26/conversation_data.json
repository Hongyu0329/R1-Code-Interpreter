  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are holding a white elephant gift exchange. At the start of the event, they are each holding a present of a different color: Alice has a pink ball, Bob has a orange ball, and Claire has a white present.\nAs the event progresses, pairs of people swap gifts. First, Bob and Claire swap their gifts. Then, Alice and Claire swap their gifts. Finally, Bob and Claire swap their gifts. At the end of the event, Bob has the\nOptions:\n(A) pink ball\n(B) orange ball\n(C) white present\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges between Alice, Bob, and Claire. We will follow the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Alice: Pink ball\n   - Bob: Orange ball\n   - Claire: White present\n\n2. **First Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives his orange ball to Claire and receives the white present from Claire.\n   - Alice: Pink ball\n   - Bob: White present\n   - Claire: Orange ball\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives her pink ball to Claire and receives the orange ball from Claire.\n   - Alice: Orange ball\n   - Bob: White present\n   - Claire: Pink ball\n\n4. **Third Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives his white present to Claire and receives the pink ball from Claire.\n   - Alice: Orange ball\n   - Bob: Pink ball\n   - Claire: White present\n\nAfter these swaps, Bob ends up with the pink ball. Therefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
