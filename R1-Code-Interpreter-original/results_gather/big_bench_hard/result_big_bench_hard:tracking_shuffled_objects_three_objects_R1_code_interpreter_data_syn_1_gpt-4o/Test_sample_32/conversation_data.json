  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Rodrigo, Bob is dancing with Sam, and Claire is dancing with Lola.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Claire and Bob switch partners. Then, Bob and Alice switch partners. Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners. At the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Rodrigo\n(B) Sam\n(C) Lola\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Partners:**\n   - Alice is with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is with Sam.\n   - Claire is with Lola.\n\n2. **First Switch (Claire and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is still with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is now with Lola.\n   - Claire is now with Sam.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Bob and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Lola.\n   - Bob is now with Rodrigo.\n   - Claire is still with Sam.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Claire and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Sam.\n   - Bob is still with Rodrigo.\n   - Claire is now with Lola.\n\nAfter these switches, Claire ends up dancing with Lola.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to track the partner changes:\n\n```python\n# Initial partners\npartners = {\n    \"Alice\": \"Rodrigo\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Sam\",\n    \"Claire\": \"Lola\"\n}\n\n# First switch: Claire and Bob switch partners\npartners[\"Claire\"], partners[\"Bob\"] = partners[\"Bob\"], partners[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Second switch: Bob and Alice switch partners\npartners[\"Bob\"], partners[\"Alice\"] = partners[\"Alice\"], partners[\"Bob\"]\n\n# Third switch: Claire and Alice switch partners\npartners[\"Claire\"], partners[\"Alice\"] = partners[\"Alice\"], partners[\"Claire\"]\n\n# Final partner of Claire\nprint(partners[\"Claire\"])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final partner of Claire.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the partner switches, Claire ends up dancing with Lola. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) Lola>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
