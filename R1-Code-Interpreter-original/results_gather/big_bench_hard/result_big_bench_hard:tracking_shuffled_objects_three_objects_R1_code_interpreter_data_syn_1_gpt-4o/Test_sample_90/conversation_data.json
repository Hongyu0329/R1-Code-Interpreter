    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of ball swaps between Alice, Bob, and Claire.\n\nInitially:\n- Alice has a green ball.\n- Bob has a black ball.\n- Claire has a blue ball.\n\nLet's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **First Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives her green ball to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his black ball to Alice.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has a black ball.\n     - Bob has a green ball.\n     - Claire has a blue ball.\n\n2. **Second Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice gives her black ball to Claire.\n   - Claire gives her blue ball to Alice.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has a blue ball.\n     - Bob has a green ball.\n     - Claire has a black ball.\n\n3. **Third Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice gives her blue ball to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his green ball to Alice.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has a green ball.\n     - Bob has a blue ball.\n     - Claire has a black ball.\n\nAt the end of the game, Bob has the blue ball.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) blue ball>>>"
