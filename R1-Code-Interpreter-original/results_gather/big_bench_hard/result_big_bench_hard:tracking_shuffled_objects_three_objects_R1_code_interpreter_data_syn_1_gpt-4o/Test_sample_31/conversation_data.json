At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Jamie, Bob is dancing with Patrick, and Claire is dancing with Melissa.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Claire and Bob switch partners. Then, Bob and Alice switch partners. Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice is with Jamie.\n   - Bob is with Patrick.\n   - Claire is with Melissa.\n\n2. **First Switch (Claire and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is still with Jamie.\n   - Bob is now with Melissa.\n   - Claire is now with Patrick.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Bob and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Melissa.\n   - Bob is now with Jamie.\n   - Claire is still with Patrick.\n\n4. **Third Switch (Alice and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Patrick.\n   - Bob is still with Jamie.\n   - Claire is now with Melissa.\n\nAfter these switches, Claire ends up dancing with Melissa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Melissa.\n\n<<<C) Melissa>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
