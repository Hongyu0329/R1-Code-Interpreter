    "To solve this problem, we need to track the positions of Alice, Bob, and Claire as they swap positions during the match. Let's break down the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Left Winger\n   - Claire: Center Midfielder\n\n2. **First Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Goalkeeper\n   - Bob: Center Midfielder (swapped with Claire)\n   - Claire: Left Winger (swapped with Bob)\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Center Midfielder (swapped with Bob)\n   - Bob: Goalkeeper (swapped with Alice)\n   - Claire: Left Winger\n\n4. **Third Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Alice: Left Winger (swapped with Claire)\n   - Bob: Goalkeeper\n   - Claire: Center Midfielder (swapped with Alice)\n\nAfter these swaps, Alice ends up playing as the Left Winger. Therefore, the correct option is (B) left winger.\n\n<<<B) left winger>>>"
