  "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance. At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Helga, Bob is dancing with Patrick, and Claire is dancing with Sam.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Claire and Alice switch partners. Then, Claire and Bob switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Helga\n(B) Patrick\n(C) Sam\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Pairings:**\n   - Alice is with Helga.\n   - Bob is with Patrick.\n   - Claire is with Sam.\n\n2. **First Switch (Claire and Alice switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Sam (Claire's original partner).\n   - Claire is now with Helga (Alice's original partner).\n   - Bob is still with Patrick.\n\n3. **Second Switch (Claire and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is still with Sam.\n   - Claire is now with Patrick (Bob's original partner).\n   - Bob is now with Helga (Claire's current partner).\n\n4. **Third Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Helga (Bob's current partner).\n   - Bob is now with Sam (Alice's current partner).\n   - Claire is still with Patrick.\n\nAfter these switches, Alice ends up dancing with Helga.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to track the changes:\n\n```python\n# Initial partners\npartners = {\n    'Alice': 'Helga',\n    'Bob': 'Patrick',\n    'Claire': 'Sam'\n}\n\n# First switch: Claire and Alice switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Claire'] = partners['Claire'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Second switch: Claire and Bob switch partners\npartners['Claire'], partners['Bob'] = partners['Bob'], partners['Claire']\n\n# Third switch: Alice and Bob switch partners\npartners['Alice'], partners['Bob'] = partners['Bob'], partners['Alice']\n\n# Final partner of Alice\nprint(partners['Alice'])\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the final partner of Alice.",
    "The code execution confirms that after all the partner switches, Alice ends up dancing with Helga. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
