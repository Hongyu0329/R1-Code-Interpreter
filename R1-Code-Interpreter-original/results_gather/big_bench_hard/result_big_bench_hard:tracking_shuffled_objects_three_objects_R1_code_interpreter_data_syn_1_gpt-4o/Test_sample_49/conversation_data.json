    "To solve this problem, we need to track the sequence of gift exchanges among Alice, Bob, and Claire. Initially, the distribution of gifts is as follows:\n\n- Alice has a pink ball.\n- Bob has a black ball.\n- Claire has a purple present.\n\nLet's go through each swap step by step:\n\n1. **First Swap (Bob and Claire):**\n   - Bob gives his black ball to Claire.\n   - Claire gives her purple present to Bob.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice still has the pink ball.\n     - Bob has the purple present.\n     - Claire has the black ball.\n\n2. **Second Swap (Alice and Claire):**\n   - Alice gives her pink ball to Claire.\n   - Claire gives her black ball to Alice.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice has the black ball.\n     - Bob still has the purple present.\n     - Claire has the pink ball.\n\n3. **Third Swap (Claire and Bob):**\n   - Claire gives her pink ball to Bob.\n   - Bob gives his purple present to Claire.\n   - After this swap:\n     - Alice still has the black ball.\n     - Bob has the pink ball.\n     - Claire has the purple present.\n\nNow, we need to determine what Claire has at the end of the event. Based on the final distribution, Claire has the purple present.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C) purple present>>>"
