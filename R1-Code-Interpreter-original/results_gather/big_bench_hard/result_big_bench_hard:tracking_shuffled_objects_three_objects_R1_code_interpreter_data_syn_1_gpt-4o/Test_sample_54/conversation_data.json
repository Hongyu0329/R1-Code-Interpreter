At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Sam, Bob is dancing with Karl, and Claire is dancing with Helga.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Alice and Claire switch partners. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. Finally, Claire and Bob switch partners.

    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Partners:**\n   - Alice is with Sam.\n   - Bob is with Karl.\n   - Claire is with Helga.\n\n2. **First Switch (Alice and Claire switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Helga (Claire's partner).\n   - Claire is now with Sam (Alice's partner).\n\n3. **Second Switch (Alice and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Alice is now with Karl (Bob's partner).\n   - Bob is now with Helga (Alice's partner).\n\n4. **Third Switch (Claire and Bob switch partners):**\n   - Claire is now with Helga (Bob's partner).\n   - Bob is now with Sam (Claire's partner).\n\nAfter these switches, we need to determine who Alice is dancing with. Let's summarize the final partners:\n\n- Alice is with Karl.\n- Bob is with Sam.\n- Claire is with Helga.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Karl.\n\n<<<Karl>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Alice, Bob, and Claire are dancers at a square dance.
