    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam went to his office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. The sentence begins with \"After meeting with the producers,\" which sets the context for the action that follows. This part of the sentence does not provide any information about the ownership of the office.\n\n2. The main clause is \"Sam went to his office.\" Here, \"his\" is a possessive pronoun that refers to the owner of the office. The subject of this clause is \"Sam,\" which suggests that \"his\" most likely refers to Sam.\n\n3. There is no indication in the sentence that the office belongs to the producers. The sentence structure and typical usage imply that \"his\" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is Sam.\n\nTherefore, the most logical interpretation is that \"his office\" refers to Sam's office.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n(B) The office was Sam's office\n\n<<<B>>>"
