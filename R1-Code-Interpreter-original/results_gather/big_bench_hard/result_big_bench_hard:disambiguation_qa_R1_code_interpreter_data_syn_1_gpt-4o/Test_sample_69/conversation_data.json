    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The patient disclosed to the counselor that he had a history of substance abuse,\" we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence is structured such that \"The patient\" is the subject who is performing the action of disclosing information to \"the counselor.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"he\" is used in the clause \"that he had a history of substance abuse.\" In English, pronouns typically refer back to the most recent noun that matches in gender and number, unless context suggests otherwise.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: In this context, the patient is the one disclosing information. It is logical to assume that the information being disclosed pertains to the patient himself, as he is the subject of the action. The counselor is the recipient of the information, and there is no indication in the sentence that the counselor's history is being discussed.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the sentence structure and typical pronoun usage, \"he\" most likely refers to \"The patient.\" Therefore, the antecedent of \"he\" is \"The patient.\"\n\nThus, the correct option is (A) The patient had a history.\n\n<<<A>>>"
