    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told him a fake story.\"\n\n- The sentence has two main actions: \"tried to fool\" and \"told a fake story.\"\n- The subject of both actions is \"the writer.\"\n- The pronoun \"him\" is the object of the action \"told a fake story.\"\n\nIn this context, \"him\" refers to the person who is being told the fake story. Since the writer is the one performing the action of telling, and the salesperson is the one being fooled, it is logical to conclude that \"him\" refers to the salesperson.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) Told the salesperson a fake story\n\n<<<B>>>"
