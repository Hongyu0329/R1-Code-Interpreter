    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam went to their office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Pronoun Analysis**: The pronoun \"their\" is a possessive pronoun, which typically refers to a plural noun or a singular noun that is gender-neutral. In this sentence, \"their\" is used to indicate possession of the \"office.\"\n\n2. **Noun Reference**: The sentence mentions two potential antecedents for \"their\": \"the producers\" and \"Sam.\" \n   - \"The producers\" is a plural noun, which aligns with the plural possessive pronoun \"their.\"\n   - \"Sam\" is a singular noun, and typically, the possessive pronoun for a singular noun would be \"his\" or \"her,\" not \"their,\" unless Sam is non-binary and prefers \"they/them\" pronouns.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: Without additional context, the most straightforward interpretation is that \"their\" refers to \"the producers,\" as it is the only plural noun in the sentence. This makes option (A) the most likely choice.\n\n4. **Ambiguity Consideration**: While it is possible for \"their\" to refer to Sam if Sam uses \"they/them\" pronouns, this interpretation requires additional context not provided in the sentence. Therefore, without explicit information about Sam's pronouns, the sentence is not inherently ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"their\" is \"the producers,\" making option (A) the correct choice.\n\n<<<(A) The office was the producers' office>>>"
