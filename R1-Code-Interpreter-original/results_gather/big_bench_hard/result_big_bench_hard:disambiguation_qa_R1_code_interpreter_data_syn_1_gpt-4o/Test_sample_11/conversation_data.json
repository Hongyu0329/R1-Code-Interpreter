    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"Bailey planned to meet the director at his office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. The sentence mentions two people: Bailey and the director.\n2. The pronoun \"his\" is used to refer to a male person or a person whose gender is not specified but is traditionally male in context.\n3. The sentence structure \"Bailey planned to meet the director at his office\" suggests that the office belongs to the person being met, which is the director in this case.\n\nBased on these observations, the most logical antecedent for \"his\" is the director, as it is common to meet someone at their own office rather than at the office of the person who is planning the meeting.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(A) The office was the director's office\n\nThus, the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" is the director.\n\n<<<A>>>"
