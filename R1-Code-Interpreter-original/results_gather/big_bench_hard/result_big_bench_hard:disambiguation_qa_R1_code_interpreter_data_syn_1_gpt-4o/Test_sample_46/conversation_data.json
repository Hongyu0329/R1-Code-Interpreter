    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because they needed to understand the case.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Possible Antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured such that \"The lawyer\" is the subject of the main clause, and \"the cashier\" is the object of the prepositional phrase \"against the cashier.\"\n   - The clause \"because they needed to understand the case\" provides a reason for the action in the main clause.\n\n3. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - Typically, in English, the pronoun \"they\" would refer to the subject of the main clause unless there is a clear indication otherwise.\n   - The lawyer is the one actively looking into the accusations, which suggests that the lawyer would need to understand the case to perform their duties effectively.\n\n4. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - If there is no clear grammatical or contextual indication of which noun the pronoun refers to, the sentence could be considered ambiguous.\n   - However, given the context that the lawyer is investigating, it is more logical to conclude that \"they\" refers to \"the lawyer.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the lawyer.\"\n\n<<<(A) The lawyer needed to understand>>>"
