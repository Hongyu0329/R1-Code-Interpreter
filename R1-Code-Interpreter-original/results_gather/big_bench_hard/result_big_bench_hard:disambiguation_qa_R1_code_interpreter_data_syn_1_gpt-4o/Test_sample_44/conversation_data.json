    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but he was too late.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the investigator\" and \"the witness.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person\" and \"but he was too late.\"\n   - The conjunction \"but\" indicates a contrast or an unexpected outcome related to the first part of the sentence.\n\n3. **Determine the logical antecedent**:\n   - The first part of the sentence suggests that the investigator had an intention to interview the witness.\n   - The second part of the sentence, \"but he was too late,\" implies that the person who was too late is the one who had the intention or action in the first part.\n   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"he\" refers to \"the investigator,\" as it is the investigator who would be late in the context of wanting to conduct an interview.\n\n4. **Consider ambiguity**:\n   - If there were additional context or information that could suggest the witness was supposed to be somewhere at a specific time, it might introduce ambiguity. However, based on the given sentence alone, the most straightforward interpretation is that \"he\" refers to \"the investigator.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of \"he\" is most likely \"the investigator.\"\n\n<<<(A) The investigator was too late>>>"
