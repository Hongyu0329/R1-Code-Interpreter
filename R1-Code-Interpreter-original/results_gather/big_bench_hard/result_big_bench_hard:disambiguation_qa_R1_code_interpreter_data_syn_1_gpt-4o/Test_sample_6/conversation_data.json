    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but she was too late.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the investigator\" and \"the witness.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person\" and \"but she was too late.\"\n   - The conjunction \"but\" suggests a contrast or an unexpected outcome related to the first part of the sentence.\n\n3. **Consider the logical flow**:\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the investigator,\" the sentence implies that the investigator was too late to conduct the interview, which is a logical and coherent interpretation.\n   - If \"she\" refers to \"the witness,\" the sentence would imply that the witness was too late, but it doesn't specify what the witness was too late for, making it less clear.\n\n4. **Determine ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context to definitively determine whether \"she\" refers to \"the investigator\" or \"the witness.\"\n   - Without further context, both interpretations could be possible, but the more common interpretation would be that \"she\" refers to \"the investigator\" since the action of being too late is more directly related to the investigator's intention to conduct the interview.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence is ambiguous because it does not provide enough information to definitively determine the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
