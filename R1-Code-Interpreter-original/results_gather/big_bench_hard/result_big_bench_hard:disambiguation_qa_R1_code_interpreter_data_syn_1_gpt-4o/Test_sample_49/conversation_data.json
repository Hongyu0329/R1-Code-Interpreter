    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because she is standing in front of the door,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two parts: \"The mechanic greets the receptionist\" and \"because she is standing in front of the door.\" The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this sentence, the pronoun \"she\" is feminine and singular.\n\n3. **Noun Analysis**: The nouns in the sentence are \"mechanic\" and \"receptionist.\" The noun \"receptionist\" is the closest noun to the pronoun \"she\" and is also feminine and singular, which matches the pronoun.\n\n4. **Logical Context**: The sentence implies a reason for the greeting. It is more logical that the receptionist is standing in front of the door, as the mechanic is the one performing the action of greeting. The receptionist's position in front of the door provides a reason for the mechanic to greet her.\n\nBased on the analysis, the pronoun \"she\" most likely refers to \"the receptionist.\"\n\n<<<B) The receptionist is standing in front of the door>>>"
