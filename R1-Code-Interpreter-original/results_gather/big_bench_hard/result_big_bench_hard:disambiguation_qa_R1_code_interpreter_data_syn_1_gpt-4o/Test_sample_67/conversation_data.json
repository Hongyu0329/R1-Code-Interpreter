    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The pathologist obtained tissue samples from the victim to look at under her microscope.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Possible Antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"her.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the pathologist\" and \"the victim.\"\n\n2. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence describes an action performed by the pathologist: obtaining tissue samples to examine them under a microscope.\n   - Typically, in a professional setting, a pathologist would use their own equipment, such as a microscope, to examine samples. It is less likely that the pathologist would use the victim's microscope, especially since the victim is not described as having any professional connection to the use of a microscope.\n\n3. **Grammatical and Logical Considerations**:\n   - The pronoun \"her\" is more likely to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is \"the pathologist,\" as it is common for pronouns to refer back to the subject when describing actions they perform.\n   - The logical flow of the sentence suggests that the pathologist is the one conducting the examination, thus using her own microscope.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable antecedent for \"her\" is \"the pathologist.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(A) It was the pathologist's microscope\n\n<<<A>>>"
