    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The developer argued with the designer because she liked the design,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The developer argued with the designer\" and \"because she liked the design.\" The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the developer\" or \"the designer.\" In English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun of the appropriate gender. However, both \"the developer\" and \"the designer\" are potential antecedents for \"she\" because both can be female.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: Without additional context, it is difficult to definitively determine whether \"she\" refers to \"the developer\" or \"the designer.\" The sentence does not provide any specific clues or context that would clarify which person liked the design.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Since both \"the developer\" and \"the designer\" are equally plausible antecedents for \"she,\" and there is no additional context to clarify the reference, the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
