    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts:\n   - \"The driver yelled at the tailor\"\n   - \"after he broke a window\"\n\n2. **Pronoun \"he\"**: The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the driver\" or \"the tailor.\" The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to definitively determine which individual \"he\" refers to.\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: In English, when a pronoun is used, it typically refers to the most recently mentioned noun of the same gender. However, in this sentence, both \"the driver\" and \"the tailor\" are mentioned before the pronoun \"he,\" and both are male. Therefore, the pronoun \"he\" could logically refer to either \"the driver\" or \"the tailor.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether \"he\" refers to \"the driver\" or \"the tailor.\" Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
