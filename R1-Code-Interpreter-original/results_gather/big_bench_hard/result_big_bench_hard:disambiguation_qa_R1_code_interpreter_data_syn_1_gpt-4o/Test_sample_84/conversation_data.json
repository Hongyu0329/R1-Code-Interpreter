    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because he was in a good mood,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two parts: \"The mechanic greets the receptionist\" and \"because he was in a good mood.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recent noun of the same gender. In this case, \"he\" is a masculine pronoun, and the two potential antecedents are \"the mechanic\" and \"the receptionist.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence provides a causal relationship: the greeting occurs because \"he was in a good mood.\" This suggests that the person in a good mood is the one initiating the action (greeting).\n\n4. **Logical Inference**: It is more logical to assume that the person who is in a good mood is the one performing the action of greeting. Therefore, \"he\" is more likely to refer to \"the mechanic,\" as he is the one greeting the receptionist.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"he\" refers to \"the mechanic.\"\n\n<<<A>>>"
