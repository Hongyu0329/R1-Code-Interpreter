    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The mechanic disliked the cashier because they are arrogant,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The mechanic disliked the cashier\" and \"because they are arrogant.\" The pronoun \"they\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"they\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun. In this context, it is used as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence provides a reason for the mechanic's dislike of the cashier, which is \"because they are arrogant.\" This suggests that the arrogance is a characteristic of the person being disliked, which is the cashier.\n\n4. **Logical Inference**: Since the sentence is explaining why the mechanic dislikes the cashier, it is logical to infer that the arrogance is attributed to the cashier, not the mechanic. The sentence implies that the mechanic's dislike is due to the cashier's arrogance.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that the pronoun \"they\" refers to the cashier.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) The cashier is arrogant\n\n<<<B>>>"
