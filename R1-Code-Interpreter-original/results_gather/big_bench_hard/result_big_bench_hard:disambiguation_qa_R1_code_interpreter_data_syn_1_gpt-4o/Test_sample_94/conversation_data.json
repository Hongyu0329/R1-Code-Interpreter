    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence \"The construction worker called the editor and told him the whole story,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence has two main actions: \"called\" and \"told.\"\n   - The subject of both actions is \"The construction worker.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun \"him\"**:\n   - The pronoun \"him\" is used in the second action \"told him the whole story.\"\n   - The pronoun \"him\" is a singular masculine pronoun, which could refer to either \"the construction worker\" or \"the editor.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The construction worker is the subject performing both actions.\n   - The editor is the object of the first action \"called.\"\n   - In typical English usage, when a pronoun follows a sequence of actions performed by the same subject, it often refers to the object of the previous action unless otherwise specified.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the structure and typical usage, \"him\" most likely refers to \"the editor,\" as the construction worker is the one performing the action of telling, and the editor is the one being told the story.\n\nTherefore, the most logical antecedent for \"him\" in this context is \"the editor.\"\n\n<<<answer B>>>"
