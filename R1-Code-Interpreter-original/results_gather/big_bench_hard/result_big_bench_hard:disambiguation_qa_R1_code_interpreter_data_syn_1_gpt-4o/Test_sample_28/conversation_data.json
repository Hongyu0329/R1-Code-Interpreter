    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because he needed a lab assistant,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist\" and \"because he needed a lab assistant.\"\n   - The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**:\n   - The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the undergraduate\" or \"the scientist.\"\n   - Typically, pronouns refer to the most recent noun of the same gender, but this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence provides a reason for the undergraduate's action: \"because he needed a lab assistant.\"\n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the undergraduate,\" it implies that the undergraduate is seeking a lab assistant, which is less likely since the undergraduate is applying for a position.\n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the scientist,\" it implies that the scientist needs a lab assistant, which aligns with the context of the undergraduate applying to work with the scientist.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the context and typical sentence structure, it is more logical that \"he\" refers to \"the scientist,\" as the scientist needing a lab assistant provides a reason for the undergraduate to apply for the position.\n\nTherefore, the most likely antecedent of \"he\" is \"the scientist.\"\n\n<<<(B) The scientist needed an assistant>>>"
