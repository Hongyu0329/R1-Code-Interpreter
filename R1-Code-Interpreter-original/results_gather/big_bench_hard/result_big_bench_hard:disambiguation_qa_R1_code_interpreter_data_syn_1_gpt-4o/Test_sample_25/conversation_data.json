    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is composed of two main parts: \"The technician told the customer\" and \"that she had completed the repair.\"\n   - The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**:\n   - The pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the technician\" or \"the customer\" since both are female nouns.\n   - There is no additional context provided in the sentence to clarify who \"she\" refers to.\n\n3. **Ambiguity**:\n   - Without additional context or information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"she\" refers to \"the technician\" or \"the customer.\"\n   - Therefore, the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
