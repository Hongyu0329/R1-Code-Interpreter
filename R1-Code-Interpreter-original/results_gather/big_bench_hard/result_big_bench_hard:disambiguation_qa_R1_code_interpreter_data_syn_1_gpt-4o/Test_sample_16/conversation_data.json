    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because he focuses on code.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured as a cause-and-effect statement: \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because he focuses on code.\"\n   - The pronoun \"he\" is used in the clause \"because he focuses on code,\" which provides the reason for the communication issue.\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - In the context of software development, it is more common for a developer to focus on code than a writer. This suggests that \"he\" is more likely to refer to \"the developer.\"\n   - However, without additional context, it is not explicitly clear whether \"he\" refers to \"the developer\" or \"the writer.\" Both could potentially focus on code, depending on their roles and responsibilities.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the lack of explicit context and the potential for both individuals to focus on code, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
