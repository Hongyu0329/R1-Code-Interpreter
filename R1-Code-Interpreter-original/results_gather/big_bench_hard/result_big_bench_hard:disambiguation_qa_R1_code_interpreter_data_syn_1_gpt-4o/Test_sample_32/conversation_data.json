    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The visitor told the teacher that he liked the cake,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"The visitor told the teacher\" is the main clause.\n   - \"that he liked the cake\" is a subordinate clause.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"he\"**: \n   - The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the visitor\" or \"the teacher\" since both are male entities mentioned in the sentence.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**:\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear who \"he\" refers to. Both the visitor and the teacher are possible antecedents for \"he.\"\n\n4. **Ambiguity**:\n   - Since the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to the visitor or the teacher, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
