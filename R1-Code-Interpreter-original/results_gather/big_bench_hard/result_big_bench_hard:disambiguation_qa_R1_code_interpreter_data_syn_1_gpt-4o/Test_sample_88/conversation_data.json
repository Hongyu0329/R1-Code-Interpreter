    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence \"The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave him some tips,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"The chief\" is the subject of the sentence.\n   - \"Thanked the housekeeper\" is the first action performed by the chief.\n   - \"Gave him some tips\" is the second action performed by the chief.\n\n2. **Pronoun Analysis**:\n   - The pronoun \"him\" is used in the context of the chief giving tips.\n   - In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned noun that matches in gender and number, unless context dictates otherwise.\n\n3. **Gender Consideration**:\n   - \"Him\" is a masculine pronoun. \n   - The sentence mentions two individuals: \"the chief\" and \"the housekeeper.\"\n   - Without additional context, we assume both could be male, but the pronoun \"him\" is more likely to refer to the housekeeper because he is the most recent male noun mentioned before the pronoun.\n\n4. **Contextual Clarity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context to suggest that \"him\" refers to the chief.\n   - Therefore, the default assumption is that \"him\" refers to the housekeeper.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"him\" is the housekeeper. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B) Gave the housekeeper some tips\n\n<<<B>>>"
