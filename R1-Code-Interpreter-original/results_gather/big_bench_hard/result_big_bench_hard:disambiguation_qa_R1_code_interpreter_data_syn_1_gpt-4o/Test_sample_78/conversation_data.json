    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because they asked,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The librarian helped the CEO to find the book\" and \"because they asked.\"\n   - The pronoun \"they\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**:\n   - \"They\" is a plural pronoun, which typically refers to a group of people or is used as a singular pronoun for gender neutrality.\n   - In this context, \"they\" could refer to either \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO,\" depending on the intended meaning.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - If \"they\" is used as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun, it could refer to either \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO.\"\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear who \"they\" refers to, as both the librarian and the CEO could have asked for help.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether \"they\" refers to \"the librarian\" or \"the CEO.\"\n   - Therefore, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
