    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The scientist collaborated with the artist\" and \"he shared a story.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the scientist\" or \"the artist.\" In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned noun of the appropriate gender, but this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: Without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the scientist\" or \"the artist.\" Both are male-gendered nouns, and the sentence does not provide any additional information to clarify which one shared the story.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Since there is no clear indication or context provided in the sentence to determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the scientist\" or \"the artist,\" the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
