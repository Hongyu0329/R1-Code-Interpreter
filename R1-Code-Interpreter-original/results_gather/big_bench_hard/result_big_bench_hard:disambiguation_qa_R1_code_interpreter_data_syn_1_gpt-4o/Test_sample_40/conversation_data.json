    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The assistant asked the physician if they could borrow some money,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"The assistant\" is the subject who is performing the action of asking.\n   - \"The physician\" is the object of the action, the one being asked.\n   - \"They\" is the pronoun whose antecedent we need to identify.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"They\"**:\n   - \"They\" is a plural pronoun, but it is often used as a singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or to maintain gender neutrality.\n   - In this context, \"they\" could refer to either \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to definitively determine whether \"they\" refers to \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n   - Without further context, both interpretations are plausible:\n     - (A) The assistant is asking if they (the assistant) could borrow money.\n     - (B) The assistant is asking if they (the physician) could borrow money.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the sentence lacks sufficient context to clearly identify the antecedent of \"they,\" it is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
