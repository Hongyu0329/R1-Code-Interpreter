    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence \"The designer showed the cook a blueprint and asked him for feedback,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"The designer showed the cook a blueprint\" - This part of the sentence establishes two individuals: the designer and the cook.\n   - \"and asked him for feedback\" - The pronoun \"him\" is used here, and we need to determine whether it refers to the designer or the cook.\n\n2. **Logical Analysis**:\n   - Typically, when someone shows another person something and then asks for feedback, the feedback is usually requested from the person who was shown the item. In this case, the cook is the one who was shown the blueprint.\n   - Therefore, it is logical to assume that the designer is asking the cook for feedback on the blueprint.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the typical flow of actions and the context provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the pronoun \"him\" refers to the cook.\n\nThus, the correct option is (B) Asked the cook.\n\n<<<answer B>>>"
