    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The reporter and the chef will discuss her favorite dishes,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Pronoun Analysis**: The pronoun \"her\" is a singular feminine pronoun. It refers to a female individual whose favorite dishes are being discussed.\n\n2. **Subject Analysis**: The sentence has two subjects: \"the reporter\" and \"the chef.\" Both are potential antecedents for the pronoun \"her.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: The sentence does not provide any additional context or clues to specify whether \"her\" refers to the reporter or the chef. In English, when a pronoun is used, it typically refers to the most recently mentioned noun of the appropriate gender, but this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Since both \"the reporter\" and \"the chef\" are equally valid antecedents for \"her\" and there is no additional context to clarify which one is intended, the pronoun \"her\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
