    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context in which the pronoun is used.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence has two main parts: \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer\" and \"gave them a prototype.\"\n   - The subject of the sentence is \"The carpenter,\" and the action is \"collaborated with the designer.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun \"them\"**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is used to refer to a person or people previously mentioned in the sentence.\n   - In this sentence, the two people mentioned are \"the carpenter\" and \"the designer.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular non-binary person. However, in this context, it is more likely referring to a singular person because only two individuals are mentioned.\n   - Since \"the carpenter\" is the subject performing the action, it is more likely that \"them\" refers to \"the designer,\" who is the other person involved in the collaboration.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most logical antecedent for \"them\" in this context is \"the designer,\" as it makes sense for the carpenter to give the prototype to the person they collaborated with.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) Gave the designer a prototype.\n\n<<<B) Gave the designer a prototype>>>"
