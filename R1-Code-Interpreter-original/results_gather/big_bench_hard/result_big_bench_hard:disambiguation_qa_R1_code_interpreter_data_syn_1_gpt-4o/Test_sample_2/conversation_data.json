    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she used big words.\"\n\nIn this sentence, \"she\" is a pronoun that refers to a female subject. The sentence provides two possible female subjects: \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\" The pronoun \"she\" is used to explain why the developer was unable to communicate with the writer. The reason given is that \"she used big words.\"\n\nThe logical interpretation is that the writer is the one using big words, which made it difficult for the developer to communicate with her. This is because the sentence structure suggests that the action or characteristic (using big words) is attributed to the person who is causing the communication difficulty. Therefore, \"she\" most likely refers to \"the writer.\"\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(B) The writer uses big words\n\n<<<answer B>>>"
