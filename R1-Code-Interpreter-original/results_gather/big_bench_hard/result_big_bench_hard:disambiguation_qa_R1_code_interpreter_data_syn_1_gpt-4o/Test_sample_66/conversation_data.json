    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the developer\" and \"the writer.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured as a cause-and-effect statement: \"The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words.\"\n   - The use of \"because\" indicates that the reason for the developer's inability to communicate is related to the use of big words.\n\n3. **Determine the logical antecedent**:\n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the developer,\" it would mean the developer uses big words, which is why they cannot communicate with the writer. This interpretation is less logical because it suggests the developer's own use of big words is the barrier to communication.\n   - If \"they\" refers to \"the writer,\" it would mean the writer uses big words, which is why the developer cannot communicate with them. This interpretation is more logical because it suggests the writer's use of big words is the barrier to communication.\n\n4. **Consider ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide explicit clarification on who \"they\" refers to, but the logical interpretation leans towards \"the writer\" as the antecedent.\n   - However, without additional context, the sentence could technically be interpreted either way, making it ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical interpretation is that \"they\" refers to \"the writer,\" but the sentence structure allows for ambiguity.\n\n<<<(B) The writer uses big words>>>"
