    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"The supervisor gave the employee feedback on his stellar performance,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"The supervisor\" is the subject who is performing the action of giving feedback.\n   - \"The employee\" is the object receiving the feedback.\n   - \"His stellar performance\" is the object of the feedback.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"his\"**: \n   - The pronoun \"his\" is a possessive pronoun that refers to a male individual previously mentioned in the sentence.\n   - In this sentence, there are two male individuals: \"the supervisor\" and \"the employee.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Typically, feedback is given to someone about their own performance. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that the feedback is about the employee's performance rather than the supervisor's.\n   - The sentence structure and common usage suggest that \"his\" refers to the person who is the subject of the feedback, which is the employee.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely antecedent for \"his\" is \"the employee.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) It was the employee's performance\n\n<<<answer B>>>"
