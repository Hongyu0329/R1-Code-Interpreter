    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"The educator was meeting with a student to discuss their grading policy,\" we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\n1. **Pronoun Analysis**: The pronoun \"their\" is a possessive pronoun that can refer to a singular or plural noun. In this context, it is used to refer to a singular noun because the sentence involves two individuals: the educator and the student.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence involves a meeting between an educator and a student. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss a grading policy. Typically, in an educational context, a grading policy is more likely to be associated with the educator or the institution rather than the student. \n\n3. **Logical Inference**: Given that educators are usually responsible for setting and explaining grading policies, it is logical to infer that \"their grading policy\" refers to the educator's grading policy. \n\n4. **Ambiguity Check**: There is no explicit indication in the sentence that the student has a grading policy. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the grading policy belongs to the educator.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely antecedent of \"their\" is the educator. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(A) It was the educator's grading policy\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
