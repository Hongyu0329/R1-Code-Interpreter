    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to their office,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Pronoun Identification**: The pronoun in question is \"their.\"\n\n2. **Potential Antecedents**: The potential antecedents for \"their\" are:\n   - \"Sam\"\n   - \"the producers\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - \"Their\" is a plural possessive pronoun. It is used to refer to something belonging to more than one person.\n   - \"Sam\" is a singular noun, so \"their\" cannot refer to \"Sam.\"\n   - \"The producers\" is a plural noun, which matches the plural possessive pronoun \"their.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, \"their\" refers to \"the producers.\" Therefore, the office belongs to the producers.\n\nThe correct option is (B) It is the producers' office.\n\n<<<B>>>"
