    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"The reporter and the chef discussed his favorite dishes,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence has two subjects: \"the reporter\" and \"the chef.\" The pronoun \"his\" is a possessive pronoun that refers to a singular male antecedent. However, both \"the reporter\" and \"the chef\" are singular male nouns, so \"his\" could grammatically refer to either one.\n\n2. **Context**: Without additional context, there is no clear indication of which person's favorite dishes are being discussed. The sentence does not provide any clues or additional information that would help us determine whether \"his\" refers to the reporter or the chef.\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: Since both \"the reporter\" and \"the chef\" are equally plausible antecedents for \"his,\" and there is no contextual information to clarify the reference, the pronoun \"his\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
