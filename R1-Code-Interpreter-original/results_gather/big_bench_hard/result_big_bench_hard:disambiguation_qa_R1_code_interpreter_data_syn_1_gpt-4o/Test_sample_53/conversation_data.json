    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The sheriff protected the writer because they uphold the peace,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the subjects involved.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"The sheriff protected the writer\" is the main clause.\n   - \"because they uphold the peace\" is a subordinate clause providing the reason for the action in the main clause.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"they\"**: \n   - \"They\" is a plural pronoun, but in this context, it is used in a singular sense to refer to a person whose gender is unspecified or non-binary.\n\n3. **Possible Antecedents**:\n   - The sheriff\n   - The writer\n\n4. **Logical Analysis**:\n   - The sentence suggests that the reason for the sheriff's action (protecting the writer) is because the person being referred to by \"they\" upholds the peace.\n   - Typically, a sheriff is associated with upholding peace, but the sentence structure allows for either the sheriff or the writer to be the one upholding peace.\n\n5. **Ambiguity**:\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"they\" refers to the sheriff or the writer. Both could logically uphold the peace, and the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively assign the pronoun to one or the other.\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
