    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The student set up a meeting with the architect to review her blueprints,\" we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\n1. **Pronoun Analysis**: The pronoun \"her\" is a possessive pronoun, which means it refers to something owned or associated with a female subject. In this sentence, there are two potential female subjects: \"the student\" and \"the architect.\"\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: \n   - The sentence structure suggests that the meeting is set up for the purpose of reviewing blueprints. \n   - Typically, an architect is more likely to have blueprints, as they are part of their professional work. However, it is also possible for a student, especially if they are studying architecture or a related field, to have blueprints.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Consideration**: \n   - Without additional context, it is not clear whether the blueprints belong to the student or the architect. \n   - The sentence does not provide any specific information that definitively links the blueprints to either the student or the architect.\n\nGiven these points, the antecedent of \"her\" is not explicitly clear from the sentence alone, making it ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
