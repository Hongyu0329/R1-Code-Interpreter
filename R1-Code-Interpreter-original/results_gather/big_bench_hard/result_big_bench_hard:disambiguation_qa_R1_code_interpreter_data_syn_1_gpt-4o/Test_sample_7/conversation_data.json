    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The guard called the cleaner and asked them to open the door,\" we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence is composed of two main actions: \"The guard called the cleaner\" and \"asked them to open the door.\" The pronoun \"them\" is used in the second action.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is unknown or non-binary. In this context, it is used to refer to a singular noun since there are only two people mentioned: \"the guard\" and \"the cleaner.\"\n\n3. **Logical Flow**: The logical flow of the sentence suggests that the person who is being asked to open the door is the one who was called. In this case, the guard called the cleaner, and it is logical to assume that the cleaner is the one being asked to open the door.\n\n4. **Ambiguity Check**: There is no explicit indication in the sentence that the guard is asking themselves to open the door. The sentence structure and typical usage suggest that the cleaner is the one being asked.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"them\" is \"the cleaner.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) Asked the cleaner\n\n<<<answer B>>>"
