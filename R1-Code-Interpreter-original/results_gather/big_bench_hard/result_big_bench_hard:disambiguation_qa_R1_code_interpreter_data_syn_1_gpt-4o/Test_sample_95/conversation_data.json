    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The developer met with the secretary because they made a mistake,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts:\n   - \"The developer met with the secretary\"\n   - \"because they made a mistake\"\n\n2. **Pronoun \"they\"**: The pronoun \"they\" is used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is unknown or non-binary. In this sentence, \"they\" could refer to either \"the developer\" or \"the secretary,\" but not both simultaneously, as both are singular nouns.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: The sentence does not provide additional context to clarify who made the mistake. Both \"the developer\" and \"the secretary\" are equally plausible antecedents for \"they.\"\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Without further context or additional information, it is impossible to definitively determine whether \"the developer\" or \"the secretary\" made the mistake. Therefore, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
