    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n\"The worker told the pedestrian that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the worker\" and \"the pedestrian.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure:**\n   - The sentence is structured as a reporting clause: \"The worker told the pedestrian that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible.\"\n   - The pronoun \"they\" is used in the reported speech part of the sentence.\n\n3. **Consider the Context:**\n   - Typically, in English, when a singular noun (like \"the worker\" or \"the pedestrian\") is used, the pronoun that refers back to it is also singular (he/she/it). However, \"they\" is often used as a singular pronoun in modern English to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or to refer to a group of people.\n   - In this context, \"they\" could refer to a group of workers, which would make \"the worker\" the more likely antecedent, as it is common for a worker to represent a group or team.\n\n4. **Determine Ambiguity:**\n   - If the sentence does not provide enough information to clearly determine whether \"they\" refers to \"the worker\" or \"the pedestrian,\" it would be considered ambiguous.\n   - However, given the context of the sentence, it is more logical to assume that \"they\" refers to \"the worker\" or the group the worker represents, as it is more likely that workers are repairing the sidewalk rather than a pedestrian.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable antecedent for \"they\" is \"the worker,\" assuming the worker is part of a team or group responsible for the repair.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(A) The worker was repairing\n\n<<<A>>>"
