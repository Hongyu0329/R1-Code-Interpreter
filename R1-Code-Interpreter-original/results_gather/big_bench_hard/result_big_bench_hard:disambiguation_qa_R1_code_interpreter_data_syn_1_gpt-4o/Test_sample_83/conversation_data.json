    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context. The sentence is: \"The worker told the pedestrian that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.\"\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The main clause is \"The worker told the pedestrian.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun \"he\"**: \n   - The pronoun \"he\" is in the subordinate clause and refers to a male individual.\n   - In the main clause, we have two male entities: \"The worker\" and \"the pedestrian.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context to clarify who \"he\" refers to.\n   - Both \"the worker\" and \"the pedestrian\" are possible antecedents for \"he.\"\n\n4. **Ambiguity**:\n   - Without additional context or information, it is unclear whether \"he\" refers to \"the worker\" or \"the pedestrian.\"\n   - Therefore, the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
