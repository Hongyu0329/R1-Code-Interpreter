    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the carpenter\" and \"the onlooker.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure:**\n   - The sentence structure is: \"[Subject] told [Object] that [Pronoun] had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n   - Here, \"The carpenter\" is the subject, and \"the onlooker\" is the object.\n\n3. **Consider the Context:**\n   - Typically, when a subject tells an object something, the information is often about the subject unless specified otherwise.\n   - The use of \"they\" as a pronoun can refer to a singular person in a gender-neutral way or to multiple people. However, in this context, it is more likely to refer to the subject, \"the carpenter,\" unless there is additional context indicating that \"the onlooker\" was involved in the work.\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent:**\n   - Without additional context, the most straightforward interpretation is that \"they\" refers to \"the carpenter,\" as it is more common for the subject of the sentence to be the one performing the action described in the subordinate clause.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the most likely antecedent of \"they\" is \"the carpenter.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The carpenter had been working on the house.\n\n<<<A>>>"
