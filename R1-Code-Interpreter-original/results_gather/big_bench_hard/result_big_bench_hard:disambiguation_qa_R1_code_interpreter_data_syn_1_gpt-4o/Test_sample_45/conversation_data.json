    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"Alex tells us that they could not meet,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"Alex tells us\" is the main clause.\n   - \"that they could not meet\" is a subordinate clause.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"they\"**: \n   - The pronoun \"they\" is used in the subordinate clause \"that they could not meet.\"\n   - \"They\" is typically a plural pronoun or a singular pronoun for non-binary individuals.\n\n3. **Possible Antecedents**:\n   - \"Alex\" is a singular noun, typically referring to one person, unless Alex is a non-binary individual who uses \"they/them\" pronouns.\n   - \"us\" is a plural pronoun, referring to the speaker and at least one other person.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Without additional context, \"they\" could refer to either \"Alex\" if Alex uses \"they/them\" pronouns, or it could refer to \"us\" if the speaker is indicating that the group including the speaker could not meet.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without further context, it is not clear whether \"they\" refers to \"Alex\" or \"us.\" Therefore, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
