    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Possible Antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**:\n   - The main clause is \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier.\"\n   - The subordinate clause is \"because he needed to understand the case.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Logical Subject**:\n   - The action of \"looking into illegal accusations\" is performed by \"the lawyer.\"\n   - The reason provided is \"because he needed to understand the case.\"\n\n4. **Logical Reasoning**:\n   - It is more logical that the person who is looking into the accusations (the lawyer) would need to understand the case. This is because understanding the case is typically part of a lawyer's responsibilities when investigating accusations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the context and typical roles, \"he\" most likely refers to \"the lawyer.\"\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is \"the lawyer.\"\n\n<<<(A) The lawyer needed to understand>>>"
