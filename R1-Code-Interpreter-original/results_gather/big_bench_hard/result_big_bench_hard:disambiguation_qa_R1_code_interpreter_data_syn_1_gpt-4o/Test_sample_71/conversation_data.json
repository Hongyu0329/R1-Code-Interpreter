    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The developer met with the secretary because she made a mistake,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The developer met with the secretary\" and \"because she made a mistake.\" The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"she\" typically refers to a female subject mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this case, the two potential female subjects are \"the developer\" and \"the secretary.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence provides a causal relationship indicated by \"because.\" This suggests that the meeting occurred due to a mistake made by one of the individuals. Without additional context, it is unclear which individual made the mistake.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Since both \"the developer\" and \"the secretary\" are potential antecedents for \"she,\" and there is no additional context to clarify which one made the mistake, the pronoun reference is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(C) Ambiguous\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
