    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave her some tips,\" we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence.\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"her.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the chief\" and \"the housekeeper.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured as \"The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave her some tips.\"\n   - The subject of the sentence is \"The chief.\"\n   - The direct object of the verb \"thanked\" is \"the housekeeper.\"\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - The pronoun \"her\" is used in the context of \"gave her some tips.\"\n   - In English, it is common for pronouns to refer to the most recently mentioned noun that matches in gender and number.\n   - Since \"her\" is a feminine pronoun, it is more likely to refer to \"the housekeeper,\" who is the most recently mentioned female noun.\n\n4. **Consider the logical context**:\n   - It is logical for the chief to give tips to the housekeeper after thanking her, as this is a common social interaction where someone in a position of authority or gratitude gives a tip to someone who has provided a service.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical and grammatically consistent antecedent for \"her\" is \"the housekeeper.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) Gave the housekeeper some tips.\n\n<<<B) Gave the housekeeper some tips>>>"
