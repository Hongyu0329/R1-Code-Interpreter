    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The assistant asked the physician if he needs any help,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence has two main components: \"The assistant asked the physician\" and \"if he needs any help.\"\n   - The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**:\n   - The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n   - Typically, in English, pronouns refer to the most recently mentioned noun, which in this case is \"the physician.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**:\n   - Without additional context, it is not explicitly clear whether \"he\" refers to \"the assistant\" or \"the physician.\"\n   - The sentence does not provide enough information to definitively determine the antecedent of \"he.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the lack of explicit context and the potential for either interpretation, the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
