    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"The customer and the chef discuss his culinary training,\" we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the customer\" and \"the chef.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the context**:\n   - The sentence involves a discussion between two people: the customer and the chef.\n   - The subject of the discussion is \"culinary training.\"\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - In the context of a discussion about \"culinary training,\" it is more logical to assume that the chef, who is professionally involved in culinary arts, would be the one with culinary training. Therefore, \"his culinary training\" is more likely to refer to the chef's training.\n\n4. **Consider ambiguity**:\n   - While it is possible for a customer to have culinary training, the context of the sentence suggests that the chef is the more likely candidate for having culinary training. Thus, the sentence is not ambiguous in this context.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"his\" is \"the chef.\"\n\n<<<(B) It is the chef's culinary training>>>"
