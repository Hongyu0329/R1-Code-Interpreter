    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support.\"\n\n1. The sentence mentions \"the writer\" and \"their friends' support.\" The pronoun \"their\" is used to indicate possession or association with \"friends.\"\n\n2. The structure \"the writer and their friends\" suggests that \"their\" is referring to the writer. This is because \"their\" is used to show possession of \"friends,\" and it is common in English to use \"their\" as a singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is not specified.\n\n3. The options provided are:\n   (A) They were the writer's friends\n   (B) They were the friends' friends\n   (C) They were the story's friends\n   (D) Ambiguous\n\n4. Based on the analysis, \"their\" is most logically referring to the writer, making the friends \"the writer's friends.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) They were the writer's friends.\n\n<<<A>>>"
