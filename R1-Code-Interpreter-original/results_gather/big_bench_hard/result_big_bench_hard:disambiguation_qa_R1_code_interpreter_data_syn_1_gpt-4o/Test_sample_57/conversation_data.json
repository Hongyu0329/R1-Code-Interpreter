    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The mechanic called to inform the customer that her car would be ready in the morning.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"her.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the mechanic\" and \"the customer.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the context**:\n   - The sentence structure suggests that the mechanic is providing information to the customer. \n   - The information is about a car being ready, which implies that the car is likely associated with the person receiving the information, i.e., the customer.\n\n3. **Determine the most logical antecedent**:\n   - In typical scenarios, a mechanic would inform a customer about the status of the customer's car, not the mechanic's own car.\n   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"her car\" refers to the customer's car.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"her\" is the customer. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<(B) It was the customer's car>>>"
