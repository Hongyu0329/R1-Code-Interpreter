    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor,\" we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence.\n\n1. The sentence is structured as a complex sentence with a dependent clause (\"Before he sent the letter\") and an independent clause (\"Alex did not know Taylor\").\n2. The pronoun \"he\" is used in the dependent clause, and we need to determine who \"he\" refers to.\n3. In English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this sentence, the nearest preceding noun is \"Alex.\"\n4. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"he\" refers to \"Alex,\" as there is no other male noun mentioned before the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct option is:\n(A) Alex sent the letter\n\nThus, the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is \"Alex.\"\n\n<<<A>>>"
