    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"The reporter and the chef will discuss their favorite dishes,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence has two subjects, \"the reporter\" and \"the chef,\" connected by the conjunction \"and.\" The pronoun \"their\" is a possessive pronoun that refers to something owned or associated with the subjects.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"their\" is used to indicate possession by more than one person. In this sentence, \"their\" refers to both \"the reporter\" and \"the chef\" collectively. It implies that the favorite dishes belong to both of them.\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - Option (A) suggests that the discussion is about the reporter's favorite dishes only. This is incorrect because \"their\" refers to both individuals.\n   - Option (B) suggests that the discussion is about the chef's favorite dishes only. This is also incorrect for the same reason as above.\n   - Option (C) suggests that it is ambiguous. However, in this context, \"their\" clearly refers to both the reporter and the chef, making it not ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct interpretation is that \"their\" refers to both the reporter and the chef, and they will discuss the favorite dishes of both individuals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options, but the closest understanding is that \"their\" refers to both individuals collectively.\n\n<<<answer Ambiguous>>>"
