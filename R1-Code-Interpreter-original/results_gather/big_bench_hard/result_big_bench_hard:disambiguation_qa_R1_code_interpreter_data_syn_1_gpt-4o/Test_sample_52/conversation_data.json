    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The carpenter told the onlooker that he had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n\n1. **Subject and Object Identification**: \n   - The subject of the main clause is \"The carpenter.\"\n   - The object of the main clause is \"the onlooker.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun \"he\" Analysis**:\n   - The pronoun \"he\" appears in the subordinate clause \"that he had been working on the house for three weeks.\"\n   - The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"The carpenter\" or \"the onlooker.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**:\n   - Typically, in English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause following a main clause, it often refers to the subject of the main clause unless context suggests otherwise.\n   - In this sentence, there is no additional context provided that would suggest the onlooker was working on the house. The default assumption would be that the carpenter, who is the subject of the main clause, is the one who had been working on the house.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the typical structure and lack of additional context, the most likely antecedent for \"he\" is \"The carpenter.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The carpenter had been working on the house.\n\n<<<A>>>"
