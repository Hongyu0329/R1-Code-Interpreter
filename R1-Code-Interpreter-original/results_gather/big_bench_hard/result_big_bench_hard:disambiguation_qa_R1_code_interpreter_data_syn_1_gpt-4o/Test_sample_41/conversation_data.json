    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The cleaner called the guard and asked them to open the door,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - \"The cleaner called the guard\" is the first part of the sentence. Here, \"the cleaner\" is the subject, and \"the guard\" is the object of the verb \"called.\"\n   - \"and asked them to open the door\" is the second part of the sentence. The pronoun \"them\" is used here.\n\n2. **Pronoun Analysis**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular noun when gender is unknown or non-binary. However, in this context, it is used to refer to a singular noun, either \"the cleaner\" or \"the guard.\"\n\n3. **Logical Interpretation**:\n   - The cleaner is the one initiating the call, and it is logical to assume that the cleaner is asking the guard to open the door. This is because guards are typically responsible for security and access control, which includes opening doors.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the logical roles and typical responsibilities, it is more likely that \"them\" refers to \"the guard.\"\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the cleaner asked the guard to open the door.\n\n<<<B>>>"
