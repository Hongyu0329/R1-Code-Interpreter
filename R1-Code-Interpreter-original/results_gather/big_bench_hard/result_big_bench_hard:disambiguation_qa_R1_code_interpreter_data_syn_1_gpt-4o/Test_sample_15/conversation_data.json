    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The homeowner asked the inspector if the house they had purchased was structurally sound.\"\n\n- The sentence involves two parties: \"the homeowner\" and \"the inspector.\"\n- The pronoun \"they\" is used to refer to a group or an individual in a gender-neutral way.\n- The context of the sentence suggests that the homeowner is inquiring about the structural soundness of a house. It is more logical to assume that the homeowner is concerned about a house they own or are responsible for, rather than a house the inspector owns.\n- Therefore, it is more likely that \"they\" refers to \"the homeowner.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the homeowner.\"\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n(A) The homeowner had purchased\n\n<<<A>>>"
