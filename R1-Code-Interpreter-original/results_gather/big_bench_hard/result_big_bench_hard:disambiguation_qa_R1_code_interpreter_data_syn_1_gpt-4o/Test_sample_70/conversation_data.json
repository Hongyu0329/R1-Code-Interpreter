    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The scientist collaborates with the artist, and she shares a story,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The scientist collaborates with the artist\" and \"she shares a story.\" The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are singular and could potentially match the pronoun \"she.\"\n\n3. **Gender Consideration**: The pronoun \"she\" is typically used to refer to a female. Without additional context, both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" could be female, making it unclear which one \"she\" refers to.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Since there is no additional context or information provided in the sentence to clarify whether \"the scientist\" or \"the artist\" is female, the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous. It could refer to either \"the scientist\" or \"the artist.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
