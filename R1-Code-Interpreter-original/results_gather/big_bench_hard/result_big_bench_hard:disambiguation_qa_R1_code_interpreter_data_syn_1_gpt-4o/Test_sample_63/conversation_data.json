    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The patient was referred to the specialist because she is an expert on rare skin conditions.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the patient\" and \"the specialist.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured such that \"The patient was referred to the specialist\" is the main clause, and \"because she is an expert on rare skin conditions\" is a subordinate clause providing a reason for the referral.\n\n3. **Determine the logical antecedent**:\n   - The subordinate clause \"because she is an expert on rare skin conditions\" provides the reason for the referral. \n   - Logically, the reason for referring a patient to a specialist would be because the specialist has expertise in a particular area, in this case, rare skin conditions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pronoun \"she\" logically refers to \"the specialist\" because it makes sense that the patient was referred to the specialist due to the specialist's expertise.\n\nTherefore, the correct antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" is \"the specialist.\"\n\n<<<(B) The specialist is an expert>>>"
