    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the roles of the characters involved.\n\n1. **Characters and Actions**:\n   - The janitor: Warned the child and is responsible for mopping.\n   - The child: Was warned not to step on the wet floor.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"she\"**:\n   - The pronoun \"she\" is used to refer to a female character in the sentence.\n   - The sentence structure suggests that \"she\" is the one who would have to mop the floor again if the child steps on it.\n\n3. **Logical Analysis**:\n   - The janitor is the one who mops the floor, as indicated by the context of the sentence. It is logical to assume that if the floor is stepped on, the janitor would be the one to mop it again.\n   - The child is the one being warned, and there is no indication that the child would be responsible for mopping.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pronoun \"she\" most logically refers to the janitor, as she is the one who would have to redo the mopping if the child steps on the wet floor.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable antecedent for \"she\" is the janitor.\n\n<<<(A) The janitor would have to mop>>>"
