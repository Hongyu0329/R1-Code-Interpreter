    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Alex tells us that he could not meet,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"Alex tells us that he could not meet.\"\n   - \"Alex\" is the subject of the main clause \"Alex tells us.\"\n   - \"He could not meet\" is a subordinate clause introduced by \"that.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**:\n   - The pronoun \"he\" is typically used to refer to a male individual.\n   - In the sentence, the only explicitly mentioned male individual is \"Alex.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - Since \"Alex\" is the only male individual mentioned, it is logical to assume that \"he\" refers to \"Alex.\"\n   - There is no indication in the sentence that \"we\" includes a male individual who could be the antecedent of \"he.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the sentence structure and the lack of additional context, the most straightforward interpretation is that \"he\" refers to \"Alex.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) Alex could not meet.\n\n<<<answer A>>>"
