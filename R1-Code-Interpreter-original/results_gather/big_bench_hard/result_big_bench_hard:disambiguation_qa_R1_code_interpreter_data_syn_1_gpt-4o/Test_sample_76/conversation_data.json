    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because she needed to understand the case.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Possible Antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the lawyer\" and \"the cashier.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured such that the main clause is \"The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier,\" and the subordinate clause is \"because she needed to understand the case.\"\n   - The subordinate clause provides a reason for the action in the main clause.\n\n3. **Determine the Logical Antecedent**:\n   - The action of \"looking into illegal accusations\" is performed by \"the lawyer.\" \n   - The reason provided is \"because she needed to understand the case.\" \n   - It is logical to assume that the person who is looking into the accusations (the lawyer) is the one who needs to understand the case, as it is part of their professional duty to do so.\n\n4. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - While it is possible for the cashier to also need to understand the case, the sentence structure and typical roles suggest that the lawyer is the more likely antecedent.\n   - However, without additional context, it is not entirely impossible for \"she\" to refer to the cashier, making it potentially ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent is \"the lawyer,\" but there is a slight possibility of ambiguity. However, given the context and typical roles, the more likely interpretation is that \"she\" refers to \"the lawyer.\"\n\nTherefore, the best option is:\n(A) The lawyer needed to understand\n\n<<<answer A>>>"
