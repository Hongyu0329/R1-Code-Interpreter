    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"My parent called his secretary for more information,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Pronoun Identification**: The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n\n2. **Antecedent Analysis**: The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun to which the pronoun refers. In this sentence, \"his\" is a possessive pronoun that should refer to a singular male noun.\n\n3. **Noun Identification**: The nouns in the sentence are \"parent\" and \"secretary.\"\n\n4. **Gender and Number Agreement**: The pronoun \"his\" is typically used to refer to a singular male noun. The noun \"parent\" is singular and can be male, which aligns with the pronoun \"his.\" The noun \"secretary\" is the object of the verb \"called\" and does not fit as an antecedent for \"his.\"\n\n5. **Contextual Clarity**: The sentence does not provide additional context to suggest that \"his\" could refer to someone other than \"my parent.\" Therefore, the most logical antecedent for \"his\" is \"my parent.\"\n\n6. **Options Evaluation**:\n   - (A) They were my parent's secretary: This option suggests that \"his\" refers to \"my parent,\" which aligns with our analysis.\n   - (B) They were the secretary's secretary: This option suggests that \"his\" refers to \"the secretary,\" which does not align with the sentence structure or typical usage.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: This option suggests that the antecedent is unclear, but based on the analysis, \"his\" logically refers to \"my parent.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate option is (A).\n\n<<<(A) They were my parent's secretary>>>"
