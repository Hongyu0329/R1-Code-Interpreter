    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context. The sentence is: \"The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the nurse\" and \"the laborer.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured as \"The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful.\"\n   - The pronoun \"she\" is used in the context of explaining why the nurse was running from the laborer.\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - Typically, in English, a pronoun refers to the closest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, both \"the nurse\" and \"the laborer\" are singular and could potentially match \"she\" if we assume \"the laborer\" is female.\n   - However, the default assumption without additional context is that \"the nurse\" is female, and \"the laborer\" is male, making \"the nurse\" the more likely antecedent for \"she.\"\n\n4. **Consider the logic of the sentence**:\n   - The sentence suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: the nurse is running away because someone smells awful.\n   - It is more logical that the nurse is running away because the laborer smells awful, rather than the nurse running away because she herself smells awful.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on typical gender assumptions and the logical flow of the sentence, the pronoun \"she\" most likely refers to \"the laborer,\" assuming the laborer is female. However, without explicit gender information for the laborer, this could be ambiguous.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most logical choice is that the laborer smelled awful, but it could be considered ambiguous without additional context.\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n\n<<<answer (B) The laborer smelled awful>>>"
