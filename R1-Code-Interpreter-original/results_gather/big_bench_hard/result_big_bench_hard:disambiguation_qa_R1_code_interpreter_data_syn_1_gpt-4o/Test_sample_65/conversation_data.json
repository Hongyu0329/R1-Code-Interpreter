    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The scientist collaborated with the artist, and she shared a story,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The scientist collaborated with the artist\" and \"she shared a story.\" The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"she\" is typically used to refer to a female subject. In the sentence, there are two potential female subjects: \"the scientist\" and \"the artist.\"\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: Without additional context, it is unclear which of the two female subjects \"she\" refers to. Both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" could logically be the one who shared a story. The sentence does not provide any additional clues or context to definitively determine the antecedent of \"she.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the scientist\" or \"the artist,\" making it ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
