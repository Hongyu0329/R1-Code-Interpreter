    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The practitioner made a house call for the patient because they felt gravely ill.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the practitioner\" and \"the patient.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure and context**:\n   - The sentence states that the practitioner made a house call for the patient. \n   - The reason given for the house call is that \"they felt gravely ill.\"\n\n3. **Determine the logical antecedent**:\n   - Typically, a house call is made by a practitioner when the patient is ill, not when the practitioner is ill. \n   - Therefore, it is more logical to assume that \"they\" refers to \"the patient\" who felt gravely ill, prompting the practitioner to make the house call.\n\n4. **Consider ambiguity**:\n   - While grammatically, \"they\" could refer to either \"the practitioner\" or \"the patient,\" the context strongly suggests that it refers to \"the patient.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the patient.\"\n\n<<<answer B>>>"
