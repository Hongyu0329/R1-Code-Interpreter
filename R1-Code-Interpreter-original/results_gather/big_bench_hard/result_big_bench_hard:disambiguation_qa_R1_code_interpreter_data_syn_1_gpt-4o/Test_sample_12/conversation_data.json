    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told them a fake story.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"them.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the writer\" and \"the salesperson.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure:**\n   - The sentence consists of two main actions: \"tried to fool\" and \"told a fake story.\"\n   - The subject of both actions is \"the writer.\"\n\n3. **Determine the logical antecedent:**\n   - The action \"tried to fool\" suggests that the writer is attempting to deceive someone.\n   - The action \"told them a fake story\" follows the attempt to fool, indicating that the story is part of the deception.\n   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"them\" refers to the person being deceived, which is \"the salesperson.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The pronoun \"them\" refers to \"the salesperson\" because the writer is trying to deceive the salesperson by telling a fake story.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(B) Told the salesperson a fake story\n\n<<<B>>>"
