    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave them a discount,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence has two main actions: \"made a desk\" and \"gave a discount.\"\n   - The subject of both actions is \"The carpenter.\"\n   - The object of the first action \"made a desk for the clerk\" suggests that the desk is made for the clerk.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"them\"**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is used to refer to a person or people previously mentioned.\n   - In this sentence, the only other person mentioned is \"the clerk.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The carpenter is the one providing the service (making a desk), and it is common for service providers to offer discounts to their clients or customers.\n   - Therefore, it is logical to infer that \"them\" refers to the recipient of the service, which is \"the clerk.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the pronoun \"them\" most likely refers to \"the clerk,\" as it is common for the person receiving a service to be given a discount by the service provider.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) Gave the clerk a discount.\n\n<<<B>>>"
