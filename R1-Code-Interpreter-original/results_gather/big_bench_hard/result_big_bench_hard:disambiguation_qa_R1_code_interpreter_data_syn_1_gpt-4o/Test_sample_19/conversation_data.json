    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The mechanic called to inform the customer that his car would be ready in the morning.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the mechanic\" and \"the customer.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the context**:\n   - The sentence describes a situation where a mechanic is calling a customer. \n   - The typical context in such a scenario is that a mechanic is working on a customer's car, not their own.\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - Given the context, it is more logical to assume that the mechanic is informing the customer about the status of the customer's car. \n   - Therefore, \"his car\" most likely refers to the customer's car.\n\n4. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - (A) It was the mechanic's car: This is unlikely given the context.\n   - (B) It was the customer's car: This is the most logical interpretation.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: The sentence is not ambiguous because the context strongly suggests that \"his\" refers to the customer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable conclusion is that \"his\" refers to the customer's car.\n\n<<<B>>>"
