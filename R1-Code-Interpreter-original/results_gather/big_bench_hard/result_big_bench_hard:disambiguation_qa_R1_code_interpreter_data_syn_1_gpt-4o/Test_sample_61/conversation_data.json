    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"Bailey planned to meet the director at her office,\" we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\n1. The sentence involves two people: Bailey and the director.\n2. The pronoun \"her\" is used to refer to a female person or a female-associated noun.\n3. The sentence structure suggests that \"her office\" is the location where the meeting is planned to take place.\n\nIn English, when a pronoun is used, it typically refers to the closest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, \"her\" could refer to either Bailey or the director, but it is more common for the pronoun to refer to the most recently mentioned noun, which is \"the director.\"\n\nTherefore, the most likely interpretation is that \"her office\" refers to the director's office. However, without additional context, it is possible that \"her\" could refer to Bailey if the sentence were part of a larger context where Bailey's office was previously mentioned.\n\nGiven the sentence alone, the most straightforward interpretation is that \"her office\" refers to the director's office.\n\nThus, the best option is:\n(A) The office was the director's office\n\n<<<answer A>>>"
