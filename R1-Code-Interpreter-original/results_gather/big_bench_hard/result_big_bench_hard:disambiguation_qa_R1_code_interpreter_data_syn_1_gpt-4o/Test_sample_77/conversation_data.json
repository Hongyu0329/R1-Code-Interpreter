    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence \"The technician told the customer that they could pay with cash,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is structured as \"The technician told the customer that they could pay with cash.\"\n   - The pronoun \"they\" follows the clause \"The technician told the customer that.\"\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**:\n   - In English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in number and gender. However, \"they\" is a plural pronoun and can also be used as a singular gender-neutral pronoun.\n   - In this sentence, \"they\" could refer to either \"the technician\" or \"the customer,\" as both are singular entities that could logically be involved in a payment transaction.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**:\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"they\" refers to \"the technician\" or \"the customer.\" Both could logically be the ones making a payment, depending on the situation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the sentence does not provide enough context to definitively determine whether \"they\" refers to \"the technician\" or \"the customer,\" the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
