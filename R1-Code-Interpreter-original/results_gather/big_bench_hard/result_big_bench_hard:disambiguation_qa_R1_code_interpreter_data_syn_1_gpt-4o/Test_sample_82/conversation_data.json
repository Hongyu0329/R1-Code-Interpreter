    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The surgeon warned the nurse that they needed more time to prepare.\"\n\n1. **Pronoun Analysis**: The pronoun \"they\" is typically used as a plural pronoun or as a singular gender-neutral pronoun. In this context, it is used to refer to a singular entity, either the surgeon or the nurse, since there are no other plural entities mentioned.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence structure \"The surgeon warned the nurse that they needed more time to prepare\" suggests that the warning is about the need for more time. However, it does not specify who exactly needs more time. Both the surgeon and the nurse could potentially need more time to prepare.\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: Since the sentence does not provide any additional context or clues to definitively determine whether the surgeon or the nurse needs more time, the antecedent of \"they\" is ambiguous. The sentence could mean either the surgeon or the nurse needed more time, or it could imply both, but it is not clear from the sentence alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
