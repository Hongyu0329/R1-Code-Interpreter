    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"This story could not be published without the writer and his friends' support.\"\n\nThe sentence mentions \"the writer and his friends' support.\" The pronoun \"his\" is used to indicate possession, and it is referring to someone who possesses the friends. The structure \"the writer and his friends\" suggests that \"his\" is referring to the writer, as it is common in English to use a possessive pronoun to refer back to the closest noun that makes logical sense. \n\nTherefore, \"his friends\" refers to the friends of the writer. The sentence is structured in a way that implies the writer has friends who provided support for the publication of the story.\n\nNow, let's match this understanding with the given options:\n\n(A) They were the writer's friends - This option correctly identifies \"his friends\" as the writer's friends.\n(B) They were the friends' friends - This option is incorrect because it suggests a different group of friends.\n(C) They were the story's friends - This option is incorrect because it doesn't make logical sense for a story to have friends.\n(D) Ambiguous - This option is incorrect because the sentence structure clearly indicates the antecedent.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
