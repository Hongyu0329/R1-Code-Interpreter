    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The scientist collaborates with the artist, and he shares a story,\" we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The scientist collaborates with the artist\" and \"he shares a story.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned noun that matches in gender and number. In this sentence, both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are male, as indicated by the pronoun \"he.\"\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: Since both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are potential antecedents for \"he,\" and there is no additional context or information to clarify which one is intended, the pronoun reference is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, without further context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the scientist\" or \"the artist.\"\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
