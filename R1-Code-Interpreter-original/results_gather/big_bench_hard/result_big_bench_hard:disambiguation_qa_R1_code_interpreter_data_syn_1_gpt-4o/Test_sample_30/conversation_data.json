    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the structure and context of the sentence:\n\n\"The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold them some garbage.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Role**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"them.\"\n   - \"Them\" is the object of the verb \"sold.\"\n\n2. **Identify Possible Antecedents**:\n   - The sentence mentions two people: \"the salesperson\" and \"the writer.\"\n   - \"Them\" could refer to either \"the salesperson\" or \"the writer.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence Structure**:\n   - The sentence structure suggests that \"the salesperson\" is the subject who performed the action of trying to fool and selling.\n   - \"The writer\" is the object of the action \"tried to fool.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" follows the action \"sold,\" which is performed by \"the salesperson.\"\n   - The logical flow of the sentence suggests that \"the salesperson\" sold something to \"the writer.\"\n   - Therefore, \"them\" most likely refers to \"the writer.\"\n\n5. **Consider Ambiguity**:\n   - The sentence does not provide any additional context that would suggest \"them\" refers to \"the salesperson.\"\n   - The most straightforward interpretation is that \"them\" refers to \"the writer.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely antecedent of \"them\" is \"the writer.\" Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B) Sold the writer some garbage\n\n<<<B>>>"
