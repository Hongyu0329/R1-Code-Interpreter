    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The manager sent a message to the secretary, but she didn't reply yet,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. The sentence has two main parts: \"The manager sent a message to the secretary\" and \"but she didn't reply yet.\"\n2. The pronoun \"she\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n3. In the first part, there are two people mentioned: \"The manager\" and \"the secretary.\"\n4. The action of sending a message is performed by \"The manager,\" and the recipient of the message is \"the secretary.\"\n5. The second part of the sentence, \"but she didn't reply yet,\" suggests that the person who is expected to reply is the one who received the message.\n6. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that \"she\" refers to \"the secretary,\" as she is the one who would be expected to reply to the message sent by the manager.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct option is:\n(A) The secretary didn't reply yet\n\nThus, the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" is \"the secretary.\"\n\n<<<A>>>"
