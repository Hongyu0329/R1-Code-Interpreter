    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The mechanic disliked the cashier because he is arrogant,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context provided.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The mechanic disliked the cashier\" and \"because he is arrogant.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recent noun that matches in gender and number. In this case, \"he\" is a masculine singular pronoun, and both \"the mechanic\" and \"the cashier\" are potential antecedents.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence provides a reason for the mechanic's dislike: \"because he is arrogant.\" This suggests that the arrogance is a characteristic of the person being disliked. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that \"he\" refers to \"the cashier,\" as the arrogance is the reason for the mechanic's dislike.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the sentence structure and the logical flow of the sentence, \"he\" most likely refers to \"the cashier.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The cashier is arrogant.\n\n<<<B>>>"
