    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence:\n\n\"The worker told the pedestrian that she should avoid the closed portion of the street.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"she.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the worker\" and \"the pedestrian.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure**:\n   - The sentence is structured as a reporting clause (\"The worker told the pedestrian\") followed by a subordinate clause (\"that she should avoid the closed portion of the street\").\n   - In English, when a pronoun is used in a subordinate clause following a reporting verb, it typically refers to the object of the reporting verb, unless context suggests otherwise.\n\n3. **Contextual understanding**:\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context to suggest that \"she\" refers to \"the worker.\"\n   - The default interpretation, based on sentence structure, is that \"she\" refers to \"the pedestrian,\" as the pedestrian is the one being told something.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, the most likely antecedent for \"she\" is \"the pedestrian.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion.\n\n<<<B>>>"
