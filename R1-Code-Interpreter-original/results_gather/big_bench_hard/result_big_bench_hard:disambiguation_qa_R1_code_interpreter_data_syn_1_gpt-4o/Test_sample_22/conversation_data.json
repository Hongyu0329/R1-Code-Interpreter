    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The developer argued with the designer because he liked the design,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The developer argued with the designer\" and \"because he liked the design.\" The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the developer\" or \"the designer.\"\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence does not provide any additional context or clues that would help us determine who \"he\" refers to. Both the developer and the designer are equally plausible candidates for liking the design.\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: Since there is no clear indication or context that specifies whether \"he\" refers to the developer or the designer, the pronoun is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<Ambiguous>>>"
