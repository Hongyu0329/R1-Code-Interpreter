    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence is composed of two main parts: \"Alex did not know Taylor\" and \"until he sent a letter.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recent noun of the same gender. In this case, both \"Alex\" and \"Taylor\" are potential antecedents for \"he,\" as they are both male names.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: The sentence does not provide additional context or clues to definitively determine who \"he\" refers to. Without further context, it is unclear whether \"he\" refers to Alex or Taylor.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Since both Alex and Taylor are equally likely to be the antecedent of \"he,\" and there is no additional information to clarify the reference, the pronoun \"he\" is ambiguous in this sentence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is (C) Ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
