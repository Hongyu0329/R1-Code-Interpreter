    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support,\" we need to analyze the structure of the sentence.\n\n1. The sentence mentions \"the writer and her friends' support.\" The pronoun \"her\" is possessive and is used to indicate ownership or association.\n2. The structure \"the writer and her friends\" suggests that \"her\" is referring to the writer. This is because the possessive pronoun \"her\" is used to show that the friends belong to the writer.\n3. Therefore, \"her friends\" means the friends of the writer.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) They were the writer's friends - This option is consistent with the analysis that \"her\" refers to the writer, making \"her friends\" the writer's friends.\n\n(B) They were the friends' friends - This option is incorrect because \"her\" does not refer to the friends' friends.\n\n(C) They were the story's friends - This option is incorrect because \"her\" does not refer to the story.\n\n(D) Ambiguous - This option is incorrect because the sentence structure clearly indicates that \"her\" refers to the writer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
