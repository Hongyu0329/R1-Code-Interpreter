    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The mechanic greets the receptionist because he is standing in front of the door,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two parts: \"The mechanic greets the receptionist\" and \"because he is standing in front of the door.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: The pronoun \"he\" could refer to either \"the mechanic\" or \"the receptionist.\" In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recently mentioned male noun, but this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The sentence provides a causal relationship: the mechanic greets the receptionist because \"he\" is standing in front of the door. This implies that the action of standing in front of the door is the reason for the greeting. \n\n4. **Logical Interpretation**: \n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the mechanic,\" it suggests that the mechanic is standing in front of the door, which is why he greets the receptionist. This interpretation seems less logical because it doesn't clearly explain why standing in front of the door would lead to greeting someone.\n   - If \"he\" refers to \"the receptionist,\" it suggests that the receptionist is standing in front of the door, which prompts the mechanic to greet him. This interpretation is more logical as it implies that the mechanic greets the receptionist upon encountering him at the door.\n\n5. **Ambiguity Consideration**: Despite the logical interpretation, the sentence does not provide explicit information to definitively determine the antecedent of \"he.\" Both interpretations are grammatically possible, and without additional context, the pronoun reference remains ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate conclusion is that the antecedent of \"he\" is ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
