    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The scientist will collaborate with the artist, and he will share a story,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The scientist will collaborate with the artist\" and \"he will share a story.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recent noun of the same gender. In this sentence, both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are male-gendered nouns, as indicated by the pronoun \"he.\"\n\n3. **Ambiguity**: Since both \"the scientist\" and \"the artist\" are potential antecedents for \"he,\" and there is no additional context provided to clarify which one is intended, the pronoun reference is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"he\" refers to \"the scientist\" or \"the artist.\"\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
