    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"her\" in the sentence \"The customer and the chef discuss her culinary training,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Pronoun Analysis**: The pronoun \"her\" is a possessive pronoun, which means it refers to something belonging to a female person or entity mentioned earlier in the sentence.\n\n2. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence has two subjects: \"The customer\" and \"the chef.\" Both are potential antecedents for the pronoun \"her.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: In the absence of additional context, we rely on typical sentence structure and common usage. Generally, when two subjects are mentioned, the pronoun often refers to the latter subject unless context suggests otherwise. However, this is not a strict rule and can vary based on context.\n\n4. **Ambiguity Consideration**: Without additional context, it is unclear whether \"her\" refers to the customer or the chef. Both are equally plausible antecedents for \"her culinary training.\"\n\nGiven the lack of specific context indicating which individual the pronoun \"her\" refers to, the antecedent is ambiguous.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
