    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context in which the pronoun is used.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence has two main parts: \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter\" and \"gave them a blueprint.\"\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Analysis**:\n   - The pronoun \"them\" is typically used to refer to a plural noun or a singular non-binary individual. However, in this context, it is more likely referring to a plural noun since both \"the designer\" and \"the carpenter\" are mentioned.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**:\n   - The sentence does not provide any additional context to clearly indicate whether the blueprint was given to the designer or the carpenter.\n   - Both \"the designer\" and \"the carpenter\" are equally plausible recipients of the blueprint.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without additional context or information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the blueprint was given to the designer or the carpenter. Therefore, the antecedent of \"them\" is ambiguous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is:\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
