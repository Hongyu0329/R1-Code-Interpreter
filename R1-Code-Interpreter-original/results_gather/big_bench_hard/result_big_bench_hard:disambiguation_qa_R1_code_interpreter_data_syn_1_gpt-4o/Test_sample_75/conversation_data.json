    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence \"The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave him a discount,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence has two main actions: \"made a desk for the clerk\" and \"gave him a discount.\"\n   - The pronoun \"him\" follows the action of giving a discount.\n\n2. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The carpenter is the subject performing both actions: making a desk and giving a discount.\n   - The desk is made for the clerk, which implies that the clerk is the recipient of the desk.\n   - The pronoun \"him\" is likely referring to the recipient of the discount.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction**:\n   - Since the desk is made for the clerk, it is logical to deduce that the discount is also given to the clerk as a customer or recipient of the desk.\n   - There is no indication in the sentence that the carpenter would give himself a discount.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"him\" is the clerk. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B) Gave the clerk a discount\n\nThus, the pronoun \"him\" refers to the clerk, not the carpenter.\n\n<<<B>>>"
