    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"The educator was meeting with a student to discuss his grading policy,\" we need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence.\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"his.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the educator\" and \"a student.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the context**:\n   - The sentence involves a meeting between an educator and a student.\n   - The topic of discussion is \"his grading policy.\"\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - In an educational context, it is more common for an educator to have a grading policy rather than a student. \n   - Therefore, it is more logical to assume that \"his grading policy\" refers to the educator's grading policy.\n\n4. **Consider ambiguity**:\n   - While it is possible for a student to have a personal grading policy (e.g., a personal standard or method for evaluating their own work), this is less common and not typically referred to as a \"grading policy.\"\n   - The sentence does not provide additional context to suggest that the student has a grading policy.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"his grading policy\" refers to the educator's grading policy. Therefore, the antecedent of \"his\" is most likely \"the educator.\"\n\n<<<(A) It was the educator's grading policy>>>"
