    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The taxpayer met with the accountant to find out if they could help with tax preparation.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Pronoun and Its Possible Antecedents:**\n   - The pronoun in question is \"they.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the taxpayer\" and \"the accountant.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Context:**\n   - The sentence describes a meeting between the taxpayer and the accountant.\n   - The purpose of the meeting is to find out if someone could help with tax preparation.\n\n3. **Determine the Most Likely Antecedent:**\n   - Typically, in the context of tax preparation, it is the accountant who is expected to provide help or services. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that \"they\" refers to \"the accountant.\"\n\n4. **Consider Ambiguity:**\n   - While the context suggests that the accountant is the one who would help with tax preparation, the sentence structure does not explicitly clarify this. Therefore, there is a potential for ambiguity if the context is not considered.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"they\" is \"the accountant,\" but without additional context, it could be considered ambiguous. However, given the typical roles in tax preparation, the most reasonable interpretation is that \"they\" refers to \"the accountant.\"\n\nTherefore, the best option is:\n(B) The accountant could help\n\n<<<B>>>"
