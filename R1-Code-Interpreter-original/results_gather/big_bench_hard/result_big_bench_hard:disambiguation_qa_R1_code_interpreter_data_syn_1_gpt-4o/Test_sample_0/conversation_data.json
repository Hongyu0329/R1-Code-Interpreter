    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence, we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence. The sentence is: \"The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.\"\n\n1. **Identify the pronoun and its possible antecedents**: \n   - The pronoun in question is \"he.\"\n   - The possible antecedents are \"the patient\" and \"the specialist.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the sentence structure and context**:\n   - The sentence structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship: \"The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.\"\n   - Typically, in such sentences, the pronoun refers to the subject of the main clause unless there is a clear indication otherwise.\n\n3. **Determine the most likely antecedent**:\n   - The main clause is \"The patient was referred to the specialist.\"\n   - The reason for the referral is given as \"because he had a rare skin condition.\"\n   - It is more logical that the patient is the one with the skin condition, as this would be the reason for the referral to a specialist.\n\n4. **Consider the options**:\n   - (A) The patient had a skin condition: This is consistent with the typical interpretation of such sentences.\n   - (B) The specialist had a skin condition: This is less likely, as it does not logically explain why the patient was referred to the specialist.\n   - (C) Ambiguous: While technically possible, the sentence structure and typical usage suggest that it is not ambiguous.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most logical antecedent for \"he\" is \"the patient.\"\n\n<<<A>>>"
