    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" in the sentence \"The hygienist told the patient that she should floss every day,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence is composed of two parts: \"The hygienist told the patient\" and \"that she should floss every day.\"\n   - The pronoun \"she\" appears in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**:\n   - The pronoun \"she\" could refer to either \"the hygienist\" or \"the patient.\"\n   - In English, pronouns typically refer to the nearest preceding noun that matches in gender and number. However, this is not a strict rule and context often plays a significant role.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**:\n   - In the context of dental hygiene, it is more common for a hygienist to advise a patient to floss every day rather than advising themselves.\n   - Therefore, it is more likely that \"she\" refers to \"the patient.\"\n\n4. **Ambiguity Consideration**:\n   - Despite the contextual clue, the sentence structure does not provide a definitive antecedent for \"she.\"\n   - Without additional context, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether \"she\" refers to \"the hygienist\" or \"the patient.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the pronoun \"she\" is ambiguous because it could logically refer to either the hygienist or the patient, depending on the context or additional information not provided in the sentence.\n\n<<<C) Ambiguous>>>"
