    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"him\" in the sentence \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave him a prototype,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: \n   - The sentence has two main parts: \"The carpenter collaborated with the designer\" and \"gave him a prototype.\"\n   - The subject of the sentence is \"The carpenter,\" who is performing the action of collaborating and giving.\n\n2. **Pronoun \"him\"**:\n   - The pronoun \"him\" is used to refer to a male individual who is the recipient of the action \"gave.\"\n   - In the context of the sentence, \"him\" could refer to either \"the carpenter\" or \"the designer.\"\n\n3. **Logical Analysis**:\n   - Since the carpenter is the subject and the one performing the action, it is more logical that the carpenter is giving the prototype to the designer.\n   - Therefore, \"him\" is more likely to refer to \"the designer.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the sentence structure and logical analysis, the pronoun \"him\" most likely refers to \"the designer.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) Gave the designer a prototype.\n\n<<<answer B>>>"
