    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"their\" in the sentence \"Bailey planned to meet the director at their office,\" we need to analyze the context and the structure of the sentence.\n\n1. The sentence mentions two entities: \"Bailey\" and \"the director.\"\n2. The pronoun \"their\" is used to refer to a singular entity in a gender-neutral way or to refer to a plural entity. In this context, it is used in a singular, gender-neutral form.\n3. The phrase \"at their office\" suggests that the office belongs to one of the two entities mentioned.\n4. Typically, when referring to someone's office in a professional context, it is more common to refer to the office of the person being visited, which in this case is \"the director.\"\n\nBased on these observations, the most logical antecedent for \"their\" is \"the director,\" as it is more common to meet someone at their own office rather than at the visitor's office.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(A) The office was the director's office\n\n<<<answer A>>>"
