    "To determine the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"The nurse was running from the laborer because he smelled awful,\" we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\n1. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence consists of two main parts: \"The nurse was running from the laborer\" and \"because he smelled awful.\" The pronoun \"he\" is used in the second part of the sentence.\n\n2. **Pronoun Reference**: In English, pronouns typically refer to the most recent noun of the same gender. In this sentence, \"he\" is a masculine pronoun, and the most recent masculine noun is \"the laborer.\"\n\n3. **Logical Context**: The sentence implies a cause-and-effect relationship: the nurse is running away because someone smelled awful. It is more logical to assume that the laborer is the one who smelled awful, as this would provide a reason for the nurse to run away.\n\nBased on the sentence structure and logical context, the pronoun \"he\" most likely refers to \"the laborer.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(B) The laborer smelled awful\n\n<<<B>>>"
