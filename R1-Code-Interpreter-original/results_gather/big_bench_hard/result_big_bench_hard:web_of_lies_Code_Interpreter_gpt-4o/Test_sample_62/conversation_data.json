    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Delfina lies.**\n   - This is a given statement.\n\n2. **Leda says Delfina lies.**\n   - If Leda is telling the truth, then Delfina indeed lies, which is consistent with the given statement.\n\n3. **Fidel says Leda lies.**\n   - If Fidel is telling the truth, then Leda lies, which means Delfina does not lie. This contradicts the given statement that Delfina lies. Therefore, Fidel must be lying.\n\n4. **Sal says Fidel tells the truth.**\n   - Since we determined that Fidel is lying, Sal must be lying as well.\n\n5. **Andree says Sal lies.**\n   - Since Sal is lying, Andree is telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, Andree tells the truth.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
