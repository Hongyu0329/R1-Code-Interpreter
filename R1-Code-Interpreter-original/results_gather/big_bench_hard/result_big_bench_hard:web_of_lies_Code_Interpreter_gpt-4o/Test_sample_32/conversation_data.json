    "\nassistant > To determine if Shenna tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements made by each person and their implications:\n\n1. **Delfina tells the truth.**\n2. **Willian says Delfina tells the truth.**  \n   - If Willian tells the truth, then Delfina tells the truth (which is consistent with Delfina's statement).\n3. **Crista says Willian lies.**  \n   - If Crista tells the truth, then Willian lies, which means Delfina does not tell the truth (contradicting Delfina's statement).\n4. **Shalonda says Crista lies.**  \n   - If Shalonda tells the truth, then Crista lies, which means Willian tells the truth, and therefore Delfina tells the truth.\n5. **Shenna says Shalonda tells the truth.**  \n   - If Shenna tells the truth, then Shalonda tells the truth, which means Crista lies, Willian tells the truth, and Delfina tells the truth.\n\nLet's analyze the consistency:\n\n- If Delfina tells the truth, then Willian tells the truth.\n- If Willian tells the truth, then Crista lies.\n- If Crista lies, then Shalonda tells the truth.\n- If Shalonda tells the truth, then Shenna tells the truth.\n\nThis chain of logic is consistent, so Shenna does tell the truth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes, Shenna tells the truth."
