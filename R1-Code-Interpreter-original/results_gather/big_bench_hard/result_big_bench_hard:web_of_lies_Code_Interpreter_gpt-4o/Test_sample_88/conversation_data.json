    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Helene tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. If Helene tells the truth, then her statement is true.\n\n2. **Lorine says Helene lies.**\n   - If Helene tells the truth, then Lorine's statement must be false (since Helene does not lie). Therefore, Lorine is lying.\n\n3. **Raymond says Lorine tells the truth.**\n   - Since Lorine is lying, Raymond's statement is false. Therefore, Raymond is lying.\n\n4. **Ka says Raymond tells the truth.**\n   - Since Raymond is lying, Ka's statement is false. Therefore, Ka is lying.\n\n5. **Christie says Ka tells the truth.**\n   - Since Ka is lying, Christie's statement is false. Therefore, Christie is lying.\n\nThus, Christie does not tell the truth.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Christie does not tell the truth>>>"
