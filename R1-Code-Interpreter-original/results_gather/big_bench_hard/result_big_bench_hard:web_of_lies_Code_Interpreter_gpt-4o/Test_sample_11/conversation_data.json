    "\nassistant > To determine if Helene tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and their implications:\n\n1. **Audrie lies.**\n2. **Conception says Audrie lies.**  \n   - If Conception tells the truth, then Audrie indeed lies.\n   - If Conception lies, then Audrie tells the truth.\n\n3. **Teressa says Conception tells the truth.**  \n   - If Teressa tells the truth, then Conception tells the truth, which means Audrie lies.\n   - If Teressa lies, then Conception lies, which means Audrie tells the truth.\n\n4. **Delfina says Teressa lies.**  \n   - If Delfina tells the truth, then Teressa lies, which means Conception lies, and Audrie tells the truth.\n   - If Delfina lies, then Teressa tells the truth, which means Conception tells the truth, and Audrie lies.\n\n5. **Helene says Delfina tells the truth.**  \n   - If Helene tells the truth, then Delfina tells the truth, which means Teressa lies, Conception lies, and Audrie tells the truth.\n   - If Helene lies, then Delfina lies, which means Teressa tells the truth, Conception tells the truth, and Audrie lies.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Helene tells the truth, then Delfina tells the truth, Teressa lies, Conception lies, and Audrie tells the truth. This is consistent.\n- If Helene lies, then Delfina lies, Teressa tells the truth, Conception tells the truth, and Audrie lies. This is also consistent.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent, but we need to determine which one is correct. Let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Helene tells the truth, then Audrie tells the truth, which contradicts the initial statement that Audrie lies.\n- If Helene lies, then Audrie lies, which is consistent with the initial statement.\n\nTherefore, Helene must be lying.\n\n<<<answer>>> Helene does not tell the truth."
