    "\nassistant > To determine if Gwenn tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and their implications:\n\n1. **Audrie lies.**\n2. **Sherrie says Audrie lies.**\n   - If Sherrie tells the truth, then Audrie indeed lies.\n   - If Sherrie lies, then Audrie tells the truth.\n\n3. **Willian says Sherrie tells the truth.**\n   - If Willian tells the truth, then Sherrie tells the truth, which means Audrie lies.\n   - If Willian lies, then Sherrie lies, which means Audrie tells the truth.\n\n4. **Conception says Willian tells the truth.**\n   - If Conception tells the truth, then Willian tells the truth, which means Sherrie tells the truth, and Audrie lies.\n   - If Conception lies, then Willian lies, which means Sherrie lies, and Audrie tells the truth.\n\n5. **Gwenn says Conception lies.**\n   - If Gwenn tells the truth, then Conception lies, which means Willian lies, Sherrie lies, and Audrie tells the truth.\n   - If Gwenn lies, then Conception tells the truth, which means Willian tells the truth, Sherrie tells the truth, and Audrie lies.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these scenarios:\n\n- If Gwenn tells the truth:\n  - Conception lies, Willian lies, Sherrie lies, Audrie tells the truth.\n  - This is consistent because if Audrie tells the truth, then Sherrie lies, which means Willian lies, and Conception lies.\n\n- If Gwenn lies:\n  - Conception tells the truth, Willian tells the truth, Sherrie tells the truth, Audrie lies.\n  - This is consistent because if Audrie lies, then Sherrie tells the truth, which means Willian tells the truth, and Conception tells the truth.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent, but the problem asks if Gwenn tells the truth. Since both scenarios are possible, we cannot definitively say that Gwenn tells the truth without additional information. However, the problem seems to imply a single solution, so we should consider the scenario where Gwenn tells the truth as the intended solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>Gwenn tells the truth."
