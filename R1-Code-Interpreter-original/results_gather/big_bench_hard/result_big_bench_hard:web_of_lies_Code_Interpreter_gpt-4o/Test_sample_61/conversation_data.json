    "\nassistant > To determine if Helene tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and their implications:\n\n1. **Maybelle tells the truth.**\n2. **Bernita says Maybelle tells the truth.**  \n   - If Bernita tells the truth, then Maybelle tells the truth (which is consistent with Maybelle's statement).\n3. **Inga says Bernita tells the truth.**  \n   - If Inga tells the truth, then Bernita tells the truth, which implies Maybelle tells the truth.\n4. **Tamika says Inga lies.**  \n   - If Tamika tells the truth, then Inga lies, which means Bernita does not tell the truth, and Maybelle does not tell the truth.\n5. **Helene says Tamika tells the truth.**  \n   - If Helene tells the truth, then Tamika tells the truth, which means Inga lies.\n\nLet's analyze the consistency:\n\n- If Maybelle tells the truth, then Bernita tells the truth, and Inga tells the truth.
