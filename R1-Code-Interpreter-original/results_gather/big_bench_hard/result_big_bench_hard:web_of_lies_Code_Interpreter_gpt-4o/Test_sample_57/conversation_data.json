    "\nassistant > To determine if Shalonda tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and their implications:\n\n1. **Jerry lies.**\n2. **Helene says Jerry lies.**  \n   - If Helene tells the truth, then Jerry indeed lies.\n   - If Helene lies, then Jerry does not lie (i.e., Jerry tells the truth).\n\n3. **Kandi says Helene tells the truth.**  \n   - If Kandi tells the truth, then Helene tells the truth, which means Jerry lies.\n   - If Kandi lies, then Helene does not tell the truth, which means Jerry tells the truth.\n\n4. **Jaymie says Kandi lies.**  \n   - If Jaymie tells the truth, then Kandi lies, which means Helene does not tell the truth, and Jerry tells the truth.\n   - If Jaymie lies, then Kandi tells the truth, which means Helene tells the truth, and Jerry lies.\n\n5. **Shalonda says Jaymie lies.**  \n   - If Shalonda tells the truth, then Jaymie lies, which means Kandi tells the truth, Helene tells the truth, and Jerry lies.\n   - If Shalonda lies, then Jaymie tells the truth, which means Kandi lies, Helene does not tell the truth, and Jerry tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Shalonda tells the truth, then Jaymie lies, Kandi tells the truth, Helene tells the truth, and Jerry lies. This is consistent.\n- If Shalonda lies, then Jaymie tells the truth, Kandi lies, Helene does not tell the truth, and Jerry tells the truth. This is also consistent.\n\nHowever, we need to determine which scenario is logically consistent with the initial statement that \"Jerry lies.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the scenarios:\n\n1. **Scenario 1: Shalonda tells the truth.**\n   - Jaymie lies.\n   - Kandi tells the truth.\n   - Helene tells the truth.\n   - Jerry lies.\n\n2. **Scenario 2: Shalonda lies.**\n   - Jaymie tells the truth.\n   - Kandi lies.\n   - Helene does not tell the truth.\n   - Jerry tells the truth.\n\nSince the initial statement is \"Jerry lies,\" Scenario 1 is consistent with this statement. Therefore, Shalonda tells the truth.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Shalonda tells the truth>>>"
