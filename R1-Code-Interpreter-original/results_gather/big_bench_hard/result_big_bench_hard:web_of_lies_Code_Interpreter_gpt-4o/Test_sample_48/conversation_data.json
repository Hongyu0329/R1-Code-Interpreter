    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Audrie tells the truth.**\n   - This means Audrie's statement is true.\n\n2. **Yoland says Audrie lies.**\n   - If Yoland is telling the truth, then Audrie is lying, which contradicts Audrie's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Yoland must be lying.\n\n3. **Shaunda says Yoland tells the truth.**\n   - Since Yoland is lying, Shaunda's statement that Yoland tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Shaunda is lying.\n\n4. **Raymond says Shaunda lies.**\n   - Since Shaunda is indeed lying, Raymond's statement is true. Therefore, Raymond is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Maybelle says Raymond lies.**\n   - Since Raymond is telling the truth, Maybelle's statement that Raymond lies must be false. Therefore, Maybelle is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, Maybelle does not tell the truth.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Maybelle does not tell the truth>>>"
