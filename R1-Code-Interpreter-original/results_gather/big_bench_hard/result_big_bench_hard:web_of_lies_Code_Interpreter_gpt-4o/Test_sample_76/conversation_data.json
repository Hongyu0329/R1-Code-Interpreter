Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Conception tells the truth.**\n   - This is our starting point. If Conception tells the truth, then any statement made by Conception is true.\n\n2. **Teressa says Conception lies.**\n   - If Teressa says Conception lies, and we know Conception tells the truth, then Teressa must be lying.\n\n3. **Sal says Teressa tells the truth.**\n   - Since Teressa is lying, Sal's statement that Teressa tells the truth must also be a lie. Therefore, Sal is lying.\n\n4. **Fidel says Sal tells the truth.**\n   - Since Sal is lying, Fidel's statement that Sal tells the truth is also a lie. Therefore, Fidel is lying.\n\n5. **Shenna says Fidel lies.**\n   - Since Fidel is lying, Shenna's statement that Fidel lies is true.
