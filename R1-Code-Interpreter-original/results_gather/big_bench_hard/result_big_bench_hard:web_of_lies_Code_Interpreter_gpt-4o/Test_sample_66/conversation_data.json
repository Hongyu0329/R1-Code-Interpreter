    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Sima tells the truth.**\n   - This means Sima's statement is true.\n\n2. **Michaela says Sima lies.**\n   - If Michaela is telling the truth, then Sima is lying, which contradicts Sima's statement that she tells the truth. Therefore, Michaela must be lying.\n\n3. **Leda says Michaela tells the truth.**\n   - Since Michaela is lying, Leda's statement that Michaela tells the truth must be false. Therefore, Leda is lying.\n\n4. **Fletcher says Leda lies.**\n   - Since Leda is lying, Fletcher's statement that Leda lies is true. Therefore, Fletcher is telling the truth.\n\n5. **Vina says Fletcher tells the truth.**\n   - Since Fletcher is telling the truth, Vina's statement that Fletcher tells the truth is also true.\n\nTherefore, Vina tells the truth.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Vina tells the truth>>>."
