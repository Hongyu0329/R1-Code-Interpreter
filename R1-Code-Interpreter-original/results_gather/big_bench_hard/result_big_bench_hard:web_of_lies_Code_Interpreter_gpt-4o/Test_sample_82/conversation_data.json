    "\nassistant > To determine if Conception tells the truth, we need to analyze the statements and their implications:\n\n1. **Elanor lies.**\n2. **Tamika says Elanor lies.**\n   - If Tamika tells the truth, then Elanor indeed lies.\n   - If Tamika lies, then Elanor tells the truth.\n\n3. **Ka says Tamika tells the truth.**\n   - If Ka tells the truth, then Tamika tells the truth, which means Elanor lies.\n   - If Ka lies, then Tamika lies, which means Elanor tells the truth.\n\n4. **Shaunda says Ka lies.**\n   - If Shaunda tells the truth, then Ka lies, which means Tamika lies, and Elanor tells the truth.\n   - If Shaunda lies, then Ka tells the truth, which means Tamika tells the truth, and Elanor lies.\n\n5. **Conception says Shaunda lies.**\n   - If Conception tells the truth, then Shaunda lies, which means Ka tells the truth, Tamika tells the truth, and Elanor lies.\n   - If Conception lies, then Shaunda tells the truth, which means Ka lies, Tamika lies, and Elanor tells the truth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these scenarios:\n\n- If Conception tells the truth:\n  - Shaunda lies, so Ka tells the truth.\n  - Ka tells the truth, so Tamika tells the truth.\n  - Tamika tells the truth, so Elanor lies.\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\n- If Conception lies:\n  - Shaunda tells the truth, so Ka lies.\n  - Ka lies, so Tamika lies.\n  - Tamika lies, so Elanor tells the truth.\n  - This scenario is also consistent.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent, but since we are asked if Conception tells the truth, we can conclude that it is possible for Conception to tell the truth without any contradictions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<yes>>>"
