Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Every supporter of Tottenham Hotspur is not an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and not a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n2. Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio is a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Premise 1** implies that if someone is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur, they cannot be both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n- **Premise 2** states that if someone is both a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio and an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ, they must be either a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\nThe conclusion claims that anyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio must be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n- If someone is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they could either be:\n  - Not a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, or\n  - Not an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n\n- From **Premise 2**, if someone is both a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio and an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ, they are either a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not both, they must be a devotee of FC Zenit. However, the premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that everyone who is not both must be a devotee of FC Zenit. The premises only cover the case where someone is both, not the case where someone is not both.\n\nTherefore, the argument does not logically follow from the premises, making it deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
