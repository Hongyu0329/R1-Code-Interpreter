    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a workmate of Monte is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a workmate of Monte, then they are an ancestor of Patrick.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Not being an ancestor of Nathan is sufficient for not being a workmate of Monte.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, then they are not a workmate of Monte.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an ancestor of Nathan is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, then they are an ancestor of Patrick.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's break it down:\n\n- From the second premise, if someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, they are not a workmate of Monte.\n- From the first premise, if someone is not a workmate of Monte, they are an ancestor of Patrick.\n\nCombining these two, if someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, they are not a workmate of Monte, and therefore, they are an ancestor of Patrick. This matches the conclusion.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
