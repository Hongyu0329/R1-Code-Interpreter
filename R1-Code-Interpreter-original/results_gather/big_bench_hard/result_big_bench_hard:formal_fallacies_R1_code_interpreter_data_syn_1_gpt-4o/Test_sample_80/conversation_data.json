    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Whoever is not a workmate of Hilda is a stepsister of Heather.\n2. Every workmate of Hilda is either a stepsister of Heather or an aunt of Clara, or both.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is not a workmate of Hilda, they must be a stepsister of Heather.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a workmate of Hilda, they must be either a stepsister of Heather, an aunt of Clara, or both.\n\nThe conclusion states that being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda. This implies that if someone is a workmate of Hilda, they must be an aunt of Clara.\n\nLet's consider the logical implications:\n- If being a workmate of Hilda requires being an aunt of Clara, then every workmate of Hilda must be an aunt of Clara.\n- However, Premise 2 allows for the possibility that a workmate of Hilda could be a stepsister of Heather without being an aunt of Clara (since it says \"either a stepsister of Heather or an aunt of Clara, or both\").\n\nThus, the conclusion that being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda does not follow from the premises, because the premises allow for workmates of Hilda who are not aunts of Clara.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
