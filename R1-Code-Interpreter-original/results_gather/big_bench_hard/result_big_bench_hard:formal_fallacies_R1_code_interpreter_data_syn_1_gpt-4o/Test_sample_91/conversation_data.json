    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First premise**: Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n2. **Second premise**: Oliver is not a supporter of FC Viitorul.\n3. **Third premise**: Every supporter of SK Rapid Wien is neither a supporter of FC Viitorul nor an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n\n**Conclusion**: It is false that Oliver is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- From the third premise, we know that if someone is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien, they cannot be a supporter of FC Viitorul and cannot be an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n- Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz (first premise), which is consistent with being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n- Oliver is not a supporter of FC Viitorul (second premise), which is also consistent with being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nSince both conditions for being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien are satisfied by Oliver, the conclusion that \"it is false that Oliver is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien\" does not logically follow from the premises. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
