    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml is not an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Vitamin A is an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\n\nLet's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Vitamin A is indeed an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n- Premise 2 states that for any ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it must either not be an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not be an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER. This is a disjunction (logical OR) condition.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"It is not the case that Vitamin A is an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\"\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the premises must logically lead to the conclusion. If Vitamin A were an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, then according to Premise 2, it must either not be an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not be an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER. However, Premise 1 states that Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER, which means that if Vitamin A were an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it would have to not be an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter to satisfy Premise 2.\n\nThe conclusion states that Vitamin A is not an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml. This conclusion is consistent with the premises because if Vitamin A were an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it would have to satisfy the disjunction in Premise 2, which is not possible given Premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the premises logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
