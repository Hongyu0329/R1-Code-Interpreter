    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - The first premise states: \"Nobody is neither a workmate of Calvin nor a schoolmate of Barton.\" This is a double negative, which simplifies to: \"Everyone is either a workmate of Calvin or a schoolmate of Barton.\"\n\n2. **Conclusion Analysis**:\n   - The conclusion states: \"Being a workmate of Calvin is necessary for not being a schoolmate of Barton.\"\n\n3. **Logical Structure**:\n   - From the simplified premise, we have: \\( \\forall x, (W(x) \\lor S(x)) \\), where \\( W(x) \\) means \"x is a workmate of Calvin\" and \\( S(x) \\) means \"x is a schoolmate of Barton.\"\n   - The conclusion can be interpreted as: \"If not being a schoolmate of Barton, then being a workmate of Calvin is necessary,\" which translates to: \\( \\neg S(x) \\rightarrow W(x) \\).\n\n4. **Logical Deduction**:\n   - From the premise \\( W(x) \\lor S(x) \\), we can deduce that if \\( \\neg S(x) \\) (not a schoolmate of Barton), then \\( W(x) \\) must be true to satisfy the premise. This aligns with the conclusion \\( \\neg S(x) \\rightarrow W(x) \\).\n\n5. **Validity Check**:\n   - The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does follow from the premise because the premise covers all possibilities (either being a workmate of Calvin or a schoolmate of Barton), and the conclusion correctly states the necessary condition for not being a schoolmate of Barton.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
