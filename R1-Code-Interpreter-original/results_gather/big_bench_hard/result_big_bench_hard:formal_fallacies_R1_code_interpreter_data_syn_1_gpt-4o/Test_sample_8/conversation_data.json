    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Not being an opponent to FC Utrecht is sufficient for not being an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\n   - This can be rephrased as: If someone is not an opponent to FC Utrecht, then they are not an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\n   - In logical terms: If \\( \\neg O \\) (not an opponent to FC Utrecht), then \\( \\neg A \\) (not an admirer of St Johnstone FC).\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is an admirer of St Johnstone FC is an opponent to FC Utrecht.\n   - This can be rephrased as: If someone is an admirer of St Johnstone FC, then they are an opponent to FC Utrecht.\n   - In logical terms: If \\( A \\) (an admirer of St Johnstone FC), then \\( O \\) (an opponent to FC Utrecht).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implication:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: \\( \\neg O \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n- The contrapositive of this statement is: \\( A \\rightarrow O \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion \\( A \\rightarrow O \\) is logically derived from the premise \\( \\neg O \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
