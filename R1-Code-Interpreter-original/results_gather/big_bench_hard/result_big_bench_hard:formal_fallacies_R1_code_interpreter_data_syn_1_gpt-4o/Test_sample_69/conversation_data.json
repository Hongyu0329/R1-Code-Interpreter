    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Being a stepbrother of Benjamin is necessary for being a grandson of Alan.\n2. Every half-brother of Melvin is a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n3. Everyone who is not a cousin of Solomon and not a stepbrother of Dominic is a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Someone who is not a stepbrother of Benjamin is a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Premise 1** implies that if someone is a grandson of Alan, then they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin. This can be written as: \n   - If Grandson of Alan, then Stepbrother of Benjamin.\n\n2. **Premise 2** states that every half-brother of Melvin is a stepbrother of Benjamin. This can be written as:\n   - If Half-brother of Melvin, then Stepbrother of Benjamin.\n\n3. **Premise 3** states that if someone is not a cousin of Solomon and not a stepbrother of Dominic, then they are either a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin. This can be written as:\n   - If not Cousin of Solomon and not Stepbrother of Dominic, then Grandson of Alan or Half-brother of Melvin.\n\n### Conclusion Analysis:\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a stepbrother of Benjamin, then they must be a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n- From Premise 1, if someone is a grandson of Alan, they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin. Therefore, if someone is not a stepbrother of Benjamin, they cannot be a grandson of Alan.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a half-brother of Melvin, they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin. Therefore, if someone is not a stepbrother of Benjamin, they cannot be a half-brother of Melvin.\n- From Premise 3, if someone is not a cousin of Solomon and not a stepbrother of Dominic, they must be either a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin. Since being a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin implies being a stepbrother of Benjamin, the only way for someone not to be a stepbrother of Benjamin is if they are either a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
