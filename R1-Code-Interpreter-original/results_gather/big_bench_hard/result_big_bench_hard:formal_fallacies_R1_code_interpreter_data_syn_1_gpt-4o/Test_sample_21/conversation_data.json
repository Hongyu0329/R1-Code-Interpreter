    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and the premises provided.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\n2. **Premise 2**: Nobody is neither a schoolmate of Tyler nor a nephew of Owen.\n\nThe second premise can be rephrased using logical terms: \"For any person, if they are not a schoolmate of Tyler, then they are a nephew of Owen.\" This is equivalent to saying that being a schoolmate of Tyler and being a nephew of Owen are mutually exclusive.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Cecil is not a nephew of Owen.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is not a schoolmate of Tyler, they must be a nephew of Owen. However, since Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler, this condition does not apply to him.\n- Therefore, the conclusion that Cecil is not a nephew of Owen follows directly from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured such that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
