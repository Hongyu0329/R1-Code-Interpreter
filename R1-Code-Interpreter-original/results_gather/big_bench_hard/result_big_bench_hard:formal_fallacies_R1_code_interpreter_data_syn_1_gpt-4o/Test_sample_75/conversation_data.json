    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and see if they lead to the conclusion necessarily.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. If something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, then it is not an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies or not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit.\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow (\\neg N \\lor \\neg E) \\)\n\n2. Being an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit is necessary for not being an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101.\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg I \\rightarrow E \\)\n\n3. Whatever is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 is an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies.\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg I \\rightarrow N \\)\n\nConclusion:\n- Nothing is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.\n  - This can be written as: \\( \\neg (\\neg I \\land \\neg S) \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From premise 2, \\( \\neg I \\rightarrow E \\), we know that if something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101, it must be an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit.\n- From premise 3, \\( \\neg I \\rightarrow N \\), we know that if something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101, it must be an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies.\n- From premise 1, \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow (\\neg N \\lor \\neg E) \\), if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, it cannot be both an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies and Eyebrow Kit.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \\( \\neg (\\neg I \\land \\neg S) \\), which means that it is not the case that something is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the premises logically lead to the conclusion. If something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (\\( \\neg I \\)), it must be an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies (\\( N \\)) and Eyebrow Kit (\\( E \\)) due to premises 2 and 3. However, if it is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (\\( \\neg S \\)), it cannot be both an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies and Eyebrow Kit due to premise 1. This creates a contradiction if both \\( \\neg I \\) and \\( \\neg S \\) are true, which supports the conclusion that \\( \\neg (\\neg I \\land \\neg S) \\).\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the premises logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
