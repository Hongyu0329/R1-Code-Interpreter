    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: No devotee of FK Partizan is an expert of Southampton FC.\n2. Premise 2: No critic of FC Spartak Moskva is an expert of Southampton FC.\n3. Premise 3: To be a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan is necessary for being an admirer of Qarabağ FK.\n4. Conclusion: No admirer of Qarabağ FK is an expert of Southampton FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 3, we know that anyone who admires Qarabağ FK must either be a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan.\n- From Premise 1, we know that a devotee of FK Partizan cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n- From Premise 2, we know that a critic of FC Spartak Moskva cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n\nGiven these premises, anyone who admires Qarabağ FK must fall into one of the two categories (either a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan), and neither of these categories can be an expert of Southampton FC.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that no admirer of Qarabağ FK is an expert of Southampton FC logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
