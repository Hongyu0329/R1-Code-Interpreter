    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Mildred is a daughter of Jeanette.\n2. Premise 2: Being a daughter of Jeanette is sufficient for not being a cousin of Cristi.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, no schoolmate of Mildred is a cousin of Cristi.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, then they are a daughter of Jeanette.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a daughter of Jeanette, then they are not a cousin of Cristi.\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can deduce that if someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, then they are not a cousin of Cristi. This is because being a schoolmate of Mildred implies being a daughter of Jeanette, which in turn implies not being a cousin of Cristi.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"no schoolmate of Mildred is a cousin of Cristi\" logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
