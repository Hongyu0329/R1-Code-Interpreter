    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n2. Everything that is an ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, too.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm and an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone?.\n\n### Analysis:\nLet's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, then it is either not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm (or both).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \n   - This states that all ingredients of Black Shadow are also ingredients of Hawaiian Punch.\n\n### Logical Implication:\n- From Premise 2, we know that all ingredients of Black Shadow are also ingredients of Hawaiian Punch.\n- According to Premise 1, any ingredient of Hawaiian Punch cannot be an ingredient of both Ice Queen Anyone? and Exfoliating Balm simultaneously.\n- Therefore, if an ingredient is part of Black Shadow, it cannot be an ingredient of both Ice Queen Anyone? and Exfoliating Balm at the same time.\n\n### Conclusion Analysis:\n- The conclusion states that every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of both Exfoliating Balm and Ice Queen Anyone?, which directly contradicts Premise 1.\n- Since the conclusion contradicts the premises, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\nThus, the argument does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
