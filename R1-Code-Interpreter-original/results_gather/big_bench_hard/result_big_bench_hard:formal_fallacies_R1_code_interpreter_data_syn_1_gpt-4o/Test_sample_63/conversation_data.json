    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap or not being a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is sufficient for being an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nLet's break down the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 2, we can express it in logical terms as:\n  - If (Nick is a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap) OR (Nick is not a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap), then Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know:\n  - Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n- The conclusion states that Nick is not an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the premises logically lead to the conclusion. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true for the argument to be valid.\n\nGiven Premise 2, if Nick is not a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap and is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap, then the condition for being an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo is not satisfied. Therefore, Nick is not an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo, which aligns with the conclusion.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the premises logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
