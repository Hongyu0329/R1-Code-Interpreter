    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Everyone who is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is a follower of FK Kukësi.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they are a follower of FK Kukësi.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: No follower of FK Kukësi is a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a follower of FK Kukësi, then they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. This involves checking if the premises lead to the conclusion without any additional assumptions.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that being a devotee of Legia Warszawa implies being a follower of FK Kukësi.\n- From the second premise, we know that being a follower of FK Kukësi implies not being a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n- Therefore, if someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, they must be a follower of FK Kukësi, and consequently, they cannot be a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\n\nThis is a classic example of a syllogism, where the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The structure is as follows:\n\n- If A (devotee of Legia Warszawa), then B (follower of FK Kukësi).\n- If B (follower of FK Kukësi), then not C (not a friend of Olympique de Marseille).\n- Therefore, if A (devotee of Legia Warszawa), then not C (not a friend of Olympique de Marseille).\n\nThis is a valid logical deduction. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
