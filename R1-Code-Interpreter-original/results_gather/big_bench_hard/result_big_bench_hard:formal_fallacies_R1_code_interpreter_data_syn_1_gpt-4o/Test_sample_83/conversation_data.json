    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an owner of a Lever soap or not being a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n3. **Conclusion**: Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\nLet's break down the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 2, we can express it in logical terms:\n  - Let \\( L \\) be \"Jonathan is an owner of a Lever soap.\"\n  - Let \\( \\neg E \\) be \"Jonathan is not a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap.\"\n  - Let \\( H \\) be \"Jonathan is a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\"\n\n  The premise can be expressed as: \\( L \\lor \\neg E \\rightarrow H \\).\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap, which means \\( E \\) is true. Therefore, \\( \\neg E \\) is false.\n\n- Given \\( \\neg E \\) is false, for the implication \\( L \\lor \\neg E \\rightarrow H \\) to be true, \\( L \\) must be true for \\( H \\) to be true. If \\( L \\) is false, then \\( H \\) must be false.\n\n- The conclusion states that Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo, which means \\( \\neg H \\) is true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the logical consistency:\n\n- If \\( \\neg H \\) is true, then \\( L \\lor \\neg E \\) must be false for the implication to hold true.\n- Since \\( \\neg E \\) is false, \\( L \\) must also be false for \\( L \\lor \\neg E \\) to be false.\n\nThus, the premises logically lead to the conclusion that Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo, given that he is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap and not an owner of a Lever soap.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
