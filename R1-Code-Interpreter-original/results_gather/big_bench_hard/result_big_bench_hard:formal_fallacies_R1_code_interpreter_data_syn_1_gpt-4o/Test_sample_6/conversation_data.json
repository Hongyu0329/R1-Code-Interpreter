The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Every ingredient of Sahara Saphire is both an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and an ingredient of Brushless Mascara. Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap. Therefore, Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Every ingredient of Sahara Saphire is both an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and an ingredient of Brushless Mascara.\n2. Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The first premise states that if something is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire, then it must also be an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and Brushless Mascara. This is a conditional statement about the ingredients of Sahara Saphire.\n- The second premise states that Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap.\n\nThe conclusion claims that Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire. However, the premises do not provide any information that directly links Cocamide to Sahara Saphire. The first premise only states a condition for ingredients of Sahara Saphire, but it does not state that all ingredients of Pink Lotion Soap are ingredients of Sahara Saphire. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion is not necessarily true given the premises. The premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
