    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Every schoolmate of Jeffery is a grandson of Todd.\n2. Whoever is a schoolmate of Jeffery is at least one of these: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern.\n3. Every schoolmate of Jeffery is an uncle of Lavern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Everyone who is a schoolmate of Jeffery is a brother of Kenneth, too.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that every schoolmate of Jeffery is a grandson of Todd.\n- Premise 2 states that every schoolmate of Jeffery is at least one of the following: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern. Since Premise 1 already establishes that every schoolmate is a grandson of Todd, this condition is satisfied.\n- Premise 3 states that every schoolmate of Jeffery is an uncle of Lavern.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"Everyone who is a schoolmate of Jeffery is a brother of Kenneth, too.\"\n\n- The premises do not provide any information that directly links being a grandson of Todd or being an uncle of Lavern to being a brother of Kenneth.\n- The premises only establish that schoolmates of Jeffery are grandsons of Todd and uncles of Lavern, but they do not establish that they are brothers of Kenneth.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that every schoolmate of Jeffery is a brother of Kenneth does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion is not necessarily true given the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
