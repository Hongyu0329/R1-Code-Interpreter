    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No stepbrother of Bryan is both a nephew of Wilburn and a son of Howard.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is not a son of Howard is a son of Adrian.\n3. **Premise 3**: Nobody is neither a nephew of Wilburn nor a son of Adrian.\n\n**Conclusion**: Everyone who is a stepbrother of Bryan is a son of Adrian.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that a stepbrother of Bryan cannot be both a nephew of Wilburn and a son of Howard. This implies that if a stepbrother of Bryan is a nephew of Wilburn, he cannot be a son of Howard.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is not a son of Howard, they must be a son of Adrian.\n- From Premise 3, everyone must be either a nephew of Wilburn or a son of Adrian.\n\nNow, let's consider the stepbrothers of Bryan:\n- If a stepbrother of Bryan is a nephew of Wilburn, by Premise 1, he cannot be a son of Howard, so by Premise 2, he must be a son of Adrian.\n- If a stepbrother of Bryan is not a nephew of Wilburn, by Premise 3, he must be a son of Adrian.\n\nIn both cases, the stepbrother of Bryan ends up being a son of Adrian. Therefore, the conclusion that every stepbrother of Bryan is a son of Adrian logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
