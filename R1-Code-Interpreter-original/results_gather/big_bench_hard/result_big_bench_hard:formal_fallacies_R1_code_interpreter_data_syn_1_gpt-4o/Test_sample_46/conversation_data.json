    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No half-sister of Nelda is a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\n2. **Premise 2**: It is false that Gretchen is a close friend of Terrie.\n3. **Premise 3**: It is false that Gretchen is a cousin of Amanda.\n4. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Gretchen is a half-sister of Nelda.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a half-sister of Nelda, then they cannot be a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\n- Premise 2 and Premise 3 state that Gretchen is neither a close friend of Terrie nor a cousin of Amanda.\n- The conclusion states that Gretchen is not a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- If Gretchen were a half-sister of Nelda, then according to Premise 1, she could not be a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda. \n- Since Premise 2 and Premise 3 confirm that Gretchen is neither a close friend of Terrie nor a cousin of Amanda, this is consistent with her being a half-sister of Nelda.\n- However, the conclusion states that Gretchen is not a half-sister of Nelda, which does not necessarily follow from the premises. The premises do not provide information that would contradict Gretchen being a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
