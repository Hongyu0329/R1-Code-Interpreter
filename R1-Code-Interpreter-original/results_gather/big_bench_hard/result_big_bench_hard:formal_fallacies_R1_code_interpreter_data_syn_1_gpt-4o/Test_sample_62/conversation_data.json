    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Some regular consumer of AXE shampoo is not an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n2. Premise 2: Everyone who is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap is an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n3. Conclusion: Somebody is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know there exists at least one person who regularly consumes AXE shampoo and does not occasionally purchase Sexy Hair shampoo.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\nThe conclusion states that there is someone who is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap. \n\nTo see if this conclusion logically follows from the premises, consider the following:\n\n- If someone is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo (Premise 2).\n- However, Premise 1 states that there is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo who is not an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo. This person cannot be a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap because that would contradict Premise 2.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: there must be someone who is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
