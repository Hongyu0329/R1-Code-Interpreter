    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Whoever is not a rare consumer of Lever soap is an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n2. There exists an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who is not an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap or not an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSome rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n### Logical Analysis:\n- **Premise 1**: This can be interpreted as a conditional statement: If a person is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, then they are an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n- **Premise 2**: This states that there is at least one person who is an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo and is not an occasional purchaser of either Paul Mitchell soap or Zest soap (or both).\n\n### Conclusion Analysis:\n- The conclusion claims that there exists some rare consumer of Lever soap who is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n1. From Premise 1, if someone is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, they must be an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n2. From Premise 2, there is at least one infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who is not an occasional purchaser of either Paul Mitchell soap or Zest soap.\n3. The conclusion needs to establish that some rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The premises do not provide a direct link between rare consumers of Lever soap and their purchasing habits of Paul Mitchell or Zest soap. The premises only establish a relationship between infrequent users of TRESemmé shampoo and their purchasing habits of Paul Mitchell or Zest soap. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
