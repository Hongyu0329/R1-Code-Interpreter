Second, every fan of FC Utrecht is not an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or not an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every opponent to FC Mariupol is an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, then they are an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every fan of FC Utrecht is not an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or not an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a fan of FC Utrecht, then they are not an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or not an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an opponent to FC Mariupol is sufficient for not being a fan of FC Utrecht.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, then they are not a fan of FC Utrecht.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, they must be an ex-supporter of either Hertha BSC Berlin or Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a fan of FC Utrecht, they cannot be an ex-supporter of both Hertha BSC Berlin and Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, they must be an ex-supporter of at least one of the two clubs (Hertha BSC Berlin or Bayer 04 Leverkusen).\n- If they are an ex-supporter of at least one of these clubs, they cannot be a fan of FC Utrecht (because being a fan of FC Utrecht requires not being an ex-supporter of both clubs).\n\nThus, if someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, they cannot be a fan of FC Utrecht, which means the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
