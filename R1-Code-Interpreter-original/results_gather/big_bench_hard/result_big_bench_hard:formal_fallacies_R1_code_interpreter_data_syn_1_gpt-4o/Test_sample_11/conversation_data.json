    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap is necessary for being an owner of a Lever soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an owner of a Lever soap, then they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n   - Symbolically: \\( L \\rightarrow N \\)\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is sufficient for being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, then they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n   - Symbolically: \\( A \\rightarrow N \\)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is an owner of a Lever soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, then they are an owner of a Lever soap.\n   - Symbolically: \\( A \\rightarrow L \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. We can use symbolic logic to analyze this:\n\n- From Premise 2 (\\( A \\rightarrow N \\)), we know that if someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n- From Premise 1 (\\( L \\rightarrow N \\)), we know that being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap is necessary for being an owner of a Lever soap, but it does not imply that being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap guarantees being an owner of a Lever soap.\n\nThe conclusion (\\( A \\rightarrow L \\)) requires that every infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is an owner of a Lever soap. However, the premises do not provide a direct link from \\( A \\) to \\( L \\) without additional assumptions. The premises only establish that \\( A \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( L \\rightarrow N \\), but not \\( A \\rightarrow L \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not deductively valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
