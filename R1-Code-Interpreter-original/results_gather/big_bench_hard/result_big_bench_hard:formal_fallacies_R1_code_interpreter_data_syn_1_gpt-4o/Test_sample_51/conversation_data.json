    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: It is false that Colleen is an ancestor of Cheryle.\n2. Premise 2: Whoever is a stepsister of Esther is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n3. Conclusion: It follows that it is false that Colleen is a stepsister of Esther.\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a stepsister of Esther, then they cannot be an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- Premise 1 states that Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- The conclusion states that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther.\n\nThe argument seems to be structured as a modus tollens:\n\n- If P, then Q (If someone is a stepsister of Esther, then they are not an ancestor of Cheryle).\n- Not Q (Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle).\n- Therefore, not P (Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther).\n\nThis is a valid form of argument. In modus tollens, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
