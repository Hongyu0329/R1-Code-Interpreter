    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is an ingredient of Eye Restore or an ingredient of 03 Bronzing Powder.\n2. **Premise 2**: No ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is an ingredient of 03 Bronzing Powder.\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is sufficient for being an ingredient of Eye Restore.\n\nLet's analyze the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that each ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 must be found in either Eye Restore or 03 Bronzing Powder.\n- Premise 2 tells us that none of the ingredients of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 are in 03 Bronzing Powder.\n- Therefore, the only option left for the ingredients of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is to be in Eye Restore.\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion logically follows. If every ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 must be in either Eye Restore or 03 Bronzing Powder, and none are in 03 Bronzing Powder, then they must all be in Eye Restore. Thus, being an ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is indeed sufficient for being an ingredient of Eye Restore.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
