    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne is an ancestor of Leslie.\n3. **Conclusion**: It is false that Darwin is an ancestor of Leslie.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne, then they are an ancestor of Leslie.\n- The conclusion states that Darwin is not an ancestor of Leslie.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n\n- According to Premise 2, for someone to not be an ancestor of Leslie, they must be both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne.\n- Since Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne (Premise 1), for the conclusion to hold (Darwin is not an ancestor of Leslie), Darwin must also be a half-brother of Alvin.\n\nThe argument is structured such that if Darwin is not an ancestor of Leslie, he must satisfy both conditions of being a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne. The premises do not provide information about Darwin being a half-brother of Alvin, so we cannot definitively conclude that Darwin is not an ancestor of Leslie based solely on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
