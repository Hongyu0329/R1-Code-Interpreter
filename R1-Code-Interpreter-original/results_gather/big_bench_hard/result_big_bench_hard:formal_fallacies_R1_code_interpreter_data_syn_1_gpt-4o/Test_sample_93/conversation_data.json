    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a friend of Kilmarnock FC is sufficient for not being an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a friend of Kilmarnock FC, then they are not an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - In logical terms: \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (where \\( F \\) is \"friend of Kilmarnock FC\" and \\( A \\) is \"admirer of The New Saints FC\").\n\n2. **Second Premise**: It is false that Maximo is an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: We may conclude that it is false that Maximo is a friend of Kilmarnock FC.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg F \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that if Maximo were a friend of Kilmarnock FC (\\( F \\)), then he would not be an admirer of The New Saints FC (\\( \\neg A \\)).\n- The second premise states that Maximo is not an admirer of The New Saints FC (\\( \\neg A \\)).\n- The conclusion claims that Maximo is not a friend of Kilmarnock FC (\\( \\neg F \\)).\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The first premise provides a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. The fact that Maximo is not an admirer of The New Saints FC (\\( \\neg A \\)) does not necessarily mean he cannot be a friend of Kilmarnock FC (\\( F \\)). The premises do not logically lead to the conclusion that Maximo is not a friend of Kilmarnock FC. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
