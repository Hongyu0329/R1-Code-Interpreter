    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Everyone who is a close friend of Glenna is a close friend of Tamara.\n2. Whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Glenna.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Whoever is none of this: a half-sister of Deborah or workmate of Nila, is a close friend of Tamara.\n\n### Logical Analysis:\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Glenna.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a close friend of Glenna, then they are a close friend of Tamara.\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can deduce:\n- If someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Glenna (Premise 2).\n- If they are a close friend of Glenna, then they are a close friend of Tamara (Premise 1).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n- Whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Tamara.\n\nThis means the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
