  "question": "\"Is Siri a stepsister of Mary? Is Susan related to Kate? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, no great-grandmother of Doreen is a half-sister of Kathy. Moreover, every great-grandmother of Doreen is a workmate of Inocencia or an ancestor of Wanda or a half-sister of Kathy. Finally, being a great-grandmother of Doreen is sufficient for not being a workmate of Inocencia. So, necessarily, every great-grandmother of Doreen is an ancestor of Wanda.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No great-grandmother of Doreen is a half-sister of Kathy.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every great-grandmother of Doreen is a workmate of Inocencia or an ancestor of Wanda or a half-sister of Kathy.\n3. **Premise 3**: Being a great-grandmother of Doreen is sufficient for not being a workmate of Inocencia.\n\n**Conclusion**: Every great-grandmother of Doreen is an ancestor of Wanda.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that no great-grandmother of Doreen can be a half-sister of Kathy.\n- From Premise 2, we know that every great-grandmother of Doreen must be one of the following: a workmate of Inocencia, an ancestor of Wanda, or a half-sister of Kathy.\n- From Premise 3, we know that if someone is a great-grandmother of Doreen, they cannot be a workmate of Inocencia.\n\nGiven these premises, we can deduce the following:\n- Since no great-grandmother of Doreen can be a half-sister of Kathy (Premise 1), and they cannot be a workmate of Inocencia (Premise 3), the only remaining option from Premise 2 is that they must be an ancestor of Wanda.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that every great-grandmother of Doreen is an ancestor of Wanda necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the given premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
