    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. Some classmate of Sherry is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n2. Being a schoolmate of Leonor is sufficient for being a half-sister of Peggy.\n3. Everyone who is a schoolmate of Leonor is a great-grandmother of Sophie, too.\n\nConclusion: There is somebody who is a classmate of Sherry and not a schoolmate of Leonor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the premises:\n\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, then they are a half-sister of Peggy.\n- Premise 3 states that if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, then they are also a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n\nFrom premises 2 and 3, we can deduce that if someone is a schoolmate of Leonor, they must be both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie.\n\n- Premise 1 states that some classmate of Sherry is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie. This implies that there exists at least one classmate of Sherry who does not satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nGiven that being a schoolmate of Leonor implies being both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie, the existence of a classmate of Sherry who is not both a half-sister of Peggy and a great-grandmother of Sophie implies that this classmate cannot be a schoolmate of Leonor.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that there is somebody who is a classmate of Sherry and not a schoolmate of Leonor logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
