    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every admirer of AEK Athens FC is an expert of Feyenoord.\n3. **Conclusion**: Jose is an expert of Feyenoord.\n\nA deductively valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC.\n- Premise 2 states that every admirer of AEK Athens FC is an expert of Feyenoord. This means that if someone is an admirer of AEK Athens FC, they are automatically an expert of Feyenoord.\n\nGiven these premises, if Jose is indeed an admirer of AEK Athens FC (Premise 1), then according to Premise 2, Jose must be an expert of Feyenoord. Therefore, the conclusion that Jose is an expert of Feyenoord logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
