    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: No son of Alexander who is an ancestor of Ahmed is a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n   - This means that if someone is both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed, then they cannot be a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: No great-grandfather of Ronny is an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n   - This conclusion is making a broader claim that if someone is a great-grandfather of Ronny, then they cannot be either an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\n- The premise states a specific condition: being both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed excludes being a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n- The conclusion, however, generalizes this to say that being a great-grandfather of Ronny excludes being either an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n\nThe conclusion is broader than the premise. The premise only excludes a specific combination (being both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed) from being a great-grandfather of Ronny. The conclusion, however, excludes any great-grandfather of Ronny from being either an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander, which is not directly supported by the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
