    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion logically.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Whoever is an expert of BSC Young Boys is not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n2. Whoever is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is not an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- No friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\n### Logical Analysis:\nLet's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If someone is an expert of BSC Young Boys, then they are not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n   - This can be written as: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) (where \\( E \\) is being an expert of BSC Young Boys, and \\( F \\) is being an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: If someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, then they are not an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n   - This can be written as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) (where \\( D \\) is being a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- We need to show that if someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, then they are not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n- This can be written as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg F \\).\n\n### Logical Deduction:\nUsing the premises, we can deduce the following:\n- From Premise 2 (\\( D \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)), if someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv (\\( D \\)), they cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys (\\( \\neg E \\)).\n- From Premise 1 (\\( E \\rightarrow \\neg F \\)), if someone is not an expert of BSC Young Boys (\\( \\neg E \\)), we cannot directly conclude anything about their status as an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié (\\( F \\)).\n\nThe premises do not provide a direct link from being a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv (\\( D \\)) to not being an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié (\\( \\neg F \\)). Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
