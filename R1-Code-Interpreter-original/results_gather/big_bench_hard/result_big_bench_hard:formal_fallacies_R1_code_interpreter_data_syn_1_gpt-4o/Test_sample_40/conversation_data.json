    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir or a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n3. **Conclusion**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a critic of FC Ufa, they must be a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n- Premise 2 expands on this by saying that every critic of FC Ufa is either a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir, a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva, or an expert of Randers FC.\n\nThe conclusion states that every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC. \n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- Premise 1 already states that every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir. \n- Premise 2 includes additional possibilities (critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or expert of Randers FC) but does not negate the requirement of being a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n\nThe conclusion, however, excludes the possibility of being just a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir without being a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC. This exclusion is not supported by the premises, as Premise 1 clearly states that being a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir is sufficient for being a critic of FC Ufa.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
