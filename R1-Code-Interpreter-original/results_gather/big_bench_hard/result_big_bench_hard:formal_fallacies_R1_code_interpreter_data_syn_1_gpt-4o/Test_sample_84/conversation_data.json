    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: Not being an ingredient of Pink Smoothie is sufficient for not being an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is not an ingredient of Pink Smoothie, then it is not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\n2. Premise 2: Everything that is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This means: If something is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER, then it is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\n3. Conclusion: Every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER, then it is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that all ingredients of ILLUMINIZING POWDER are also ingredients of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- Premise 1 states that if something is not an ingredient of Pink Smoothie, it cannot be an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- For the conclusion to be true, every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER must also be an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the premises logically lead to the conclusion. If we assume the premises are true, does the conclusion necessarily follow?\n\nLet's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is not an ingredient of Pink Smoothie, then by Premise 1, it cannot be an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- However, Premise 2 states that it must be an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- This creates a contradiction unless every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is indeed an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
