The following argument pertains to this question: First of all, every rare consumer of KMS shampoo who is an owner of a Aveeno shampoo is a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap or a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo. Next, no rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of a Aveeno shampoo. Therefore, every rare consumer of KMS shampoo who is an owner of a Aveeno shampoo is also a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every rare consumer of KMS shampoo who is an owner of Aveeno shampoo is a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap or a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and owns Aveeno shampoo, then they are either a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap or a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: No rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of Aveeno shampoo.\n\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap, then they are not both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of Aveeno shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every rare consumer of KMS shampoo who is an owner of Aveeno shampoo is also a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that a rare consumer of KMS shampoo who owns Aveeno shampoo must be either a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap or a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap cannot be both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of Aveeno shampoo.\n\n- Therefore, if someone is a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and owns Aveeno shampoo, they cannot be a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap (due to Premise 2). This leaves the only possibility that they must be a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
