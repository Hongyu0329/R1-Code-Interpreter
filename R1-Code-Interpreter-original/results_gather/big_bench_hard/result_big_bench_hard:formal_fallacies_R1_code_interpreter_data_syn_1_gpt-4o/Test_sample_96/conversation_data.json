    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Being an ingredient of Gorgeous is necessary for not being an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is not an ingredient of Gorgeous, then it is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg G(x) \\rightarrow B(x) \\)\n\n2. Something is not an ingredient of Gorgeous and, in addition, not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n   - This can be interpreted as: There exists an \\( x \\) such that \\( \\neg G(x) \\land (\\neg C(x) \\lor \\neg D(x)) \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There is something that is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow and not both an ingredient of Coverage Duo and an ingredient of Deternined.\n  - This can be interpreted as: There exists an \\( x \\) such that \\( B(x) \\land \\neg (C(x) \\land D(x)) \\).\n\n### Logical Analysis:\n- From premise 1, we have \\( \\neg G(x) \\rightarrow B(x) \\), which means if something is not an ingredient of Gorgeous, it must be an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\n- From premise 2, we have \\( \\neg G(x) \\land (\\neg C(x) \\lor \\neg D(x)) \\), which means there exists an \\( x \\) that is not an ingredient of Gorgeous and either not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n- Combining these, for the \\( x \\) that satisfies premise 2, \\( \\neg G(x) \\) implies \\( B(x) \\) (from premise 1).\n- Therefore, for this \\( x \\), \\( B(x) \\) is true, and \\( \\neg (C(x) \\land D(x)) \\) is also true because \\( \\neg C(x) \\lor \\neg D(x) \\) implies \\( \\neg (C(x) \\land D(x)) \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
