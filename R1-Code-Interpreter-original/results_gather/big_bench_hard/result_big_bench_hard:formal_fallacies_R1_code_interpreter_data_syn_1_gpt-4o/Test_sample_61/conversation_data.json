    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Every uncle of Harvey is not an ancestor of Adrian.\n2. Every uncle of Harvey is not a nephew of Ward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No nephew of Ward and no ancestor of Adrian is an uncle of Harvey.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From premise 1, we know that if someone is an uncle of Harvey, then they cannot be an ancestor of Adrian. This means that the set of uncles of Harvey and the set of ancestors of Adrian are disjoint.\n\n- From premise 2, we know that if someone is an uncle of Harvey, then they cannot be a nephew of Ward. This means that the set of uncles of Harvey and the set of nephews of Ward are disjoint.\n\n**Conclusion Analysis:**\n\n- The conclusion states that no nephew of Ward and no ancestor of Adrian is an uncle of Harvey. This is essentially saying that the intersection of the set of uncles of Harvey with the set of nephews of Ward and the set of ancestors of Adrian is empty.\n\n**Logical Deduction:**\n\n- Since the premises establish that the set of uncles of Harvey is disjoint from both the set of ancestors of Adrian and the set of nephews of Ward, the conclusion logically follows. The conclusion is essentially a restatement of the premises in a combined form.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
