    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion logically.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo.\n   - This means Oliver does not fall into the category of people who regularly use Organix Hair shampoo.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Everyone who is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap is a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - This premise can be broken down into a conditional statement:\n     - If a person is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap, then they are a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Oliver is a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n- From the first premise, we know Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo.\n- The second premise states that if someone is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap, then they are a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- Since Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo, he cannot be both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap.\n- Therefore, according to the second premise, Oliver must be a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
