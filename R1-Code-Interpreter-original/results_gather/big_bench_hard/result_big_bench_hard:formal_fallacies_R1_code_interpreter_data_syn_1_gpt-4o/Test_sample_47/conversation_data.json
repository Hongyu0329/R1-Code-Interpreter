    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n**Premise:**\n1. Every close friend of Myra is neither a cousin of Sue nor a daughter of Tommy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No cousin of Sue and no daughter of Tommy is a close friend of Myra.\n\n**Logical Analysis:**\n\nThe premise states that if someone is a close friend of Myra, then they cannot be a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy. This can be expressed in logical terms as:\n\n- If \\( F(x) \\) is \"x is a close friend of Myra,\" \\( C(x) \\) is \"x is a cousin of Sue,\" and \\( D(x) \\) is \"x is a daughter of Tommy,\" then the premise can be written as:\n  \\[\n  \\forall x (F(x) \\rightarrow \\neg C(x) \\land \\neg D(x))\n  \\]\n\nThe conclusion states that no cousin of Sue and no daughter of Tommy is a close friend of Myra. This can be expressed as:\n\n- \\[\n  \\forall x (\\neg C(x) \\land \\neg D(x) \\rightarrow \\neg F(x))\n  \\]\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In logical terms, we need to see if the premise implies the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that if someone is a close friend of Myra, they cannot be a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy. The conclusion states that if someone is a cousin of Sue or a daughter of Tommy, they cannot be a close friend of Myra. \n\nThe conclusion is essentially a contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
