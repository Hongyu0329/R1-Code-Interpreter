    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo is necessary for being a regular consumer of Yardley London soap.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, then they must be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n   - In logical terms: \\( Y \\rightarrow K \\) (where \\( Y \\) is being a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, and \\( K \\) is being a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is a regular user of Joico shampoo is not a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a regular user of Joico shampoo, then they are not a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n   - In logical terms: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg K \\) (where \\( J \\) is being a regular user of Joico shampoo).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: No regular consumer of Yardley London soap is a regular user of Joico shampoo.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, then they are not a regular user of Joico shampoo.\n   - In logical terms: \\( Y \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1 (\\( Y \\rightarrow K \\)), we know that if someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, they must be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n- From Premise 2 (\\( J \\rightarrow \\neg K \\)), we know that if someone is a regular user of Joico shampoo, they cannot be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n- To prove the conclusion (\\( Y \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)), we need to show that if someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, they cannot be a regular user of Joico shampoo.\n\nLet's use a logical deduction to see if the conclusion follows from the premises:\n\n- Assume \\( Y \\) (someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap).\n- From Premise 1, \\( Y \\rightarrow K \\), so \\( K \\) must be true (they are a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo).\n- If \\( K \\) is true, then from Premise 2, \\( J \\) must be false (since \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg K \\)).\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg J \\) is true, which means the conclusion \\( Y \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) holds.\n\nThe argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
