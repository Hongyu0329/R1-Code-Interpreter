    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ancestor of Christy is necessary for being a daughter of Denise.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a daughter of Denise, then they are an ancestor of Christy.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\rightarrow \\text{Ancestor of Christy} \\)\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Not being a cousin of Maryann is sufficient for not being an ancestor of Christy.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a cousin of Maryann, then they are not an ancestor of Christy.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Ancestor of Christy} \\)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a daughter of Denise is a cousin of Maryann.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a daughter of Denise, then they are a cousin of Maryann.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\rightarrow \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\)\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: \\( \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\rightarrow \\text{Ancestor of Christy} \\)\n- From Premise 2, we have: \\( \\neg \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Ancestor of Christy} \\)\n\nWe need to determine if these premises logically lead to the conclusion: \\( \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\rightarrow \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\).\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of Premise 1:\n- Contrapositive of Premise 1: \\( \\neg \\text{Ancestor of Christy} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\)\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion:\n- From Premise 2: \\( \\neg \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Ancestor of Christy} \\)\n- From the contrapositive of Premise 1: \\( \\neg \\text{Ancestor of Christy} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\)\n\nBy combining these, we can derive:\n- \\( \\neg \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\)\n\nHowever, the conclusion we need is:\n- \\( \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\rightarrow \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\)\n\nThe derived statement \\( \\neg \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\) is not logically equivalent to the conclusion \\( \\neg \\text{Daughter of Denise} \\rightarrow \\text{Cousin of Maryann} \\). Therefore, the argument does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
