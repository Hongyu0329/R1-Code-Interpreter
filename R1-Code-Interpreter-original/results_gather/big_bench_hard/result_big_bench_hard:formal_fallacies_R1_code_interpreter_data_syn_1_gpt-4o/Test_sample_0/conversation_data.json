    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Whoever is a schoolmate of Sondra is not a stepsister of Pricilla.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a schoolmate of Sondra, then they are not a stepsister of Pricilla.\n   - In logical terms: \\( S(x) \\rightarrow \\neg P(x) \\), where \\( S(x) \\) means \"x is a schoolmate of Sondra\" and \\( P(x) \\) means \"x is a stepsister of Pricilla\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a stepsister of Pricilla is a schoolmate of Sondra.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is not a stepsister of Pricilla, then they are a schoolmate of Sondra.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\neg P(x) \\rightarrow S(x) \\).\n\nThe argument claims that the conclusion follows from the premise. To check the validity, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not imply \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). This is a common logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" The correct logical equivalence is the contrapositive: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is equivalent to \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nLet's check if the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise:\n\n- Premise: \\( S(x) \\rightarrow \\neg P(x) \\)\n- Contrapositive of the premise: \\( P(x) \\rightarrow \\neg S(x) \\)\n\nThe conclusion \\( \\neg P(x) \\rightarrow S(x) \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, making the argument invalid.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
