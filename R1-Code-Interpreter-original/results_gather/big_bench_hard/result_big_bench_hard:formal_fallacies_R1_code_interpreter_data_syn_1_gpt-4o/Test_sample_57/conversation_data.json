    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig is necessary for being an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB, then X is an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Not being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is sufficient for not being an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is not an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder, then X is not an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is necessary for being an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB, then X is an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: FACIAL SCRUB → Eye Definer Twig\n- From Premise 2, we have: ¬NARS Pressed Powder → ¬Eye Definer Twig\n\nWe need to determine if these premises logically lead to the conclusion: FACIAL SCRUB → NARS Pressed Powder.\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 2, ¬NARS Pressed Powder → ¬Eye Definer Twig can be contrapositively rewritten as: Eye Definer Twig → NARS Pressed Powder.\n- Now, combining this with Premise 1: FACIAL SCRUB → Eye Definer Twig and Eye Definer Twig → NARS Pressed Powder, we can deduce: FACIAL SCRUB → NARS Pressed Powder.\n\nThus, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
