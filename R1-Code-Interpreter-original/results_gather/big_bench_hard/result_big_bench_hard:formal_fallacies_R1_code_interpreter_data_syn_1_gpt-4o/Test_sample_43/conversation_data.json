  "question": "\"Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: No member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is a follower of OGC Nice. Whoever is a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is not a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC. Every member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC or a backer of FC Zenit or a follower of OGC Nice. Therefore, being a backer of FC Zenit is necessary for being a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. No member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is a follower of OGC Nice.\n2. Whoever is a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is not a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC.\n3. Every member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava is a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC or a backer of FC Zenit or a follower of OGC Nice.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Being a backer of FC Zenit is necessary for being a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From Premise 1, we know that no member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava can be a follower of OGC Nice.\n- From Premise 2, we know that no member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava can be a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC.\n- Premise 3 states that every member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava must be one of the following: a devotee of Royal Antwerp FC, a backer of FC Zenit, or a follower of OGC Nice.\n\nGiven Premises 1 and 2, members of ŠK Slovan Bratislava cannot be followers of OGC Nice or devotees of Royal Antwerp FC. Therefore, the only remaining option from Premise 3 is that they must be backers of FC Zenit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe argument is deductively valid because, based on the premises, being a backer of FC Zenit is indeed necessary for being a member of ŠK Slovan Bratislava. The premises logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
