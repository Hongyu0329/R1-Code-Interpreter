    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: \"Whoever is a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy is not a great-grandmother of Jaime.\"\n\n   This premise establishes a condition: If someone is both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy, then they cannot be a great-grandmother of Jaime.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: \"Everyone who is not a great-grandmother of Jaime is however a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\"\n\n   The conclusion suggests that if someone is not a great-grandmother of Jaime, then they must be a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\n- The premise provides a specific condition: being both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy excludes being a great-grandmother of Jaime.\n- The conclusion, however, makes a broader claim: anyone who is not a great-grandmother of Jaime must fulfill both conditions (being a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy).\n\nThe conclusion attempts to reverse the conditional relationship established in the premise. The premise does not imply that the only way to not be a great-grandmother of Jaime is to be both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy. There could be other reasons or conditions for not being a great-grandmother of Jaime.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
