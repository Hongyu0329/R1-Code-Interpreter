    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Whoever is not a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo is not a rare consumer of South of France soap or not a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not Regular(Pantene), then not Rare(South of France) or not Rare(Kiss My Face).\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Being a rare consumer of South of France soap is necessary for not being a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not Rare(South of France), then Frequent(Proactiv).\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap nor a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not Frequent(Proactiv), then Rare(Kiss My Face).\n\n**Conclusion**: Whoever is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap is a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not Frequent(Proactiv), then Regular(Pantene).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the third premise, if someone is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv, they must be a rare consumer of Kiss My Face.\n- From the first premise, if someone is not a regular consumer of Pantene, they must either not be a rare consumer of South of France or not be a rare consumer of Kiss My Face.\n- From the second premise, if someone is not a rare consumer of South of France, they must be a frequent consumer of Proactiv.\n\nLet's see if we can derive the conclusion from these premises using logical reasoning:\n\n1. Assume someone is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv.\n2. From the third premise, they must be a rare consumer of Kiss My Face.\n3. From the first premise, if they are not a regular consumer of Pantene, they must either not be a rare consumer of South of France or not be a rare consumer of Kiss My Face.\n4. Since they are a rare consumer of Kiss My Face (from step 2), the only way the first premise holds is if they are not a rare consumer of South of France.\n5. From the second premise, if they are not a rare consumer of South of France, they must be a frequent consumer of Proactiv, which contradicts our assumption in step 1.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that they are not a regular consumer of Pantene leads to a contradiction. Hence, they must be a regular consumer of Pantene.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
