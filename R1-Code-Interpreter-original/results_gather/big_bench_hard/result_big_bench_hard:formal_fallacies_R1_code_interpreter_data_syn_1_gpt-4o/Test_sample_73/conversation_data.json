    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ex-fan of Villarreal CF is necessary for being a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, then they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n   - In logical terms: If \\( M \\) (member of SK Rapid Wien), then \\( E \\) (ex-fan of Villarreal CF). This is \\( M \\rightarrow E \\).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Some supporter of Östersunds FK is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n   - This can be interpreted as: There exists at least one person who is a supporter of Östersunds FK and is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n   - In logical terms: There exists \\( x \\) such that \\( S(x) \\) (supporter of Östersunds FK) and \\( \\neg E(x) \\) (not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Somebody is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n   - In logical terms: There exists \\( x \\) such that \\( S(x) \\) and \\( \\neg M(x) \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF (\\( M \\rightarrow E \\)).\n- From Premise 2, we know there exists a person who is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF (\\( \\exists x (S(x) \\land \\neg E(x)) \\)).\n\nTo reach the conclusion that there exists someone who is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not a member of SK Rapid Wien (\\( \\exists x (S(x) \\land \\neg M(x)) \\)), we can use the following reasoning:\n\n- From Premise 2, we have \\( \\exists x (S(x) \\land \\neg E(x)) \\).\n- If \\( \\neg E(x) \\) is true for some \\( x \\), then \\( M(x) \\) cannot be true for that \\( x \\) because \\( M \\rightarrow E \\) implies \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n- Therefore, for that \\( x \\), \\( \\neg M(x) \\) must be true.\n- Hence, \\( \\exists x (S(x) \\land \\neg M(x)) \\) is true.\n\nThe argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
