    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Every opponent to AS Roma is a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin or a fan of AC Sparta Praha or not a fan of FCSB.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an opponent to AS Roma, then they are either a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, a fan of AC Sparta Praha, or not a fan of FCSB.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: No fan of FCSB is an expert of FK Sūduva.\n   - This means: If someone is a fan of FCSB, then they are not an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Every fan of AC Sparta Praha is an expert of FK Sūduva.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a fan of AC Sparta Praha, then they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n4. **Fourth Premise**: Being an expert of FK Sūduva is necessary for being a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin.\n   - This means: If someone is a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, then they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n**Conclusion**: Being an expert of FK Sūduva is necessary for being an opponent to AS Roma.\n   - This means: If someone is an opponent to AS Roma, then they must be an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, an opponent to AS Roma must be either a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, a fan of AC Sparta Praha, or not a fan of FCSB.\n- From the second premise, if they are not a fan of FCSB, it doesn't provide any information about being an expert of FK Sūduva.\n- From the third premise, if they are a fan of AC Sparta Praha, they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n- From the fourth premise, if they are a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\nThus, in all cases (either being a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin or a fan of AC Sparta Praha), the opponent to AS Roma must be an expert of FK Sūduva. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
