    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every fan of FC Lugano is neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a fan of FC Lugano, then they are not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva or ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, is a fan of FC Lugano.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, then they are a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nThe argument can be analyzed using logical implications:\n\n- The premise states: \\( \\text{Fan of FC Lugano} \\rightarrow (\\neg \\text{Devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva} \\land \\neg \\text{Ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem}) \\)\n- The conclusion states: \\( (\\neg \\text{Devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva} \\land \\neg \\text{Ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem}) \\rightarrow \\text{Fan of FC Lugano} \\)\n\nThe premise provides a necessary condition for being a fan of FC Lugano, while the conclusion claims that this condition is also sufficient. For the argument to be valid, the premise must logically lead to the conclusion.\n\nLet's check the logical equivalence of these statements using Python code to ensure the argument's validity.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.logic.boolalg import Implies\nfrom sympy.abc import A, B, C\n\n# A: Fan of FC Lugano\n# B: Devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva\n# C: Ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem\n\n# Premise: A -> (not B and not C)\npremise = Implies(A, ~B & ~C)\n\n# Conclusion: (not B and not C) -> A\nconclusion = Implies(~B & ~C, A)\n\n# Check if the premise implies the conclusion\nis_valid = Implies(premise, conclusion).simplify()\n\nprint(is_valid)\n```\n\nThe code will determine if the logical implication from the premise to the conclusion holds true. If it does, the argument is valid; otherwise, it is invalid. Let's execute the code to find out.",
    "The code output indicates that the logical implication check did not return a simple boolean value, which suggests that the argument is not valid as structured. Let's analyze the logical structure again:\n\n1. **Premise**: If someone is a fan of FC Lugano, then they are neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n2. **Conclusion**: If someone is neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, then they are a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nThe premise provides a necessary condition for being a fan of FC Lugano, but the conclusion incorrectly assumes that this condition is also sufficient. This is a classic logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because all fans of FC Lugano meet a certain condition does not mean that everyone who meets that condition is a fan of FC Lugano.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
