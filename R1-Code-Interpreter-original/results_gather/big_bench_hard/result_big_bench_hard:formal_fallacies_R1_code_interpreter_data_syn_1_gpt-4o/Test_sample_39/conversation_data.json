  "question": "\"Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.\n   - This means if someone is a brother of Edward, then they must be a nephew of Henry.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is both an ancestor of Carlos and a nephew of Henry, and this person is also a workmate of Efrain.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.\n   - This means if someone is a brother of Edward, then they are definitely a workmate of Efrain.\n\n**Conclusion**: Somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that if someone is a brother of Edward, they must be a nephew of Henry.\n- From the third premise, we know that if someone is a brother of Edward, they are a workmate of Efrain.\n- The second premise tells us that there is an ancestor of Carlos who is both a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.\n\nTo satisfy the conclusion, we need to find a person who is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward. \n\n- The second premise provides us with an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.\n- The first and third premises together imply that if someone is a brother of Edward, they must be both a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.\n\nThus, the person described in the second premise (an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain) could potentially be a brother of Edward, satisfying the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
