    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. No member of Juventus is an expert of Getafe CF.\n2. Somebody is a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Not every follower of West Ham United FC is a member of Juventus.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Premise 1** states that if someone is a member of Juventus, they cannot be an expert of Getafe CF.\n- **Premise 2** introduces a person who is both a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce:\n- The person mentioned in Premise 2 cannot be a member of Juventus because they are an expert of Getafe CF, which contradicts Premise 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The conclusion states that not every follower of West Ham United FC is a member of Juventus. This is supported by the premises because we have identified at least one follower of West Ham United FC (the person in Premise 2) who cannot be a member of Juventus due to their expertise in Getafe CF.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
