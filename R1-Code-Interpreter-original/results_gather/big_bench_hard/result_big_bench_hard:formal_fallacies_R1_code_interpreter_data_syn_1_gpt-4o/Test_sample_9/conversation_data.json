    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a grandson of Dominic is a workmate of James.\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan is a grandson of Dominic.\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a son of Cody or son of Ivan, is a workmate of James.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, then they are a grandson of Dominic.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a grandson of Dominic, then they are a workmate of James.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows from these premises:\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, then they are a workmate of James.\n- This is a direct application of the premises: \n  - If someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, by Premise 2, they are a grandson of Dominic.\n  - If they are a grandson of Dominic, by Premise 1, they are a workmate of James.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
