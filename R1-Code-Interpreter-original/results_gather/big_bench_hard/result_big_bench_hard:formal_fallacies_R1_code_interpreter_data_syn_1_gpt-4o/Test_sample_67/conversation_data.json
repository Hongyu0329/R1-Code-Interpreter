    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Nobody is neither an ancestor of Alvin nor a workmate of Tony.\n2. Whoever is a schoolmate of Keith is not an ancestor of Alvin.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Everyone who is a schoolmate of Keith is a workmate of Tony.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Premise 1** implies that if someone is not an ancestor of Alvin, they must be a workmate of Tony. This can be rewritten as: If not an ancestor of Alvin, then a workmate of Tony.\n- **Premise 2** states that if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they are not an ancestor of Alvin.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\nFrom Premise 2, we know that schoolmates of Keith are not ancestors of Alvin. According to Premise 1, if someone is not an ancestor of Alvin, they must be a workmate of Tony. Therefore, schoolmates of Keith, who are not ancestors of Alvin, must be workmates of Tony.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
