Every ex-fan of FC Sion is not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor. Being an admirer of FC Krasnodar is necessary for being an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every expert of AS Saint-Étienne is an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an expert of AS Saint-Étienne, then they are an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ex-fan of FC Sion is not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, then they are either not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Being an admirer of FC Krasnodar is necessary for being an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, then they are an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Being an ex-fan of FC Sion is sufficient for being an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, then they are an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, they are either not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n- If they are not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne, Premise 1 does not apply to them.\n- If they are not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, Premise 3 does not apply to them.\n- However, if they are an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, then by Premise 3, they must be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\nThe conclusion states that being an ex-fan of FC Sion is sufficient for being an admirer of FC Krasnodar. For this to be true, every ex-fan of FC Sion must be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\nLet's check if this is logically consistent with the premises:\n\n- If an ex-fan of FC Sion is not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, Premise 3 does not apply, and they may not necessarily be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n- Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, as there is a possibility that an ex-fan of FC Sion is not an admirer of FC Krasnodar if they are not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
