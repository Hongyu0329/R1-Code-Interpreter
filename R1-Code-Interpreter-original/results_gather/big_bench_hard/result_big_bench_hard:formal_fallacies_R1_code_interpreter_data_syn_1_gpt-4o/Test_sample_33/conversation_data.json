    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Whatever is an ingredient of Vertica Rush and an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Every ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.\n\n### Logical Analysis:\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n- Premise: If something is an ingredient of both Vertica Rush and Liqua Versa Gel, then it is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n- Conclusion: If something is an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad, then it is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.\n\nThis is a classic example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and both are logically equivalent.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Original statement: If (A and B), then not C.\n- Contrapositive: If C, then (not A or not B).\n\nThe conclusion is indeed the contrapositive of the premise, which means the argument is deductively valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
