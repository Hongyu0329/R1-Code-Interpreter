    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion logically.\n\n1. **First Premise**: It is not the case that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Nobility.\n   - This means Propylene oxide is not in Nobility.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: It is false that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core.\n   - This means Propylene oxide is not in Cover Pink, Core.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is neither an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core nor an ingredient of Nobility.\n   - This means that if something is an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry, it cannot be an ingredient of either Cover Pink, Core or Nobility.\n\n**Conclusion**: Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- From the third premise, we know that any ingredient of Charged Up Cherry cannot be in Cover Pink, Core or Nobility.\n- Since Propylene oxide is not in Cover Pink, Core (second premise) and not in Nobility (first premise), it satisfies the condition of the third premise.\n- However, the third premise does not state that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry; it only states a condition for ingredients of Charged Up Cherry.\n- The conclusion that Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry does not necessarily follow from the premises because the premises do not provide information about whether Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry or not.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
