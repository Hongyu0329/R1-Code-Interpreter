Next, being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ. Plus,being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: Some backer of BSC Young Boys is a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n2. Premise 2: Being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n3. Premise 3: Being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n4. Conclusion: There is somebody who is a backer of BSC Young Boys and an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, then they are a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n- From Premise 3, we know that if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, then they must be an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- Premise 1 states that there is a backer of BSC Young Boys who is both a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, we need to see if the existence of a backer of BSC Young Boys who is both a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen implies that this person is also an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nGiven Premise 3, being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor, but it does not imply that every expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is an ex-fan of NK Maribor. Therefore, the existence of a backer of BSC Young Boys who is an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen does not necessarily mean they are an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
