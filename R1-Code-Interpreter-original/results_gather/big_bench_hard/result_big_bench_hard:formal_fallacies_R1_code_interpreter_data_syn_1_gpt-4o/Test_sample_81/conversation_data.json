    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ex-fan of FC Bayern München is a follower of Rangers FC.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München, then they are a follower of Rangers FC.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a follower of Rangers FC is necessary for being a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, then they are a follower of Rangers FC.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is neither a member of FC Mariupol nor an expert of Stade Rennais FC is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is not a member of FC Mariupol and not an expert of Stade Rennais FC, then they are an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Not being a follower of Rangers FC is sufficient for being a member of FC Mariupol or not being an expert of Stade Rennais FC.\n   - This can be represented as: If someone is not a follower of Rangers FC, then they are a member of FC Mariupol or not an expert of Stade Rennais FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München, they must be a follower of Rangers FC.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, they must also be a follower of Rangers FC.\n- Premise 3 provides a condition under which someone is either an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, which implies they must be a follower of Rangers FC (from Premises 1 and 2).\n\nThe conclusion states that not being a follower of Rangers FC implies being a member of FC Mariupol or not being an expert of Stade Rennais FC. This is essentially the contrapositive of Premise 3, which states that if someone is not a member of FC Mariupol and not an expert of Stade Rennais FC, then they must be a follower of Rangers FC (since they must be either an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal).\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
