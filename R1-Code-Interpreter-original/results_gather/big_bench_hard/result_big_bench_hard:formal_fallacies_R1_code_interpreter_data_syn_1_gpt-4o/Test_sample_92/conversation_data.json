    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Nobody is neither an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap nor an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n   - This means that everyone is either an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap or an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap (or both).\n\n2. **Second Premise**: No owner of an Aveeno shampoo who is an infrequent user of Zest soap is an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n   - This means that if someone owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap, they cannot be an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is an owner of an Aveeno shampoo and an infrequent user of Zest soap is also an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\n   - This conclusion suggests that if someone owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that everyone must be an occasional purchaser of either Yardley London soap or Paul Mitchell soap.\n- From the second premise, we know that if someone owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap, they cannot be an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n- Therefore, the only option left for someone who owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap is to be an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
