    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Terry is a grandson of Ward.\n   - This means Terry is a male descendant of Ward, specifically the son of one of Ward's children.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Every grandson of Paul is an uncle of Earl and a grandson of Ward.\n   - This implies that if someone is a grandson of Paul, they must also be a grandson of Ward and an uncle of Earl.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Terry is a grandson of Paul.\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the logical structure:\n\n- From the second premise, we know that if someone is a grandson of Paul, they are also a grandson of Ward. However, the reverse is not necessarily true; being a grandson of Ward does not imply being a grandson of Paul unless additional information is provided.\n- The first premise only states that Terry is a grandson of Ward, but it does not provide any information about Terry's relationship to Paul.\n- The second premise does not state that all grandsons of Ward are grandsons of Paul, only that grandsons of Paul are also grandsons of Ward.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Terry is a grandson of Paul does not logically follow from the premises provided. The premises do not provide sufficient information to deduce that Terry is a grandson of Paul.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
