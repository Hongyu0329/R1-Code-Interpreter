    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap or a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n   - Let's denote:\n     - \\( P \\): Rare consumer of Pantene shampoo\n     - \\( H \\): Occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo\n     - \\( T \\): Frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap\n     - \\( M \\): Regular user of Mysore soap\n\n   - The premise can be expressed as: If \\( P \\land H \\), then \\( T \\lor M \\).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is neither a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If \\( T \\), then \\(\\neg P \\land \\neg H\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is not both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is however a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If \\(\\neg (P \\land H)\\), then \\( M \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: \\( P \\land H \\rightarrow T \\lor M \\).\n- From Premise 2, we have: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\land \\neg H \\).\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion \\(\\neg (P \\land H) \\rightarrow M\\) logically follows from these premises.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the contrapositive of Premise 1:\n- The contrapositive of \\( P \\land H \\rightarrow T \\lor M \\) is \\(\\neg (T \\lor M) \\rightarrow \\neg (P \\land H)\\).\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that if \\( T \\) is true, then both \\( P \\) and \\( H \\) must be false. Therefore, if \\( T \\) is true, \\( P \\land H \\) cannot be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the situation where \\(\\neg (P \\land H)\\) is true. This means that either \\( P \\) is false, \\( H \\) is false, or both are false. \n\n- If \\( P \\land H \\) is false, then the only way for Premise 1 to hold is if \\( M \\) is true, because \\( T \\) cannot be true without contradicting Premise 2.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\(\\neg (P \\land H) \\rightarrow M\\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
