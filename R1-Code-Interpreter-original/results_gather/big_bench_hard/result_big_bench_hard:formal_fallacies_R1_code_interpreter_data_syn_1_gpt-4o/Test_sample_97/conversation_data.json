    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap is necessary for being a regular user of Nag Champa soap.\n   - This implies: If someone is a regular user of Nag Champa soap, then they must be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is at least one of these: a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n   - This implies: If someone is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo, then they are either a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: No regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap is a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - This implies: If someone is a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, then they cannot be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n**Conclusion**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the second premise, a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo must be at least one of the following: a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n- If they are a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, the third premise tells us they cannot be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- If they are a regular user of Nag Champa soap, the first premise tells us they must be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap, which contradicts the conclusion.\n- If they are a regular user of René Furterer shampoo, the conclusion directly states they are not.\n\nThe conclusion states that a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo. However, the premises do not provide a logical path to exclude the possibility of being a regular user of René Furterer shampoo without being a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\nThus, the argument does not logically exclude all possibilities that would make the conclusion true based on the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
