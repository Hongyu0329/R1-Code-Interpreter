    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Being an ingredient of Peach Paint is sufficient for being an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n   - This means: If X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, then X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n\n2. Every ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or an ingredient of Calming Shampoo.\n   - This means: If X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, then X is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or X is an ingredient of Calming Shampoo.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Every ingredient of Peach Paint is an ingredient of Calming Shampoo or an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde.\n\n### Logical Analysis:\nLet's break down the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, then X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n- From Premise 2, if X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, then X is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or X is an ingredient of Calming Shampoo.\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can deduce:\n- If X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, then X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER (from Premise 1).\n- If X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, then X is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or X is an ingredient of Calming Shampoo (from Premise 2).\n\nTherefore, if X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, then X is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or X is an ingredient of Calming Shampoo.\n\nThis matches the conclusion. Thus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
