  "question": "\"Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, everyone who is both an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK is a follower of Liverpool FC, too. Second, being an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is sufficient for not being an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol. Third, whoever is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK. In consequence, every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is both an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK is a follower of Liverpool FC.\n   - This can be represented as: If a person is an opponent of Real Sociedad and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş, then they are a follower of Liverpool.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is sufficient for not being an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol.\n   - This can be represented as: If a person is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski, then they are not an opponent of Real Sociedad.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK.\n   - This can be represented as: If a person is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski, then they are not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş.\n\n**Conclusion**: Every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone admires HŠK Zrinjski, they are not an opponent of Real Sociedad.\n- From Premise 3, if someone admires HŠK Zrinjski, they are not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş.\n- Therefore, an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski cannot satisfy both conditions of Premise 1 (being an opponent of Real Sociedad and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş) simultaneously.\n- Since Premise 1 requires both conditions to be true for someone to be a follower of Liverpool, and an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski cannot satisfy both conditions, Premise 1 does not apply to them.\n\nThe conclusion that every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC does not logically follow from the premises. The premises do not provide a direct link from being an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski to being a follower of Liverpool FC.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
