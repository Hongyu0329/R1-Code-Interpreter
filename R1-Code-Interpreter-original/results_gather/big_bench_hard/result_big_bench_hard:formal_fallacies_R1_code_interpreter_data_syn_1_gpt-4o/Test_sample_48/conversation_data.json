    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a niece of Shona is sufficient for not being a daughter of Hattie.\n3. **Conclusion**: Carmen is not a niece of Shona.\n\nLet's break down the premises and conclusion:\n\n- **Premise 1** establishes a fact about Carmen's relationship with Hattie.\n- **Premise 2** provides a conditional statement: If someone is a niece of Shona, then they cannot be a daughter of Hattie.\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the premises, the argument concludes that Carmen is not a niece of Shona.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 1, we know Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a niece of Shona, they cannot be a daughter of Hattie.\n- Therefore, if Carmen were a niece of Shona, it would contradict Premise 1, because she is a daughter of Hattie.\n\nThe conclusion that Carmen is not a niece of Shona logically follows from the premises because it avoids the contradiction that would arise if Carmen were both a daughter of Hattie and a niece of Shona.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
