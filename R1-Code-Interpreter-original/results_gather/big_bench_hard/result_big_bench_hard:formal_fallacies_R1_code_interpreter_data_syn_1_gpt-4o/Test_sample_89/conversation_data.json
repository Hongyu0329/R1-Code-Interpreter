    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Justin is not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every great-grandfather of Reyes is an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Justin is a great-grandfather of Reyes.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a great-grandfather of Reyes, then they must be both an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\n- Premise 1 states that Justin is either not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn. This means Justin does not satisfy the condition required to be a great-grandfather of Reyes (as per Premise 2).\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion that Justin is not a great-grandfather of Reyes logically follows. If Justin were a great-grandfather of Reyes, he would have to be both an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn, which contradicts Premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
