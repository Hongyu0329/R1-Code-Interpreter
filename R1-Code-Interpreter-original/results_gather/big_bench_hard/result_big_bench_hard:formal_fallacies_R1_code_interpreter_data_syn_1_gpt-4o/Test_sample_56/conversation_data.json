    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal is not a son of Ronald.\n   - This can be expressed logically as: If someone is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal, then they are not a son of Ronald.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: It is false that Santo is a son of Ronald.\n   - This means Santo is not a son of Ronald.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Santo is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\n\nTo check for deductive validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal, they cannot be a son of Ronald.\n- From Premise 2, we know that Santo is not a son of Ronald.\n\nThe conclusion states that Santo is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal. For the argument to be valid, the conclusion must be the only possible explanation for Santo not being a son of Ronald, given the premises.\n\nHowever, Premise 1 only states a condition under which someone is not a son of Ronald. It does not state that being a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal is the only way to not be a son of Ronald. There could be other reasons why Santo is not a son of Ronald that are not covered by the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
