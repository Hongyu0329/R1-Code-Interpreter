    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No ex-supporter of Getafe CF is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n   - This means that if someone is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF, they cannot be a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Everyone who is a friend of R. Charleroi SC is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n   - This means that if someone is a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they must be a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n   - This suggests that if someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they must be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's break it down:\n\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they are a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- From Premise 1, if someone is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF, they cannot be a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they must be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises do not provide information about what happens if someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC. The premises only establish a relationship between being a friend of R. Charleroi SC and being a critic of Kilmarnock FC, and between being an ex-supporter of Getafe CF and not being a critic of Kilmarnock FC. There is no logical connection that forces someone who is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC to be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
