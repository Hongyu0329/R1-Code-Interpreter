    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi is a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n\n   Let's break this down:\n   - If a person is not a cousin of Valerie and not a classmate of Mitzi, then they must be either a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every close friend of Kathryn is a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n\n   This means:\n   - If a person is a close friend of Kathryn, then they must be either a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a cousin of Valerie or classmate of Mitzi, is a workmate of Anita.\n\n   This conclusion is essentially saying:\n   - If a person is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, then they must be a workmate of Anita.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, they must be a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a close friend of Kathryn, they must be a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie.\n- Therefore, if someone is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi, they cannot be a close friend of Kathryn (because that would make them a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie, contradicting the initial condition).\n- Hence, they must be a workmate of Anita.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
