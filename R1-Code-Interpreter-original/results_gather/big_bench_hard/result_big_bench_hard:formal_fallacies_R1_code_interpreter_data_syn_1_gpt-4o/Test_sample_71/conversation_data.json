    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: William is a devotee of AC Milan.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every devotee of AC Milan and every expert of Yeni Malatyaspor is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n3. **Conclusion**: William is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n\nA deductively valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Let's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that William is a devotee of AC Milan.\n- Premise 2 states that every devotee of AC Milan is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK. This means that if someone is a devotee of AC Milan, they must be an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n\nGiven these premises, if William is a devotee of AC Milan, then according to Premise 2, he must be an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
