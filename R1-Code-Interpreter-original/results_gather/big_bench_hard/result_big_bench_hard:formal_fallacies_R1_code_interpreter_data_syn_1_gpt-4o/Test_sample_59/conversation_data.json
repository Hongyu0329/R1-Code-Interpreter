  "question": "\"Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First of all, every loyal buyer of Tocca soap is an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap. Next, being a loyal buyer of Tocca soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo. Plus,some regular user of Lever soap is not an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap or not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo. We may conclude that not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every loyal buyer of Tocca soap is an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a loyal buyer of Tocca soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n3. **Premise 3**: Some regular user of Lever soap is not an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap or not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n4. **Conclusion**: Not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, they must be a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n- Premise 3 states that there exists at least one regular user of Lever soap who is either not an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap or not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n\nThe conclusion claims that not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap. \n\nLet's consider the logical implications:\n- If a regular user of Lever soap were a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, they would have to be both an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap and a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo (due to Premises 1 and 2).\n- However, Premise 3 provides a counterexample: there is at least one regular user of Lever soap who does not meet one or both of these conditions.\n\nThus, the conclusion that not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
