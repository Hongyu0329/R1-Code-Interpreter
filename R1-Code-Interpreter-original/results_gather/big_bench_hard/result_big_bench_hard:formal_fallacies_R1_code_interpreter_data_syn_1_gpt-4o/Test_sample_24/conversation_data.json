    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n   - This means that if someone is not a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\n2. Nobody is neither a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n   - This means that if someone is not a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\n3. Every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n   - This means that if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n\nConclusion:\n- Being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n\n- From premise 3, if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n- From premises 1 and 2, if someone is not a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap, and if they are not a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\nTherefore, if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo. If they are not, they must be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
