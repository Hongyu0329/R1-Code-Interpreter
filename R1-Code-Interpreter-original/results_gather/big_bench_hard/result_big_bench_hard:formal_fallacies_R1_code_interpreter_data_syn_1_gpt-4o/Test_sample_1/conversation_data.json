    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and the premises provided.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise: Being a cousin of Chris is sufficient for not being a son of Kermit.\n2. Conclusion: Whoever is not a son of Kermit is a cousin of Chris.\n\nLet's break down the premises and conclusion:\n\n- The premise states that if someone is a cousin of Chris, then they are not a son of Kermit. This can be represented as:\n  - If A (cousin of Chris), then not B (not a son of Kermit).\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a son of Kermit, then they are a cousin of Chris. This can be represented as:\n  - If not B (not a son of Kermit), then A (cousin of Chris).\n\nThe argument is attempting to reverse the implication from the premise. In logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a formal fallacy. The original premise does not logically support the conclusion because the conclusion reverses the direction of the implication.\n\nTo further clarify, let's consider a simple example:\n- Premise: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\n- Conclusion: If the ground is wet, then it is raining.\n\nThe conclusion is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., someone watering the garden).\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
