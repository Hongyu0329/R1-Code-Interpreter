    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the premises and see if they logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Aquablush is sufficient for being an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is an ingredient of Aquablush, then X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whatever is neither an ingredient of Stop and Stare nor an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or an ingredient of Aquablush.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is not an ingredient of Stop and Stare and X is not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, then X is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or X is an ingredient of Aquablush.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Everything that is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara, then X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n\n**Conclusion**: Whatever is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow is however an ingredient of Stop and Stare or an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This can be represented as: If X is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow, then X is an ingredient of Stop and Stare or X is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 3, we know that if X is an ingredient of Aquablush or Lash Tinsel Mascara, then X is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n- From Premise 2, if X is not an ingredient of Stop and Stare and not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, then X must be an ingredient of either Lash Tinsel Mascara or Aquablush, which means X would be an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow (from Premise 1 and 3).\n- Therefore, if X is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow, it cannot be an ingredient of Aquablush or Lash Tinsel Mascara, which implies that X must be an ingredient of Stop and Stare or A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid. \n\n<<<valid>>>"
