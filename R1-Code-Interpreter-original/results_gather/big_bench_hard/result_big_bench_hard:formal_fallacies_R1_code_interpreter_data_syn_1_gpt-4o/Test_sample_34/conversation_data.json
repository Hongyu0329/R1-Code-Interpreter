    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: If someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, then that person is not a backer of FC Augsburg or not a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬Feyenoord → (¬Augsburg ∨ ¬Monaco)\n\n2. Premise 2: Being a devotee of AS Monaco FC is necessary for not being a member of AC Milan.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬Milan → Monaco\n\n3. Premise 3: Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a backer of FC Augsburg.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬(¬Milan ∧ ¬Augsburg) or equivalently: Milan ∨ Augsburg\n\n4. Conclusion: Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a follower of Feyenoord.\n   - This can be expressed as: ¬(¬Milan ∧ ¬Feyenoord) or equivalently: Milan ∨ Feyenoord\n\nNow, let's analyze whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. We can use logical reasoning to check if the premises lead to the conclusion.\n\n- From Premise 3 (Milan ∨ Augsburg), we know that at least one of Milan or Augsburg must be true for any person.\n- From Premise 2 (¬Milan → Monaco), if someone is not a member of Milan, they must be a devotee of Monaco.\n- From Premise 1 (¬Feyenoord → (¬Augsburg ∨ ¬Monaco)), if someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, then they are either not a backer of Augsburg or not a devotee of Monaco.\n\nLet's consider the possible cases:\n\n- If someone is a member of Milan, the conclusion (Milan ∨ Feyenoord) is satisfied.\n- If someone is not a member of Milan, then by Premise 2, they must be a devotee of Monaco.\n- If they are a devotee of Monaco, then by Premise 1, if they are not a follower of Feyenoord, they must not be a backer of Augsburg.\n- However, by Premise 3, they must be either a member of Milan or a backer of Augsburg. Since they are not a member of Milan, they must be a backer of Augsburg.\n- Therefore, if they are a backer of Augsburg, the condition in Premise 1 (¬Augsburg ∨ ¬Monaco) is not satisfied unless they are a follower of Feyenoord.\n\nThus, in all cases, the conclusion (Milan ∨ Feyenoord) holds true. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
