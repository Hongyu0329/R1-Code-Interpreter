The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, it is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo. Second, everything that is an ingredient of Chickadee is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo, too. So, necessarily, it is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Chickadee.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: It is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n   - This means Coffee bean extract is not in Go 365 Shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Everything that is an ingredient of Chickadee is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n   - This means if something is in Chickadee, it must also be in Go 365 Shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Chickadee.\n   - This means Coffee bean extract is not in Chickadee.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 2, if Coffee bean extract were an ingredient of Chickadee, it would also have to be an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n- However, Premise 1 states that Coffee bean extract is not an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n- Therefore, it must be the case that Coffee bean extract is not an ingredient of Chickadee, because if it were, it would contradict Premise 1.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
