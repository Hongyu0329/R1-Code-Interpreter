The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a cousin of Lawrence is sufficient for being a schoolmate of Kenneth.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Being a cousin of Lawrence is sufficient for being a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a cousin of Lawrence, then they are a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - In logical terms: \\( C(L) \\rightarrow S(K) \\)\n\n2. Somebody is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This can be expressed as: There exists a person who is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - In logical terms: \\( \\exists x (F(x, P) \\land \\neg S(x, K)) \\)\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence.\n  - In logical terms: \\( \\neg \\forall x (F(x, P) \\rightarrow C(x, L)) \\)\n\n### Analysis:\n- From premise 1, we know that if someone is a cousin of Lawrence, they must be a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n- From premise 2, we know there exists at least one person who is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n- If this person is not a schoolmate of Kenneth, they cannot be a cousin of Lawrence (from premise 1).\n- Therefore, this person is a counterexample to the statement that every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe premises logically lead to the conclusion that not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
