  "question": "\"Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: First, every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu. Second, every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an opponent to OGC Nice. Third, some fan of Burnley FC is an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu. It follows that some fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nLet's break down the premises and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n2. **Premise 2**: Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an opponent to OGC Nice.\n3. **Premise 3**: Some fan of Burnley FC is an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n\n**Conclusion**: Some fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows from the premises, let's analyze the logical connections:\n\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we know that being an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 implies being both an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu and an opponent to OGC Nice.\n- Premise 3 states that there exists a fan of Burnley FC who is both an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n\nThe conclusion claims that this fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945. For this to be true, the conditions of being an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 (as stated in Premises 1 and 2) must be met by the fan of Burnley FC.\n\nSince Premise 3 provides both conditions (opponent to OGC Nice and ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu) that are required to be an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
