    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. Premise 1: Every aunt of Rosa who is a sister of Amanda is also a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n2. Premise 2: It is not the case that Amy is an aunt of Rosa.\n3. Premise 3: Amy is a sister of Amanda.\n4. Conclusion: Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda, then they are a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n- Premise 2 states that Amy is not an aunt of Rosa. Therefore, Amy does not satisfy the condition of being both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda.\n- Premise 3 confirms that Amy is a sister of Amanda, but since she is not an aunt of Rosa, Premise 1 does not apply to her.\n\nThe conclusion states that Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen. Since Premise 1 only provides a condition under which someone would be a great-grandmother of Hellen, and Amy does not meet that condition, the conclusion that Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen is consistent with the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
