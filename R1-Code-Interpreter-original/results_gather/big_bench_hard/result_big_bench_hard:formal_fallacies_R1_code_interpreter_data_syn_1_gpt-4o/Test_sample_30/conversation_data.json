    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach.\n3. **Premise 3**: Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\n**Conclusion**: Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro.\n\nLet's analyze the premises and the conclusion:\n\n- **Premise 1** implies that if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they must either be an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n- **Premise 2** states that if someone is not an expert of SCR Altach, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n- **Premise 3** indicates that everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\nNow, let's see if these premises logically lead to the conclusion:\n\n- If someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, by Premise 1, they must be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n- If they are not an expert of SCR Altach, by Premise 2, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n- Premise 3 ensures that everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC, which means that if someone is not an opponent to West Ham United FC, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\nThus, if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC if they are not an opponent to West Ham United FC. This aligns with the conclusion that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro.\n\nThe argument seems to be logically consistent with the premises leading to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
