    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Not being a close friend of Williams is sufficient for not being a nephew of Rolando.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a close friend of Williams, then they are not a nephew of Rolando.\n   - In logical terms: If \\( \\neg F \\), then \\( \\neg N \\), where \\( F \\) is \"being a close friend of Williams\" and \\( N \\) is \"being a nephew of Rolando\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Every nephew of Rolando is a close friend of Williams.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a nephew of Rolando, then they are a close friend of Williams.\n   - In logical terms: If \\( N \\), then \\( F \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship:\n\n- The premise states a contrapositive relationship: If not \\( F \\), then not \\( N \\).\n- The conclusion is the direct implication: If \\( N \\), then \\( F \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. This means the argument is deductively valid.\n\nLet's confirm this reasoning with a simple Python script to check the logical equivalence.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid():\n    # Define the premise and conclusion\n    # Premise: If not F, then not N\n    # Conclusion: If N, then F\n    # We need to check if the contrapositive of the premise is equivalent to the conclusion\n\n    # Logical equivalence check\n    # If not F then not N is equivalent to If N then F\n    # This is a tautology check: (not F -> not N) is equivalent to (N -> F)\n    \n    # Let's assume F and N are boolean variables\n    # We will check all possible truth values for F and N\n    for F in [True, False]:\n        for N in [True, False]:\n            # Premise: If not F, then not N\n            premise = (not F) <= (not N)\n            # Conclusion: If N, then F\n            conclusion = N <= F\n            # Check if they are equivalent\n            if premise != conclusion:\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Check if the argument is valid\nprint(\"valid\" if is_valid() else \"invalid\")\n```\n\nThe code will check all possible truth values for the variables \\( F \\) and \\( N \\) to ensure the logical equivalence holds. If it does, the argument is valid. If not, it is invalid. Let's execute the code to confirm.",
    "The code output indicates that the argument is \"valid.\" This means that, based on the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion, the argument is deductively valid. The contrapositive of the premise is logically equivalent to the conclusion, confirming the validity of the argument.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
