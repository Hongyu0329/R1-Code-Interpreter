  "question": "\"Is Siri a stepsister of Mary? Is Susan related to Kate? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, being a close friend of Catherine is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie. Now, being a granddaughter of Courtney is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie. Moreover, whoever is not a classmate of Mary is however a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney. In consequence, whoever is not a classmate of Leslie is a classmate of Mary.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Premises:\n1. Being a close friend of Catherine is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie.\n2. Being a granddaughter of Courtney is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie.\n3. Whoever is not a classmate of Mary is a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Whoever is not a classmate of Leslie is a classmate of Mary.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From Premise 1 and 2, we can infer that if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must either be a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney (or both).\n- Premise 3 states that if someone is not a classmate of Mary, they must be either a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be a classmate of Mary.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n- If someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney (from Premises 1 and 2).\n- If someone is not a classmate of Mary, they must be a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney (from Premise 3).\n- Therefore, if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they cannot be not a classmate of Mary (otherwise, they would still be a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney, which contradicts the conclusion).\n- Hence, if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be a classmate of Mary.\n\nThe argument follows logically from the premises to the conclusion, making it deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
