So, necessarily, whatever is none of this: an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM or ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR, is an ingredient of Moisturizing Bar.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ingredient of Moisturizing Bar is neither an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR nor an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM.\n\n   This can be represented as:\n   - If X is an ingredient of Moisturizing Bar, then X is not an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR and X is not an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Whatever is none of this: an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM or ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR, is an ingredient of Moisturizing Bar.\n\n   This can be represented as:\n   - If X is not an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM and X is not an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR, then X is an ingredient of Moisturizing Bar.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. The premise states a condition about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar, but it does not provide information about the ingredients of the other two products in relation to the Moisturizing Bar. The conclusion, however, makes a claim about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar based on the absence of ingredients in the other two products.\n\nThe argument seems to be making a logical leap from the premise to the conclusion. The premise only tells us about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar, not about the ingredients of the other two products. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nLet's summarize this reasoning:\n\n- The premise states a condition about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar.\n- The conclusion makes a claim about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar based on the absence of ingredients in the other two products.\n- The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise because the premise does not provide information about the relationship between the ingredients of the other two products and the Moisturizing Bar.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
