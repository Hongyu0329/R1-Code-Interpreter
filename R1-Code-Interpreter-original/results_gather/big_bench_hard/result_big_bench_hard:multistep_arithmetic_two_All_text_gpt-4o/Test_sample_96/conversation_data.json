    "To solve the expression \\(((9 + 2 + 3 - -3) + (-5 + 6 - -6 - -9))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\(9 + 2 + 3 - -3\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(9 + 2 = 11\\).\n   - Then, \\(11 + 3 = 14\\).\n   - Finally, subtract \\(-3\\) which is equivalent to adding 3: \\(14 - -3 = 14 + 3 = 17\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\(-5 + 6 - -6 - -9\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(-5 + 6 = 1\\).\n   - Then, subtract \\(-6\\) which is equivalent to adding 6: \\(1 - -6 = 1 + 6 = 7\\).\n   - Finally, subtract \\(-9\\) which is equivalent to adding 9: \\(7 - -9 = 7 + 9 = 16\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two parts:**\n\n   - Add the results from step 1 and step 2: \\(17 + 16 = 33\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<33>>>"
