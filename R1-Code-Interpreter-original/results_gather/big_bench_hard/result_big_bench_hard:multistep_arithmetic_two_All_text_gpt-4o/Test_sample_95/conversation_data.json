    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 2) \\times (-9 - 1 \\times -9 \\times 3))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the innermost parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\((-8 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 2)\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-8 \\times 0 = 0\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n   - Add the results: \\(0 + 4 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the second set of parentheses is \\((-9 - 1 \\times -9 \\times 3)\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-9 \\times 3 = -27\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-1 \\times -27 = 27\\) (since multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number).\n   - Subtract the result from \\(-9\\): \\(-9 - 27 = -36\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two sets of parentheses:**\n   - Now we have \\(4 \\times -36\\).\n   - Calculate \\(4 \\times -36 = -144\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-144>>>"
