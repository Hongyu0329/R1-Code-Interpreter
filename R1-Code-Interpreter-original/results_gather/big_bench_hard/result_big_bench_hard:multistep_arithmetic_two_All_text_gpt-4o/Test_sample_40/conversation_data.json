    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 - 2 + 9 \\times -1) \\times (7 - 5 + 9 \\times -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\((-5 - 2 + 9 \\times -1)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(9 \\times -1 = -9\\)\n     - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-5 - 2 - 9)\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right:\n       - \\(-5 - 2 = -7\\)\n       - \\(-7 - 9 = -16\\)\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\((7 - 5 + 9 \\times -7)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(9 \\times -7 = -63\\)\n     - Substitute back into the expression: \\((7 - 5 - 63)\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right:\n       - \\(7 - 5 = 2\\)\n       - \\(2 - 63 = -61\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated expressions:**\n\n   - Multiply the results from the two sets of parentheses: \\((-16) \\times (-61)\\)\n   - Perform the multiplication: \n     - \\(-16 \\times -61 = 976\\)\n\nThe final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<976>>>"
