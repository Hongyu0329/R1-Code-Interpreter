    "To solve the expression \\(((3 - -6 - 7 + 3) + (-7 + 6 \\times 9 + 8))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((3 - -6 - 7 + 3)\\)**\n   - Start with the innermost operation: \\(3 - -6\\). Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding, so:\n     \\[\n     3 - -6 = 3 + 6 = 9\n     \\]\n   - Now, substitute back into the expression: \\(9 - 7 + 3\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(9 - 7 = 2\\).\n   - Add the remaining number: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((-7 + 6 \\times 9 + 8)\\)**\n   - Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which dictates that multiplication should be done before addition or subtraction.\n   - Calculate the multiplication: \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-7 + 54 + 8\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - First, add: \\(-7 + 54 = 47\\).\n     - Then, add the remaining number: \\(47 + 8 = 55\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from both parts:**\n   - Add the results from the two simplified parts: \\(5 + 55\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(5 + 55 = 60\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression \\(((3 - -6 - 7 + 3) + (-7 + 6 \\times 9 + 8))\\) is:\n\n<<<60>>>"
