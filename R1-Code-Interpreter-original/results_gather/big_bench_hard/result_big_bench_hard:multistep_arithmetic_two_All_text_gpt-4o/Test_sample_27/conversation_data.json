    "To solve the expression \\(((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 * -4))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((9 - 3 + 2 + -1)\\)**\n   - Start with \\(9\\).\n   - Subtract \\(3\\): \\(9 - 3 = 6\\).\n   - Add \\(2\\): \\(6 + 2 = 8\\).\n   - Add \\(-1\\): \\(8 + (-1) = 7\\).\n\n   So, \\((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) = 7\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((5 - -1 - -6 * -4)\\)**\n   - Start with \\(5\\).\n   - Subtract \\(-1\\): \\(5 - (-1) = 5 + 1 = 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-6 * -4\\): \\(-6 * -4 = 24\\) (since multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result).\n   - Subtract \\(24\\): \\(6 - 24 = -18\\).\n\n   So, \\((5 - -1 - -6 * -4) = -18\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two parts:**\n   - Subtract the result of the second part from the result of the first part: \\(7 - (-18)\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive: \\(7 + 18 = 25\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<25>>>"
