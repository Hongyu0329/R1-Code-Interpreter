    "To solve the expression \\(((-4 + -5 * 7 + 7) + (3 * -3 - -4 + 4))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-4 + -5 * 7 + 7)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-5 * 7 = -35\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-4 + -35 + 7)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-4 + -35 = -39\\).\n     - \\(-39 + 7 = -32\\).\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-32\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((3 * -3 - -4 + 4)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(3 * -3 = -9\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-9 - -4 + 4)\\).\n   - Simplify the double negative: \\(-9 + 4 + 4\\).\n   - Perform the addition from left to right:\n     - \\(-9 + 4 = -5\\).\n     - \\(-5 + 4 = -1\\).\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two sets of parentheses: \\((-32) + (-1)\\)**\n\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-32 + -1 = -33\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is \\(-33\\).\n\n<<<-33>>>"
