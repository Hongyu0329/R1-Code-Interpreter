    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 - -4 * 2 - 9) * (9 - 6 - 1 + -4))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-7 - -4 * 2 - 9)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(-4 * 2 = -8\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-7 - (-8) - 9\\).\n   - Simplify the subtraction: \\(-7 + 8 - 9\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-7 + 8 = 1\\).\n   - Then, \\(1 - 9 = -8\\).\n\n   So, the simplified expression inside the first parentheses is \\(-8\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((9 - 6 - 1 + -4)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the subtraction: \\(9 - 6 = 3\\).\n   - Then, \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n   - Finally, \\(2 + (-4) = 2 - 4 = -2\\).\n\n   So, the simplified expression inside the second parentheses is \\(-2\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two simplified expressions:**\n\n   - Multiply \\(-8\\) by \\(-2\\): \\(-8 * -2 = 16\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
