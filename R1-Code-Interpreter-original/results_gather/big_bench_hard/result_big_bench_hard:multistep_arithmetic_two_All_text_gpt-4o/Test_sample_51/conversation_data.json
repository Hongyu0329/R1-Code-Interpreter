    "To solve the expression \\(((-3 - 8 \\times 5 + 5) - (-1 \\times -3 - -2 - 6))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-3 - 8 \\times 5 + 5)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-3 - 40 + 5)\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(-3 - 40 = -43\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-43 + 5 = -38\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the first parentheses evaluates to \\(-38\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((-1 \\times -3 - -2 - 6)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-1 \\times -3 = 3\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((3 - -2 - 6)\\).\n   - Simplify the double negative: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(5 - 6 = -1\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the second parentheses evaluates to \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the result of the second parentheses from the result of the first parentheses: \\((-38) - (-1)\\).**\n\n   - Simplify the double negative: \\(-38 + 1 = -37\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is \\(-37\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-37>>>"
