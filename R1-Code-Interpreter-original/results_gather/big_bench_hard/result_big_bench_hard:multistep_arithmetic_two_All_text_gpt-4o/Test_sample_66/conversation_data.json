    "To solve the expression \\(((4 + 5 \\times -9 \\times -8) - (-9 + -7 - -6 - -9))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\(4 + 5 \\times -9 \\times -8\\).\n   - According to the order of operations, perform the multiplication first:\n     - \\(5 \\times -9 = -45\\)\n     - \\(-45 \\times -8 = 360\\)\n   - Now, substitute back into the expression: \\(4 + 360\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the addition inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   - \\(4 + 360 = 364\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   - The expression is \\(-9 + -7 - -6 - -9\\).\n   - Simplify the double negatives:\n     - \\(-9 + -7 + 6 + 9\\)\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     - \\(-9 + -7 = -16\\)\n     - \\(-16 + 6 = -10\\)\n     - \\(-10 + 9 = -1\\)\n\n4. **Substitute the results back into the main expression:**\n   - The expression now is \\(364 - (-1)\\).\n\n5. **Simplify the subtraction of a negative number:**\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive:\n   - \\(364 + 1 = 365\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<365>>>"
