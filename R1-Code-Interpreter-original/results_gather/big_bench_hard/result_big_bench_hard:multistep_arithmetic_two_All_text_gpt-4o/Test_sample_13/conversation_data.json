    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 + -9 - -6 + -4) * (-1 - -6 + -4 - 3))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-6 + -9 - -6 + -4)\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(-6 + -9\\):\n     \\[\n     -6 + -9 = -15\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, subtract \\(-6\\) (which is equivalent to adding 6):\n     \\[\n     -15 - -6 = -15 + 6 = -9\n     \\]\n\n   - Finally, add \\(-4\\):\n     \\[\n     -9 + -4 = -13\n     \\]\n\n   So, the simplified result of the first part is \\(-13\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((-1 - -6 + -4 - 3)\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(-1 - -6\\) (which is equivalent to adding 6):\n     \\[\n     -1 - -6 = -1 + 6 = 5\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, add \\(-4\\):\n     \\[\n     5 + -4 = 1\n     \\]\n\n   - Finally, subtract 3:\n     \\[\n     1 - 3 = -2\n     \\]\n\n   So, the simplified result of the second part is \\(-2\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parts: \\((-13) * (-2)\\)**\n\n   - Multiply \\(-13\\) by \\(-2\\):\n     \\[\n     -13 \\times -2 = 26\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer to the expression is 26.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<26>>>"
