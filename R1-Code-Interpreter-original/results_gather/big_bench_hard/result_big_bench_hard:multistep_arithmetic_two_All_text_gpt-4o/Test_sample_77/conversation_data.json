    "To solve the expression \\(((5 \\times 1 \\times 3 - 9) \\times (-7 + 4 - -7 \\times -3))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\(5 \\times 1 \\times 3 - 9\\).\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\).\n     - Then, multiply the result by 3: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n     - Finally, subtract 9: \\(15 - 9 = 6\\).\n   - The expression inside the second set of parentheses is \\(-7 + 4 - -7 \\times -3\\).\n     - First, handle the multiplication: \\(-7 \\times -3 = 21\\).\n     - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n       - \\(-7 + 4 = -3\\).\n       - \\(-3 - 21 = -24\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated expressions**:\n   - Multiply the result from the first parentheses by the result from the second parentheses: \\(6 \\times -24\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the final result**:\n   - \\(6 \\times -24 = -144\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-144>>>"
