    "To solve the expression \\(((7 \\times 9 \\times 3 \\times 6) \\times (-8 \\times -6 + -9 + -5))\\), we need to break it down into smaller parts and solve it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Solve the innermost expressions\n1. **Calculate \\(-8 \\times -6\\):**\n   - Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number.\n   - \\(-8 \\times -6 = 48\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - The expression is \\(48 + -9 + -5\\).\n   - First, add \\(48\\) and \\(-9\\): \\(48 + (-9) = 39\\).\n   - Then, add \\(39\\) and \\(-5\\): \\(39 + (-5) = 34\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the first part of the expression\n1. **Calculate \\(7 \\times 9 \\times 3 \\times 6\\):**\n   - First, multiply \\(7\\) and \\(9\\): \\(7 \\times 9 = 63\\).\n   - Then, multiply \\(63\\) and \\(3\\): \\(63 \\times 3 = 189\\).\n   - Finally, multiply \\(189\\) and \\(6\\): \\(189 \\times 6 = 1134\\).\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results\n1. **Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2:**\n   - Multiply \\(1134\\) (from Step 2) by \\(34\\) (from Step 1).\n   - \\(1134 \\times 34 = 38556\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<38556>>>"
