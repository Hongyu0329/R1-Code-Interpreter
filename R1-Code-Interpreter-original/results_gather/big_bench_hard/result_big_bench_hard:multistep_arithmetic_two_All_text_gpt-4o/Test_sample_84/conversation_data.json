    "To solve the expression \\(((8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8) - (2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   8 + 3 \\times -8 - -8\n   \\]\n   - First, perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times -8 = -24\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     8 + (-24) - -8\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the addition and subtraction:\n     \\[\n     8 - 24 + 8\n     \\]\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     \\[\n     (8 - 24) + 8 = -16 + 8 = -8\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   2 + 2 \\times -9 - 6\n   \\]\n   - First, perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times -9 = -18\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     2 + (-18) - 6\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the addition and subtraction:\n     \\[\n     2 - 18 - 6\n     \\]\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     \\[\n     (2 - 18) - 6 = -16 - 6 = -22\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   (-8) - (-22)\n   \\]\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding:\n     \\[\n     -8 + 22\n     \\]\n   - Perform the addition:\n     \\[\n     22 - 8 = 14\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).\n\n<<<14>>>"
