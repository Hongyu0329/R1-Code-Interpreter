    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 + -9 - -2 * 2) - (6 * 1 * -2 * -1))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the innermost expressions:**\n   - The expression \\(-2 * 2\\) is calculated first:\n     \\[\n     -2 * 2 = -4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substitute back into the expression:**\n   - Replace \\(-2 * 2\\) with \\(-4\\) in the expression:\n     \\[\n     (-2 + -9 - (-4))\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the first part of the expression:**\n   - Calculate \\(-2 + -9\\):\n     \\[\n     -2 + -9 = -11\n     \\]\n   - Now, simplify \\(-11 - (-4)\\):\n     \\[\n     -11 - (-4) = -11 + 4 = -7\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the second part of the expression:**\n   - The expression \\(6 * 1 * -2 * -1\\) is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     6 * 1 = 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     6 * -2 = -12\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -12 * -1 = 12\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute back into the main expression:**\n   - Replace \\(6 * 1 * -2 * -1\\) with \\(12\\) in the expression:\n     \\[\n     (-7) - (12)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the entire expression:**\n   - Calculate \\(-7 - 12\\):\n     \\[\n     -7 - 12 = -19\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-19>>>"
