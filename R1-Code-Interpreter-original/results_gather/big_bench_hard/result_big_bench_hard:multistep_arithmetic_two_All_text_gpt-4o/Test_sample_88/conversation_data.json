    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - -1 - -5 * -5) + (8 + -5 - 9 * -7))\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify and Simplify Parentheses:**\n   - The expression is divided into two main parts by the outer parentheses: \\((-6 - -1 - -5 * -5)\\) and \\((8 + -5 - 9 * -7)\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the First Part: \\((-6 - -1 - -5 * -5)\\):**\n   - Inside the parentheses, handle the multiplication first: \\(-5 * -5 = 25\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-6 - -1 - 25)\\).\n   - Simplify the subtraction of negative numbers:\n     - \\(-6 - -1\\) becomes \\(-6 + 1 = -5\\).\n   - Now, simplify \\(-5 - 25 = -30\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Second Part: \\((8 + -5 - 9 * -7)\\):**\n   - Inside the parentheses, handle the multiplication first: \\(-9 * -7 = 63\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((8 + -5 - 63)\\).\n   - Simplify the addition and subtraction:\n     - \\(8 + -5\\) becomes \\(8 - 5 = 3\\).\n     - Now, simplify \\(3 - 63 = -60\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Results of Both Parts:**\n   - Now, add the results of the two parts: \\((-30) + (-60)\\).\n   - Simplify the addition: \\(-30 + -60 = -90\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-90>>>"
