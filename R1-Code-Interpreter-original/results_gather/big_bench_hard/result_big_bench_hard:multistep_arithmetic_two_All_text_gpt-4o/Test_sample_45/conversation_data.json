    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 - 6 \\times 5 + -9) + (1 + -4 - -2 \\times 6))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-5 - 6 \\times 5 + -9)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-5 - 30 + -9\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n     - \\(-5 - 30 = -35\\).\n     - \\(-35 + -9 = -44\\).\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-44\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((1 + -4 - -2 \\times 6)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-2 \\times 6 = -12\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(1 + -4 - (-12)\\).\n   - Simplify the subtraction of a negative number: \\(1 + -4 + 12\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(1 + -4 = -3\\).\n     - \\(-3 + 12 = 9\\).\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(9\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two sets of parentheses: \\((-44) + (9)\\)**\n\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-44 + 9 = -35\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-35\\).\n\n<<<-35>>>"
