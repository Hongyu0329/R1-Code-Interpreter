    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 - 5 \\times -5 - 6) + (-5 \\times -4 + 2 + -2))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\((-2 - 5 \\times -5 - 6)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(5 \\times -5 = -25\\)\n     - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-2 - (-25) - 6)\\)\n     - Simplify the subtraction: \\(-2 + 25 - 6\\)\n     - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n       - \\(-2 + 25 = 23\\)\n       - \\(23 - 6 = 17\\)\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\((-5 \\times -4 + 2 + -2)\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-5 \\times -4 = 20\\)\n     - Substitute back into the expression: \\(20 + 2 + (-2)\\)\n     - Simplify the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n       - \\(20 + 2 = 22\\)\n       - \\(22 + (-2) = 20\\)\n\n2. **Combine the results from both sets of parentheses:**\n\n   - Add the results from the two evaluated expressions: \\(17 + 20\\)\n\n3. **Perform the final addition:**\n\n   - \\(17 + 20 = 37\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<37>>>"
