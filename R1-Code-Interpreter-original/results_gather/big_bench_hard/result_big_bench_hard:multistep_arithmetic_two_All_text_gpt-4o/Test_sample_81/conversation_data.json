    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + -4 * -9 * 0) + (2 * -9 + 3 * -3))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-8 + -4 * -9 * 0)\\)**\n\n   - First, handle the multiplication: \\(-4 * -9 * 0\\).\n     - \\(-4 * -9 = 36\\)\n     - \\(36 * 0 = 0\\)\n\n   - Now substitute back into the expression: \\(-8 + 0\\).\n     - \\(-8 + 0 = -8\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((2 * -9 + 3 * -3)\\)**\n\n   - First, handle the multiplications:\n     - \\(2 * -9 = -18\\)\n     - \\(3 * -3 = -9\\)\n\n   - Now substitute back into the expression: \\(-18 + -9\\).\n     - \\(-18 + -9 = -27\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two sets of parentheses: \\((-8) + (-27)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-8 + -27 = -35\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-35>>>"
