    "To solve the expression \\(((8 - 2 + -2 * 6) * (8 + -6 + -8 + -1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - First, evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((8 - 2 + -2 * 6)\\).\n     - According to PEMDAS, handle multiplication first: \\(-2 * 6 = -12\\).\n     - Substitute back into the expression: \\(8 - 2 + (-12)\\).\n     - Perform the operations from left to right:\n       - \\(8 - 2 = 6\\).\n       - \\(6 + (-12) = 6 - 12 = -6\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**: \\((8 + -6 + -8 + -1)\\).\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     - \\(8 + (-6) = 8 - 6 = 2\\).\n     - \\(2 + (-8) = 2 - 8 = -6\\).\n     - \\(-6 + (-1) = -6 - 1 = -7\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - Multiply the results from step 1 and step 2: \\((-6) * (-7)\\).\n   - The product of two negative numbers is positive: \\(-6 * -7 = 42\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<42>>>"
