    "To solve the expression \\(((4 - 3 \\times -1 \\times 3) \\times (3 + 8 + 1 - 7))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\(4 - 3 \\times -1 \\times 3\\).**\n\n   - First, handle the multiplication: \\(3 \\times -1 = -3\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 3: \\(-3 \\times 3 = -9\\).\n   - Now, substitute back into the expression: \\(4 - (-9)\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding: \\(4 + 9 = 13\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\(3 + 8 + 1 - 7\\).**\n\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(3 + 8 = 11\\).\n     - \\(11 + 1 = 12\\).\n     - \\(12 - 7 = 5\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated expressions: \\(13 \\times 5\\).**\n\n   - \\(13 \\times 5 = 65\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<65>>>"
