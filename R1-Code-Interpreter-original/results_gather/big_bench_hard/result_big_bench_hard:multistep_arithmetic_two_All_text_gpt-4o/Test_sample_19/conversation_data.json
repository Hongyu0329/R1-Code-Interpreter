    "To solve the expression \\(((7 - 4 + -3 * 4) - (5 + -8 - 6 + -5))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((7 - 4 + -3 * 4)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(-3 * 4 = -12\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(7 - 4 + (-12)\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(7 - 4 = 3\\).\n   - Add the result to \\(-12\\): \\(3 + (-12) = 3 - 12 = -9\\).\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-9\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((5 + -8 - 6 + -5)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(5 + (-8) = 5 - 8 = -3\\).\n     - \\(-3 - 6 = -3 - 6 = -9\\).\n     - \\(-9 + (-5) = -9 - 5 = -14\\).\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(-14\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses: \\((-9) - (-14)\\)**\n\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive: \\(-9 + 14\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-9 + 14 = 5\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
