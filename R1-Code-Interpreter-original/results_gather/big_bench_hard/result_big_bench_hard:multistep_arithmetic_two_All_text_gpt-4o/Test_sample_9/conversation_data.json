    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 - 1 \\times 5 \\times -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 \\times -7))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-9 - 1 \\times 5 \\times -5)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\)\n   - Then, multiply by \\(-5\\): \\(5 \\times -5 = -25\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-9 - (-25)\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(-9 + 25 = 16\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((6 + -3 - -1 \\times -7)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-1 \\times -7 = 7\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(6 + -3 - 7\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(6 - 3 - 7 = 3 - 7 = -4\\)\n\n3. **Substitute the results back into the main expression: \\((16 - (-4))\\)**\n\n   - Simplify: \\(16 + 4 = 20\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
