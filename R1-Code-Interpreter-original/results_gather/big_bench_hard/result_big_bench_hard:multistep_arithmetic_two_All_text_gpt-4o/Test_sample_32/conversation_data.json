    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 + -2 \\times 1 - 6) + (3 + 9 \\times 7 + -7))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-7 + -2 \\times 1 - 6)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-2 \\times 1 = -2\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-7 + -2 - 6)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-7 + -2 = -9\\).\n     - \\(-9 - 6 = -15\\).\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-15\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((3 + 9 \\times 7 + -7)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((3 + 63 + -7)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(3 + 63 = 66\\).\n     - \\(66 + -7 = 59\\).\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(59\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two sets of parentheses: \\((-15) + (59)\\).**\n\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-15 + 59 = 44\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<44>>>"
