    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 \\times -1 - 2 + -2) + (9 - 4 + -1 - 7))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part of the expression: \\((-6 \\times -1 - 2 + -2)\\)**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-6 \\times -1\\):\n     \\[\n     -6 \\times -1 = 6\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     6 - 2 + -2\n     \\]\n\n   - Perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n     \\[\n     6 - 2 = 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4 + -2 = 2\n     \\]\n\n   So, the first part of the expression evaluates to 2.\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part of the expression: \\((9 - 4 + -1 - 7)\\)**\n\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     \\[\n     9 - 4 = 5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5 + -1 = 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4 - 7 = -3\n     \\]\n\n   So, the second part of the expression evaluates to -3.\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - Add the results from the first and second parts:\n     \\[\n     2 + (-3) = 2 - 3 = -1\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
