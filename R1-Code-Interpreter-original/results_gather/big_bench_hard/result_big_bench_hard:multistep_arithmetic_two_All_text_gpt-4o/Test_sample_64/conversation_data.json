    "To solve the expression \\(((4 + -1 + -7 + 2) - (-7 + -9 \\times -6 + -3))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   4 + (-1) + (-7) + 2\n   \\]\n   - \\(4 + (-1) = 3\\)\n   - \\(3 + (-7) = -4\\)\n   - \\(-4 + 2 = -2\\)\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-2\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -7 + (-9 \\times -6) + (-3)\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(-9 \\times -6 = 54\\)\n   - Then, add the results: \\(-7 + 54 = 47\\)\n   - Finally, add \\(-3\\): \\(47 + (-3) = 44\\)\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(44\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the result of the second set of parentheses from the result of the first set:**\n   \\[\n   -2 - 44\n   \\]\n   - This is equivalent to \\(-2 + (-44) = -46\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-46\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-46>>>"
