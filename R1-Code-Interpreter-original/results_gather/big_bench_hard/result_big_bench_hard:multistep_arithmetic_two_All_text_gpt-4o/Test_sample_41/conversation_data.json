    "To solve the expression \\(((5 - 7 - 8 - 6) * (-2 * -8 * -9 + 4))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   5 - 7 - 8 - 6\n   \\]\n   - Start with \\(5 - 7 = -2\\).\n   - Then, \\(-2 - 8 = -10\\).\n   - Finally, \\(-10 - 6 = -16\\).\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-16\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -2 * -8 * -9 + 4\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate the product of the three negative numbers: \n     - \\(-2 * -8 = 16\\).\n     - Then, \\(16 * -9 = -144\\).\n   - Now, add 4 to the result: \n     - \\(-144 + 4 = -140\\).\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(-140\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two sets of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   (-16) * (-140)\n   \\]\n   - Multiply the two negative numbers: \n     - \\(-16 * -140 = 2240\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2240}\n\\]\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<2240>>>"
