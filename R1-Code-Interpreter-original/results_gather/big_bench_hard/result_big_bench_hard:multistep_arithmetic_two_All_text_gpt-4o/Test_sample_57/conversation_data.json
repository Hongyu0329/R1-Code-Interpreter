    "To solve the expression \\(((5 + 6 * 4 * 9) + (-9 - 0 * 3 - 1))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: The entire expression is within parentheses, but we need to evaluate the operations inside the parentheses first.\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Within the first set of parentheses \\((5 + 6 * 4 * 9)\\), we perform the multiplication first:\n   - \\(6 * 4 = 24\\)\n   - \\(24 * 9 = 216\\)\n\n3. **Addition**: Now, add the result of the multiplication to 5:\n   - \\(5 + 216 = 221\\)\n\n4. **Second set of parentheses**: Evaluate \\((-9 - 0 * 3 - 1)\\):\n   - **Multiplication**: \\(0 * 3 = 0\\)\n   - **Subtraction**: \\(-9 - 0 = -9\\)\n   - **Subtraction**: \\(-9 - 1 = -10\\)\n\n5. **Final Addition**: Add the results from the two sets of parentheses:\n   - \\(221 + (-10) = 211\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<211>>>"
