    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 - -7 + 5 * -3) + (2 - 8 + 5 * -7))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-2 - -7 + 5 * -3)\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(-2 - -7\\):\n     - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive, so \\(-2 - -7 = -2 + 7 = 5\\).\n\n   - Next, calculate \\(5 * -3\\):\n     - Multiplying a positive by a negative gives a negative result, so \\(5 * -3 = -15\\).\n\n   - Now, combine the results: \\(5 + (-15)\\):\n     - Adding a negative is the same as subtracting, so \\(5 + (-15) = 5 - 15 = -10\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((2 - 8 + 5 * -7)\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(2 - 8\\):\n     - Subtracting gives \\(2 - 8 = -6\\).\n\n   - Next, calculate \\(5 * -7\\):\n     - Again, multiplying a positive by a negative gives a negative result, so \\(5 * -7 = -35\\).\n\n   - Now, combine the results: \\(-6 + (-35)\\):\n     - Adding a negative is the same as subtracting, so \\(-6 + (-35) = -6 - 35 = -41\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parts: \\((-10) + (-41)\\)**\n\n   - Adding two negative numbers results in a more negative number, so \\(-10 + (-41) = -10 - 41 = -51\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-51>>>"
