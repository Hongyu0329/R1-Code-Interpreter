    "To solve the expression \\(((5 \\times -8 - -5 \\times -9) \\times (2 - -7 \\times 6 - 4))\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n1. **Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:**\n\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(5 \\times -8 - -5 \\times -9\\)\n     - Calculate \\(5 \\times -8 = -40\\).\n     - Calculate \\(-5 \\times -9 = 45\\).\n     - Now, substitute these values back into the expression: \\(-40 - 45\\).\n     - Perform the subtraction: \\(-40 - 45 = -85\\).\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(2 - -7 \\times 6 - 4\\)\n     - Calculate \\(-7 \\times 6 = -42\\).\n     - Substitute this value back into the expression: \\(2 - (-42) - 4\\).\n     - Simplify \\(2 - (-42)\\) to \\(2 + 42 = 44\\).\n     - Now, perform the subtraction: \\(44 - 4 = 40\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses:**\n\n   - Multiply the results from the two parentheses: \\(-85 \\times 40\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-85 \\times 40 = -3400\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-3400>>>"
