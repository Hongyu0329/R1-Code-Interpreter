    "To solve the expression \\(((1 + 7 \\times -9 + -5) + (3 + -5 \\times 2 - 6))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((1 + 7 \\times -9 + -5)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(7 \\times -9 = -63\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(1 + (-63) + (-5)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(1 + (-63) = -62\\).\n     - \\(-62 + (-5) = -67\\).\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-67\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((3 + -5 \\times 2 - 6)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-5 \\times 2 = -10\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(3 + (-10) - 6\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(3 + (-10) = -7\\).\n     - \\(-7 - 6 = -13\\).\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(-13\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two sets of parentheses: \\((-67) + (-13)\\)**\n\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-67 + (-13) = -80\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is \\(-80\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-80>>>"
