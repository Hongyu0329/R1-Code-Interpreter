    "To solve the expression \\(((0 - -1 + -1 + -3) - (-3 * 0 * 8 + 6))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the innermost expressions:**\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\(0 - -1 + -1 + -3\\).\n   - Simplify \\(0 - -1\\) to \\(0 + 1 = 1\\).\n   - Then, \\(1 + -1 = 0\\).\n   - Finally, \\(0 + -3 = -3\\).\n   - So, the expression inside the first parentheses simplifies to \\(-3\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   - The expression is \\(-3 * 0 * 8 + 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-3 * 0 = 0\\).\n   - Then, \\(0 * 8 = 0\\).\n   - Finally, \\(0 + 6 = 6\\).\n   - So, the expression inside the second parentheses simplifies to \\(6\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the simplified expressions back into the main expression:**\n   - The main expression now becomes \\((-3) - (6)\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the final result:**\n   - \\(-3 - 6 = -9\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-9>>>"
