    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 - -7 + 2 + 2) + (-7 + -9 - -1 - 0))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-9 - -7 + 2 + 2)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-9 - -7\\) is equivalent to \\(-9 + 7\\), which equals \\(-2\\).\n   - Now, add 2: \\(-2 + 2 = 0\\).\n   - Add another 2: \\(0 + 2 = 2\\).\n\n   So, the simplified result of the first part is \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((-7 + -9 - -1 - 0)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-7 + -9\\) is equivalent to \\(-7 - 9\\), which equals \\(-16\\).\n   - \\(-16 - -1\\) is equivalent to \\(-16 + 1\\), which equals \\(-15\\).\n   - Subtract 0: \\(-15 - 0 = -15\\).\n\n   So, the simplified result of the second part is \\(-15\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - Add the results from the first and second parts: \\(2 + (-15)\\).\n   - This is equivalent to \\(2 - 15\\), which equals \\(-13\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-13\\).\n\n<<<-13>>>"
