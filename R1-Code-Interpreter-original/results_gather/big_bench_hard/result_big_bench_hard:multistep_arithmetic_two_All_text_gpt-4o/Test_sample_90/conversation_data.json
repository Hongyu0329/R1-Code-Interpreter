    "To solve the expression \\(((-2 - 2 * 2 + 0) - (7 - 6 - -7 - -1))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-2 - 2 * 2 + 0)\\).**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(2 * 2 = 4\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-2 - 4 + 0\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(-2 - 4 = -6\\).\n   - Add 0: \\(-6 + 0 = -6\\).\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(-6\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((7 - 6 - -7 - -1)\\).**\n\n   - Start with the first subtraction: \\(7 - 6 = 1\\).\n   - Handle the double negatives: \\(- -7\\) becomes \\(+ 7\\) and \\(- -1\\) becomes \\(+ 1\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(1 + 7 + 1\\).\n   - Perform the additions: \\(1 + 7 = 8\\) and then \\(8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(9\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses: \\((-6) - (9)\\).**\n\n   - Perform the subtraction: \\(-6 - 9 = -15\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-15\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-15>>>"
