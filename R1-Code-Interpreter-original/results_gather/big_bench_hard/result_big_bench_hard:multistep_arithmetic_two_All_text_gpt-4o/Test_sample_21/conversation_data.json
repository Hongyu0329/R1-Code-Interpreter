    "To solve the expression \\(((8 * -6 + 6 * 1) - (-3 * 7 * 0 - 7))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   - \\(8 * -6 = -48\\)\n   - \\(6 * 1 = 6\\)\n\n2. **Add the results from step 1:**\n   - \\(-48 + 6 = -42\\)\n\n3. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   - \\(-3 * 7 * 0 = 0\\) (since any number multiplied by 0 is 0)\n\n4. **Subtract 7 from the result of step 3:**\n   - \\(0 - 7 = -7\\)\n\n5. **Subtract the result of step 4 from the result of step 2:**\n   - \\(-42 - (-7) = -42 + 7 = -35\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-35>>>"
