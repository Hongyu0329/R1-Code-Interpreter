    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 4 * 2 - 6) + (1 + -2 * 1 * 7))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-6 - 4 * 2 - 6)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(4 * 2 = 8\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-6 - 8 - 6)\\).\n   - Perform the subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\).\n     - \\(-14 - 6 = -20\\).\n\n   So, the value of the first set of parentheses is \\(-20\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((1 + -2 * 1 * 7)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-2 * 1 = -2\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by 7: \\(-2 * 7 = -14\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((1 + -14)\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(1 + (-14) = -13\\).\n\n   So, the value of the second set of parentheses is \\(-13\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parentheses: \\((-20) + (-13)\\).**\n\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-20 + (-13) = -33\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-33\\).\n\n<<<-33>>>"
