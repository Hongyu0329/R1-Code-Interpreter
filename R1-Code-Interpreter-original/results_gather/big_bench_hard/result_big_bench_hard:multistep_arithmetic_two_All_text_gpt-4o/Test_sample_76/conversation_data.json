    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 - -6 * 7 * 0) * (0 + -5 * -8 - 0))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The expression is \\((-8 - -6 * 7 * 0)\\) and \\((0 + -5 * -8 - 0)\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the first set of parentheses \\((-8 - -6 * 7 * 0)\\)**:\n   - Inside the parentheses, perform multiplication first: \\(-6 * 7 * 0\\).\n   - \\(-6 * 7 = -42\\).\n   - \\(-42 * 0 = 0\\).\n   - Now substitute back into the expression: \\(-8 - 0\\).\n   - \\(-8 - 0 = -8\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses \\((0 + -5 * -8 - 0)\\)**:\n   - Inside the parentheses, perform multiplication first: \\(-5 * -8\\).\n   - \\(-5 * -8 = 40\\).\n   - Now substitute back into the expression: \\(0 + 40 - 0\\).\n   - \\(0 + 40 = 40\\).\n   - \\(40 - 0 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results from the parentheses**:\n   - Now we have \\((-8) * (40)\\).\n\n5. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - \\(-8 * 40 = -320\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-320>>>"
