    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 + -4 + 0 * -1) * (4 * -3 * -8 - -4))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expressions first:**\n\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\((-9 + -4 + 0 * -1)\\).\n     - Calculate \\(0 * -1\\): \n       \\[\n       0 * -1 = 0\n       \\]\n     - Substitute back into the expression:\n       \\[\n       -9 + -4 + 0 = -9 - 4 + 0 = -13\n       \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses:**\n\n   - The expression inside the second set of parentheses is \\((4 * -3 * -8 - -4)\\).\n     - Calculate \\(4 * -3\\):\n       \\[\n       4 * -3 = -12\n       \\]\n     - Calculate \\(-12 * -8\\):\n       \\[\n       -12 * -8 = 96\n       \\]\n     - Substitute back into the expression:\n       \\[\n       96 - -4 = 96 + 4 = 100\n       \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results from both sets of parentheses:**\n\n   - Now, substitute the results back into the main expression:\n     \\[\n     (-13) * (100)\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(-13 * 100\\):\n     \\[\n     -13 * 100 = -1300\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-1300>>>"
