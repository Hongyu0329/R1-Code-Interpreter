    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4) \\times (-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-8 + 6 \\times -2 + 4)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(6 \\times -2 = -12\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-8 - 12 + 4)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-8 - 12 = -20\\).\n     - \\(-20 + 4 = -16\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the first parentheses evaluates to \\(-16\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((-4 \\times 5 + 2 - 8)\\).**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-4 \\times 5 = -20\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-20 + 2 - 8)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-20 + 2 = -18\\).\n     - \\(-18 - 8 = -26\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the second parentheses evaluates to \\(-26\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated expressions: \\((-16) \\times (-26)\\).**\n\n   - Multiply the two numbers: \\(-16 \\times -26 = 416\\).\n\nThe final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<416>>>"
