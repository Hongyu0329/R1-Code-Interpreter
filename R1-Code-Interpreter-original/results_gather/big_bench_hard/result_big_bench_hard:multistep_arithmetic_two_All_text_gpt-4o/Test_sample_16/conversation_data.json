    "To solve the expression \\(((8 + 9 - 4 - -9) + (8 + 7 - 6 \\times 1))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first set of parentheses: \\((8 + 9 - 4 - -9)\\)**\n   - Start with the addition: \\(8 + 9 = 17\\)\n   - Subtract 4: \\(17 - 4 = 13\\)\n   - Handle the double negative: \\(- -9\\) is equivalent to \\(+9\\)\n   - Add 9: \\(13 + 9 = 22\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses: \\((8 + 7 - 6 \\times 1)\\)**\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n   - Add 8 and 7: \\(8 + 7 = 15\\)\n   - Subtract 6: \\(15 - 6 = 9\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results from both sets of parentheses:**\n   - Add the results: \\(22 + 9 = 31\\)\n\nThe final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<31>>>"
