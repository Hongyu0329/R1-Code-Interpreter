    "To solve the expression \\(((0 \\times 9 + -8 \\times 7) - (7 - 9 + 1 + 0))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the Multiplications:**\n   - \\(0 \\times 9 = 0\\)\n   - \\(-8 \\times 7 = -56\\)\n\n2. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\((0 + -56) - (7 - 9 + 1 + 0)\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the first part of the expression:**\n   - \\(0 + -56 = -56\\)\n\n4. **Evaluate the second part of the expression inside the parentheses:**\n   - \\(7 - 9 = -2\\)\n   - \\(-2 + 1 = -1\\)\n   - \\(-1 + 0 = -1\\)\n\n5. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now is \\(-56 - (-1)\\).\n\n6. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(-56 - (-1) = -56 + 1\\).\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   - \\(-56 + 1 = -55\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-55>>>"
