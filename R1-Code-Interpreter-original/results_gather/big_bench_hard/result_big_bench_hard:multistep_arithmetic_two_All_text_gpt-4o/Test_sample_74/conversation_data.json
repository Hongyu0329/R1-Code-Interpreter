    "To solve the expression \\(((-3 - -6 - -7 + 3) + (5 * 5 * 1 - -3))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-3 - -6 - -7 + 3)\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(-3 - -6\\): \n     - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(-3 - -6 = -3 + 6 = 3\\).\n\n   - Next, take the result and subtract \\(-7\\):\n     - Again, subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(3 - -7 = 3 + 7 = 10\\).\n\n   - Finally, add 3 to the result:\n     - \\(10 + 3 = 13\\).\n\n   So, the simplified result of the first part is \\(13\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((5 * 5 * 1 - -3)\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(5 * 5 * 1\\):\n     - \\(5 * 5 = 25\\).\n     - \\(25 * 1 = 25\\).\n\n   - Next, subtract \\(-3\\):\n     - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(25 - -3 = 25 + 3 = 28\\).\n\n   So, the simplified result of the second part is \\(28\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two parts:**\n\n   - Add the results from the first and second parts: \n     - \\(13 + 28 = 41\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<41>>>"
