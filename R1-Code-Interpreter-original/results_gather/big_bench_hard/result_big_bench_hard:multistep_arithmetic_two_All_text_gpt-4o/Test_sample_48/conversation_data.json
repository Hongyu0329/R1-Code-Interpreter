    "To solve the expression \\(((5 * -2 + 8 * 1) * (9 + -3 * -8 - -5))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   5 * -2 + 8 * 1\n   \\]\n   - First, perform the multiplications:\n     - \\(5 * -2 = -10\\)\n     - \\(8 * 1 = 8\\)\n   - Then, perform the addition:\n     - \\(-10 + 8 = -2\\)\n\n   So, the expression inside the first parentheses evaluates to \\(-2\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   9 + -3 * -8 - -5\n   \\]\n   - First, perform the multiplication:\n     - \\(-3 * -8 = 24\\)\n   - Then, perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:\n     - \\(9 + 24 = 33\\)\n     - \\(33 - -5 = 33 + 5 = 38\\)\n\n   So, the expression inside the second parentheses evaluates to \\(38\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two evaluated expressions:**\n   \\[\n   (-2) * (38)\n   \\]\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     - \\(-2 * 38 = -76\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression \\(((5 * -2 + 8 * 1) * (9 + -3 * -8 - -5))\\) is \\(-76\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-76>>>"
