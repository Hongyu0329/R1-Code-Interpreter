    "To solve the expression \\(((9 - -6 * 9 * 4) - (6 - 4 * -8 * -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Identify and solve the innermost operations:**\n   - The expression contains two main parts within parentheses: \\((9 - -6 * 9 * 4)\\) and \\((6 - 4 * -8 * -7)\\).\n\n2. **Solve the multiplication within each set of parentheses:**\n   - For the first part: \\(-6 * 9 * 4\\)\n     - First, calculate \\(-6 * 9 = -54\\).\n     - Then, \\(-54 * 4 = -216\\).\n   - For the second part: \\(4 * -8 * -7\\)\n     - First, calculate \\(4 * -8 = -32\\).\n     - Then, \\(-32 * -7 = 224\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\((9 - -216) - (6 - 224)\\).\n\n4. **Solve the operations within each set of parentheses:**\n   - For the first part: \\(9 - -216\\)\n     - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding, so \\(9 + 216 = 225\\).\n   - For the second part: \\(6 - 224\\)\n     - This is a straightforward subtraction: \\(6 - 224 = -218\\).\n\n5. **Subtract the results of the two parts:**\n   - Now, the expression is \\(225 - (-218)\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding, so \\(225 + 218 = 443\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<443>>>"
