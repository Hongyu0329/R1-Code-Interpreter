    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) + (9 + -6 + -2 * 5))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-8 * 4 + 7 - 5)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-8 * 4 = -32\\).\n   - Next, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-32 + 7 = -25\\)\n     - \\(-25 - 5 = -30\\)\n\n   So, the expression \\((-8 * 4 + 7 - 5)\\) simplifies to \\(-30\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((9 + -6 + -2 * 5)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-2 * 5 = -10\\).\n   - Next, perform the addition from left to right:\n     - \\(9 + (-6) = 3\\)\n     - \\(3 + (-10) = -7\\)\n\n   So, the expression \\((9 + -6 + -2 * 5)\\) simplifies to \\(-7\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two sets of parentheses: \\((-30) + (-7)\\)**\n\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-30 + (-7) = -37\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression \\(((-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) + (9 + -6 + -2 * 5))\\) is \\(-37\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-37>>>."
