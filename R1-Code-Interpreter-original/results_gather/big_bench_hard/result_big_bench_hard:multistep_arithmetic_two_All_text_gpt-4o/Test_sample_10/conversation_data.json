    "To solve the expression \\(((6 - 0 \\times 5 + -3) \\times (6 - -7 + -2 - -7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - The expression has two sets of parentheses: \\((6 - 0 \\times 5 + -3)\\) and \\((6 - -7 + -2 - -7)\\).\n\n2. **First set of parentheses: \\((6 - 0 \\times 5 + -3)\\)**:\n   - Evaluate the multiplication: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(6 - 0 + -3\\).\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     - \\(6 - 0 = 6\\).\n     - \\(6 + -3 = 3\\).\n\n3. **Second set of parentheses: \\((6 - -7 + -2 - -7)\\)**:\n   - Simplify the double negatives: \n     - \\(-(-7) = +7\\).\n     - \\(-(-7) = +7\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(6 + 7 + -2 + 7\\).\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     - \\(6 + 7 = 13\\).\n     - \\(13 + -2 = 11\\).\n     - \\(11 + 7 = 18\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the results of the two sets of parentheses**:\n   - The results are \\(3\\) and \\(18\\).\n   - Multiply these results: \\(3 \\times 18 = 54\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<54>>>"
