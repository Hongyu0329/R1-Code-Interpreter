    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 - -9 * 8 - -9) + (-9 - 2 * -6 + -6))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-1 - -9 * 8 - -9)\\)**\n\n   - First, handle the multiplication: \\(-9 * 8 = -72\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-1 - (-72) - -9)\\).\n   - Simplify the double negatives: \\(-1 + 72 + 9\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-1 + 72 = 71\\).\n     - \\(71 + 9 = 80\\).\n\n   So, \\((-1 - -9 * 8 - -9) = 80\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((-9 - 2 * -6 + -6)\\)**\n\n   - First, handle the multiplication: \\(2 * -6 = -12\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-9 - (-12) + -6)\\).\n   - Simplify the double negatives: \\(-9 + 12 - 6\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-9 + 12 = 3\\).\n     - \\(3 - 6 = -3\\).\n\n   So, \\((-9 - 2 * -6 + -6) = -3\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two sets of parentheses:**\n\n   - Add the results: \\(80 + (-3)\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(80 - 3 = 77\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<77>>>"
