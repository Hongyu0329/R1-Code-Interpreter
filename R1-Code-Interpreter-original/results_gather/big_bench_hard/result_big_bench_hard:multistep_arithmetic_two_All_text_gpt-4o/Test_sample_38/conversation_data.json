    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + -6 * 9 - 7) + (8 + 2 * -9 * -7))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-8 + -6 * 9 - 7)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-6 * 9 = -54\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-8 + -54 - 7)\\).\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     - \\(-8 + -54 = -62\\).\n     - \\(-62 - 7 = -69\\).\n\n   So, the value of the first set of parentheses is \\(-69\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((8 + 2 * -9 * -7)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(2 * -9 = -18\\).\n   - Then, multiply the result by \\(-7\\): \\(-18 * -7 = 126\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((8 + 126)\\).\n   - Perform the addition: \\(8 + 126 = 134\\).\n\n   So, the value of the second set of parentheses is \\(134\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results of the two sets of parentheses: \\((-69) + (134)\\)**\n\n   - Perform the addition: \\(-69 + 134 = 65\\).\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<65>>>"
