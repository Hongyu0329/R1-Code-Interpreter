    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 8 - -7 * -2) - (-9 - 5 + 7 + 1))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the multiplication and negations:**\n   - The expression \\(-7 * -2\\) involves multiplying two negative numbers, which results in a positive number. Therefore, \\(-7 * -2 = 14\\).\n\n2. **Substitute the result back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\((-6 - 8 - 14) - (-9 - 5 + 7 + 1)\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the first part of the expression:**\n   - Calculate \\(-6 - 8 - 14\\):\n     - \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\)\n     - \\(-14 - 14 = -28\\)\n\n4. **Simplify the second part of the expression:**\n   - Calculate \\(-9 - 5 + 7 + 1\\):\n     - \\(-9 - 5 = -14\\)\n     - \\(-14 + 7 = -7\\)\n     - \\(-7 + 1 = -6\\)\n\n5. **Substitute the results back into the main expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes \\((-28) - (-6)\\).\n\n6. **Simplify the final expression:**\n   - Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number. Therefore, \\(-28 - (-6) = -28 + 6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(-28 + 6\\):\n     - \\(-28 + 6 = -22\\)\n\nThe final answer to the expression is \\(-22\\).\n\n<<<-22>>>"
