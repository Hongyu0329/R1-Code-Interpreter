    "To solve the expression \\(((5 - -2 * -9 + 8) - (3 - 4 * -3 - -6))\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((5 - -2 * -9 + 8)\\)**\n\n   - **Multiplication**: \\(-2 * -9 = 18\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(5 - 18 + 8\\)\n   - **Subtraction and Addition**: \n     - \\(5 - 18 = -13\\)\n     - \\(-13 + 8 = -5\\)\n\n   So, the value of the first set of parentheses is \\(-5\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((3 - 4 * -3 - -6)\\)**\n\n   - **Multiplication**: \\(4 * -3 = -12\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(3 - (-12) - -6\\)\n   - **Subtraction and Addition**:\n     - \\(3 - (-12) = 3 + 12 = 15\\)\n     - \\(15 - -6 = 15 + 6 = 21\\)\n\n   So, the value of the second set of parentheses is \\(21\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the second result from the first result**: \\((-5) - (21)\\)\n\n   - \\(-5 - 21 = -26\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-26\\).\n\n<<<-26>>>"
