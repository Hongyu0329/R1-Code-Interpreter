    "To solve the expression \\(((8 \\times 9 \\times 0 - -1) - (-9 - -7 + -4 - 8))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication and zero effect:**\n   - \\(8 \\times 9 \\times 0\\) results in \\(0\\) because any number multiplied by zero is zero.\n\n2. **Simplify the first part of the expression:**\n   - The expression becomes \\(0 - -1\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so \\(0 - -1 = 0 + 1 = 1\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the second part of the expression:**\n   - Evaluate \\(-9 - -7 + -4 - 8\\).\n   - Start with \\(-9 - -7\\): Subtracting a negative is adding the positive, so \\(-9 - -7 = -9 + 7 = -2\\).\n   - Now, \\(-2 + -4\\) is equivalent to \\(-2 - 4 = -6\\).\n   - Finally, \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\).\n\n4. **Combine the simplified parts:**\n   - The expression now is \\(1 - (-14)\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is adding the positive, so \\(1 - (-14) = 1 + 14 = 15\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<15>>>"
