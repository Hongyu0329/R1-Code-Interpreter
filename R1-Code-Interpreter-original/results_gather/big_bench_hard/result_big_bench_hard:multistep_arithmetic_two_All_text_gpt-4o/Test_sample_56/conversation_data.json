    "To solve the expression \\(((1 + 1 \\times 3 - 2) \\times (-8 - -2 - 9 + -9))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((1 + 1 \\times 3 - 2)\\).**\n   - According to PEMDAS, we first perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 3 = 3\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 - 2\n     \\]\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 = 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4 - 2 = 2\n     \\]\n   - The result of the first set of parentheses is \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((-8 - -2 - 9 + -9)\\).**\n   - Simplify the double negatives:\n     \\[\n     -8 + 2 - 9 - 9\n     \\]\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     \\[\n     -8 + 2 = -6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -6 - 9 = -15\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -15 - 9 = -24\n     \\]\n   - The result of the second set of parentheses is \\(-24\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses:**\n   - Multiply the results from steps 1 and 2:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times -24 = -48\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer to the expression is \\(-48\\).\n\n<<<-48>>>"
