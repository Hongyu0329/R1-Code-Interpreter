    "To solve the expression \\(((-4 + 4 + 3 \\times 1) - (-9 - -3 + -6 - 5))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -4 + 4 + 3 \\times 1\n   \\]\n   - First, perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 1 = 3\n     \\]\n   - Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     \\[\n     -4 + 4 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     0 + 3 = 3\n     \\]\n   So, the expression inside the first set of parentheses evaluates to 3.\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -9 - -3 + -6 - 5\n   \\]\n   - Simplify the double negatives:\n     \\[\n     -9 + 3 - 6 - 5\n     \\]\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     \\[\n     -9 + 3 = -6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -6 - 6 = -12\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -12 - 5 = -17\n     \\]\n   So, the expression inside the second set of parentheses evaluates to -17.\n\n3. **Subtract the result of the second set of parentheses from the result of the first set:**\n   \\[\n   3 - (-17)\n   \\]\n   - Simplify the subtraction of a negative number:\n     \\[\n     3 + 17 = 20\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
