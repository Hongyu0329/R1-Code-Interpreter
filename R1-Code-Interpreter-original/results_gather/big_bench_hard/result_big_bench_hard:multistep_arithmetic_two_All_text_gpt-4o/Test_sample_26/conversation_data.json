    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 - -9 + 0 + -3) + (-2 - -1 - 1 + 2))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-9 - -9 + 0 + -3)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-9 - -9\\) is equivalent to \\(-9 + 9\\), which equals \\(0\\).\n   - Now the expression becomes \\(0 + 0 + -3\\).\n   - \\(0 + 0\\) is \\(0\\).\n   - \\(0 + -3\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\n   So, the first part simplifies to \\(-3\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((-2 - -1 - 1 + 2)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-2 - -1\\) is equivalent to \\(-2 + 1\\), which equals \\(-1\\).\n   - Now the expression becomes \\(-1 - 1 + 2\\).\n   - \\(-1 - 1\\) is \\(-2\\).\n   - \\(-2 + 2\\) is \\(0\\).\n\n   So, the second part simplifies to \\(0\\).\n\n3. **Combine the simplified parts: \\((-3) + (0)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-3 + 0\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-3\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-3>>>."
