    "To solve the expression \\(((3 \\times 9 - 3 \\times 2) + (-1 \\times -7 - 1 - -9))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part of the expression: \\(3 \\times 9 - 3 \\times 2\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 9\\):\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 9 = 27\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(3 \\times 2\\):\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 2 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Subtract the results:\n     \\[\n     27 - 6 = 21\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part of the expression: \\(-1 \\times -7 - 1 - -9\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(-1 \\times -7\\):\n     \\[\n     -1 \\times -7 = 7\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 1:\n     \\[\n     7 - 1 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Subtract \\(-9\\) (which is equivalent to adding 9):\n     \\[\n     6 - (-9) = 6 + 9 = 15\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results from both parts:**\n   - Add the results from step 1 and step 2:\n     \\[\n     21 + 15 = 36\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<36>>>"
