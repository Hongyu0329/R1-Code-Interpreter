    "To solve the expression \\(((7 + 1 + 9 \\times 1) + (7 - -3 + 3 \\times 1))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost operations first:**\n   - In the first part of the expression, \\(9 \\times 1\\) is evaluated first because multiplication takes precedence over addition:\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 1 = 9\n     \\]\n   - In the second part of the expression, \\(3 \\times 1\\) is evaluated:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 1 = 3\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**\n   - The expression now becomes:\n     \\[\n     ((7 + 1 + 9) + (7 - -3 + 3))\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the additions and subtractions:**\n   - For the first part, \\(7 + 1 + 9\\):\n     \\[\n     7 + 1 = 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     8 + 9 = 17\n     \\]\n   - For the second part, \\(7 - -3 + 3\\):\n     - Note that subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive:\n     \\[\n     7 - -3 = 7 + 3 = 10\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     10 + 3 = 13\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the results of the two parts:**\n   - Add the results from the two parts:\n     \\[\n     17 + 13 = 30\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<30>>>"
