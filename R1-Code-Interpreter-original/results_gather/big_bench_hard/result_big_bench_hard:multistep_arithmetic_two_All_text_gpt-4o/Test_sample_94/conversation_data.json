    "To solve the expression \\(((-7 + 5 \\times -6 \\times -6) \\times (7 \\times -5 + -6 - 7))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate inside the parentheses**:\n   - First, solve the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-7 + 5 \\times -6 \\times -6)\\).\n     - Calculate the multiplication first: \\(5 \\times -6 = -30\\).\n     - Then, \\(-30 \\times -6 = 180\\).\n     - Now, add \\(-7\\) to \\(180\\): \\(-7 + 180 = 173\\).\n   - The result of the first parentheses is \\(173\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses**: \\((7 \\times -5 + -6 - 7)\\).\n   - Calculate the multiplication first: \\(7 \\times -5 = -35\\).\n   - Then, add \\(-6\\) to \\(-35\\): \\(-35 + -6 = -41\\).\n   - Finally, subtract \\(7\\): \\(-41 - 7 = -48\\).\n   - The result of the second parentheses is \\(-48\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses**:\n   - Multiply \\(173\\) by \\(-48\\): \\(173 \\times -48 = -8304\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-8304>>>"
