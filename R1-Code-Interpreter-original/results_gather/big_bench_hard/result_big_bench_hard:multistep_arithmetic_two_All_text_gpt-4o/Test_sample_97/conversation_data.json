    "To solve the expression \\(((5 - 6 - 7 + 6) - (-1 - 1 \\times -7 + 9))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   5 - 6 - 7 + 6\n   \\]\n   - Start with \\(5 - 6 = -1\\).\n   - Then, \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\).\n   - Finally, \\(-8 + 6 = -2\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the first set of parentheses evaluates to \\(-2\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -1 - 1 \\times -7 + 9\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(1 \\times -7 = -7\\).\n   - Then, \\(-1 - (-7) = -1 + 7 = 6\\).\n   - Finally, \\(6 + 9 = 15\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the second set of parentheses evaluates to \\(15\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the result of the second set of parentheses from the result of the first set:**\n   \\[\n   -2 - 15\n   \\]\n   - This simplifies to \\(-2 - 15 = -17\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-17\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-17>>>"
