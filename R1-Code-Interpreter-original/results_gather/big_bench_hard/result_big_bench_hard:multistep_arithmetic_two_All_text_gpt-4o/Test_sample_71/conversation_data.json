    "To solve the expression \\(((9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8) + (6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part of the expression: \\((9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8)\\)**\n\n   - Calculate \\(9 \\times 4\\):\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 4 = 36\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract 6 from 36:\n     \\[\n     36 - 6 = 30\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract \\(-8\\) (which is equivalent to adding 8) from 30:\n     \\[\n     30 - (-8) = 30 + 8 = 38\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part of the expression: \\((6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3)\\)**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-4 \\times 3\\):\n     \\[\n     -4 \\times 3 = -12\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract 8 from 6:\n     \\[\n     6 - 8 = -2\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract \\(-12\\) (which is equivalent to adding 12) from \\(-2\\):\n     \\[\n     -2 - (-12) = -2 + 12 = 10\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the results of the two parts together:**\n\n   - Add 38 and 10:\n     \\[\n     38 + 10 = 48\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression \\(((9 \\times 4 - 6 - -8) + (6 - 8 - -4 \\times 3))\\) is:\n\n<<<48>>>"
