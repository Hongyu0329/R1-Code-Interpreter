    "To solve the expression \\(((2 - -2 + -7 * 8) * (-7 * -8 * 3 - -2))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve the expressions inside the parentheses first.\n\n   - For the first set of parentheses: \\(2 - -2 + -7 * 8\\)\n     - Handle the double negative: \\(2 - -2 = 2 + 2 = 4\\)\n     - Next, perform the multiplication: \\(-7 * 8 = -56\\)\n     - Now, add the results: \\(4 + (-56) = 4 - 56 = -52\\)\n\n   - For the second set of parentheses: \\(-7 * -8 * 3 - -2\\)\n     - First, perform the multiplications: \\(-7 * -8 = 56\\) and then \\(56 * 3 = 168\\)\n     - Handle the double negative: \\(- -2 = +2\\)\n     - Now, subtract: \\(168 + 2 = 170\\)\n\n2. **Multiplication**: Now that we have simplified the expressions inside the parentheses, multiply the results of the two sets of parentheses.\n\n   - Multiply the results: \\((-52) * 170\\)\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: Perform the multiplication.\n   - \\(-52 * 170 = -8840\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-8840>>>"
