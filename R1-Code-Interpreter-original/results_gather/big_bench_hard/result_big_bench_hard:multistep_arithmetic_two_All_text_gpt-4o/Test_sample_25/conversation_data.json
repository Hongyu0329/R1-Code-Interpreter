    "To solve the expression \\(((6 + 1 - 4 - 3) - (-4 \\times -6 \\times -3 + 1))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   6 + 1 - 4 - 3\n   \\]\n   - Start with \\(6 + 1 = 7\\).\n   - Then, \\(7 - 4 = 3\\).\n   - Finally, \\(3 - 3 = 0\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the first set of parentheses evaluates to \\(0\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -4 \\times -6 \\times -3 + 1\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate \\(-4 \\times -6\\):\n     - \\(-4 \\times -6 = 24\\) (since multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result).\n   - Next, multiply the result by \\(-3\\):\n     - \\(24 \\times -3 = -72\\) (since multiplying a positive number by a negative number gives a negative result).\n   - Finally, add \\(1\\) to \\(-72\\):\n     - \\(-72 + 1 = -71\\).\n\n   So, the expression inside the second set of parentheses evaluates to \\(-71\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the result of the second set of parentheses from the result of the first set:**\n   \\[\n   0 - (-71)\n   \\]\n   - Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding the positive of that number:\n     - \\(0 - (-71) = 0 + 71 = 71\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{71}\n\\]\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<71>>>"
