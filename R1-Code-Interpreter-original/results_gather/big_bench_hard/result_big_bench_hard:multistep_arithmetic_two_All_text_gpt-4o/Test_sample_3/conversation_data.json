    "To solve the expression \\(((6 * -6 * 8 * 1) * (-1 * 7 * -6 + -2))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part of the expression: \\(6 * -6 * 8 * 1\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(6 * -6 = -36\\).\n   - Multiply the result by 8: \\(-36 * 8 = -288\\).\n   - Multiply the result by 1: \\(-288 * 1 = -288\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part of the expression: \\(-1 * 7 * -6 + -2\\)**\n   - Calculate \\(-1 * 7 = -7\\).\n   - Multiply the result by \\(-6\\): \\(-7 * -6 = 42\\).\n   - Add \\(-2\\) to the result: \\(42 + -2 = 40\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two parts:**\n   - Multiply the result of the first part by the result of the second part: \\(-288 * 40\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the final result:**\n   - \\(-288 * 40 = -11520\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-11520>>>"
