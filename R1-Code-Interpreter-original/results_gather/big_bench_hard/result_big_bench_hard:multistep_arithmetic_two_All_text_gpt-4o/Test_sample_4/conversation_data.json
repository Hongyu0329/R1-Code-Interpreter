    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - -4 + 9 + 0) + (1 + -4 - -9 * 6))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-6 - -4 + 9 + 0)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-6 - -4\\) is equivalent to \\(-6 + 4\\), which equals \\(-2\\).\n   - \\(-2 + 9\\) equals \\(7\\).\n   - \\(7 + 0\\) equals \\(7\\).\n\n   So, the first part simplifies to \\(7\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((1 + -4 - -9 * 6)\\)**\n\n   - \\(-9 * 6\\) equals \\(-54\\).\n   - \\(- -54\\) is equivalent to \\(+54\\).\n   - \\(1 + -4\\) equals \\(-3\\).\n   - \\(-3 + 54\\) equals \\(51\\).\n\n   So, the second part simplifies to \\(51\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from both parts:**\n\n   - \\(7 + 51\\) equals \\(58\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<58>>>"
