    "To solve the expression \\(((1 + 3 - -5 - 4) + (-3 - -3 + 6 * 9))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((1 + 3 - -5 - 4)\\)**\n   - Start with \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n   - Next, handle the double negative: \\(- -5\\) becomes \\(+5\\).\n   - So, \\(4 + 5 = 9\\).\n   - Finally, subtract 4: \\(9 - 4 = 5\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((-3 - -3 + 6 * 9)\\)**\n   - Handle the double negative: \\(- -3\\) becomes \\(+3\\).\n   - So, \\(-3 + 3 = 0\\).\n   - Next, calculate the multiplication: \\(6 * 9 = 54\\).\n   - Add the result to the previous sum: \\(0 + 54 = 54\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results from both parts:**\n   - Add the results from step 1 and step 2: \\(5 + 54 = 59\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<59>>>"
