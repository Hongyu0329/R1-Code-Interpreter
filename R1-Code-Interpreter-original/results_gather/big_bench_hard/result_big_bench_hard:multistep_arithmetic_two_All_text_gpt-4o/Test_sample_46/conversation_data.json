    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 0 \\times 0 \\times -1) - (7 + -1 + -3 \\times -2))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   -8 + 0 \\times 0 \\times -1\n   \\]\n   - The multiplication part \\(0 \\times 0 \\times -1\\) is evaluated first. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, this simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     0\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the expression becomes:\n     \\[\n     -8 + 0 = -8\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   7 + -1 + -3 \\times -2\n   \\]\n   - The multiplication part \\(-3 \\times -2\\) is evaluated first. Multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number:\n     \\[\n     -3 \\times -2 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     7 + -1 + 6\n     \\]\n   - Perform the addition/subtraction from left to right:\n     \\[\n     7 + -1 = 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     6 + 6 = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two evaluated expressions:**\n   \\[\n   (-8) - (12)\n   \\]\n   - Subtracting 12 from -8:\n     \\[\n     -8 - 12 = -20\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer to the expression is \\(-20\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n<<<-20>>>"
