    "To solve the expression \\(((6 - 1 - -3 + -2) + (5 * 5 + -1 - -8))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the first part of the expression: \\((6 - 1 - -3 + -2)\\)**\n   - Start with \\(6 - 1\\):\n     \\[\n     6 - 1 = 5\n     \\]\n   - Next, subtract \\(-3\\) (which is equivalent to adding 3):\n     \\[\n     5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8\n     \\]\n   - Finally, add \\(-2\\) (which is equivalent to subtracting 2):\n     \\[\n     8 + (-2) = 8 - 2 = 6\n     \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part of the expression: \\((5 * 5 + -1 - -8)\\)**\n   - Start with \\(5 * 5\\):\n     \\[\n     5 * 5 = 25\n     \\]\n   - Next, add \\(-1\\) (which is equivalent to subtracting 1):\n     \\[\n     25 + (-1) = 25 - 1 = 24\n     \\]\n   - Finally, subtract \\(-8\\) (which is equivalent to adding 8):\n     \\[\n     24 - (-8) = 24 + 8 = 32\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two parts:**\n   - Add the results from step 1 and step 2:\n     \\[\n     6 + 32 = 38\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<38>>>"
