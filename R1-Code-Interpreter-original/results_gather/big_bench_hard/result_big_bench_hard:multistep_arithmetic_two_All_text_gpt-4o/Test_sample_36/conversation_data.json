    "To solve the expression \\(((-5 + 6 - -5 + -6) + (-4 + -6 - 3 - 7))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first set of parentheses: \\((-5 + 6 - -5 + -6)\\)**\n   - Start with \\(-5 + 6\\): \n     \\[\n     -5 + 6 = 1\n     \\]\n   - Next, handle the \\(- -5\\) which is equivalent to \\(+5\\):\n     \\[\n     1 + 5 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Finally, add \\(-6\\):\n     \\[\n     6 - 6 = 0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the second set of parentheses: \\((-4 + -6 - 3 - 7)\\)**\n   - Start with \\(-4 + -6\\):\n     \\[\n     -4 - 6 = -10\n     \\]\n   - Next, subtract 3:\n     \\[\n     -10 - 3 = -13\n     \\]\n   - Finally, subtract 7:\n     \\[\n     -13 - 7 = -20\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results from both sets of parentheses:**\n   - Add the results from step 1 and step 2:\n     \\[\n     0 + (-20) = -20\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-20>>>"
