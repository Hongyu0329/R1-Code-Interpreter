    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 + -3 + 6 - 8) - (-7 * -2 * -6 + -6))\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost parentheses first:**\n\n   \\((-9 + -3 + 6 - 8)\\)\n\n   - Calculate \\(-9 + -3 = -12\\)\n   - Then, \\(-12 + 6 = -6\\)\n   - Finally, \\(-6 - 8 = -14\\)\n\n   So, the expression inside the first set of parentheses evaluates to \\(-14\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses:**\n\n   \\((-7 * -2 * -6 + -6)\\)\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \\(-7 * -2 = 14\\)\n   - Then, \\(14 * -6 = -84\\)\n   - Now, add \\(-84 + -6 = -90\\)\n\n   So, the expression inside the second set of parentheses evaluates to \\(-90\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the evaluated expressions back into the main expression:**\n\n   \\((-14) - (-90)\\)\n\n4. **Simplify the expression:**\n\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive: \\(-14 + 90\\)\n\n5. **Perform the addition:**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-14 + 90 = 76\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<76>>>"
