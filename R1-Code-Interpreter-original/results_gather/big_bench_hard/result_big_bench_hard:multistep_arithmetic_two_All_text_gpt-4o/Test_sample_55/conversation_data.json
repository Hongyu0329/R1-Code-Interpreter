    "To solve the expression \\(((1 + 1 + -7 * -6) - (4 * 2 * -5 + -5))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   - The expression is \\(1 + 1 + -7 * -6\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(-7 * -6\\):\n     \\[\n     -7 * -6 = 42\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     1 + 1 + 42\n     \\]\n   - Add the numbers:\n     \\[\n     1 + 1 = 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2 + 42 = 44\n     \\]\n   - So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(44\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   - The expression is \\(4 * 2 * -5 + -5\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(4 * 2\\):\n     \\[\n     4 * 2 = 8\n     \\]\n   - Then, calculate \\(8 * -5\\):\n     \\[\n     8 * -5 = -40\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     -40 + -5\n     \\]\n   - Add the numbers:\n     \\[\n     -40 + -5 = -45\n     \\]\n   - So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(-45\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses:**\n   - The expression is \\(44 - (-45)\\).\n   - Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive:\n     \\[\n     44 + 45 = 89\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<89>>>"
