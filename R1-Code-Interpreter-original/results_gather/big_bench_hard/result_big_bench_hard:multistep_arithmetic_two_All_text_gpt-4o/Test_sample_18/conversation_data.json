    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 - 6 + 7 - 7) - (5 + 3 - 9 \\times -8))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expressions:**\n   - The first part is \\((-6 - 6 + 7 - 7)\\).\n     - Start with \\(-6 - 6 = -12\\).\n     - Then, \\(-12 + 7 = -5\\).\n     - Finally, \\(-5 - 7 = -12\\).\n   - So, \\((-6 - 6 + 7 - 7) = -12\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the second part:**\n   - The second part is \\((5 + 3 - 9 \\times -8)\\).\n     - First, calculate the multiplication: \\(-9 \\times -8 = 72\\).\n     - Then, add and subtract in sequence: \\(5 + 3 = 8\\).\n     - Finally, \\(8 + 72 = 80\\).\n   - So, \\((5 + 3 - 9 \\times -8) = 80\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   - Now, substitute the evaluated parts back into the main expression:\n     - \\((-12) - (80)\\).\n     - Calculate: \\(-12 - 80 = -92\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-92>>>"
