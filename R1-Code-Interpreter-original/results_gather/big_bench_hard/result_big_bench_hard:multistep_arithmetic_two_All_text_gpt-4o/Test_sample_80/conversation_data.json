    "To solve the expression \\(((-6 + -2 * 3 * 0) + (3 + -4 - 7 - -4))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the multiplication inside the first set of parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the first set of parentheses is \\((-6 + -2 * 3 * 0)\\).\n   - According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we first perform the multiplication: \\(-2 * 3 * 0\\).\n   - \\(-2 * 3 = -6\\).\n   - \\(-6 * 0 = 0\\).\n   - So, the expression becomes \\((-6 + 0)\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the first set of parentheses:**\n   - Now, simplify \\((-6 + 0)\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(-6\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:**\n   - The expression inside the second set of parentheses is \\((3 + -4 - 7 - -4)\\).\n   - Simplify step by step:\n     - \\(3 + -4 = -1\\).\n     - \\(-1 - 7 = -8\\).\n     - \\(-8 - -4 = -8 + 4 = -4\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results from both sets of parentheses:**\n   - Now, combine the results from both sets of parentheses: \\((-6) + (-4)\\).\n   - Simplify: \\(-6 + -4 = -10\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-10>>>"
