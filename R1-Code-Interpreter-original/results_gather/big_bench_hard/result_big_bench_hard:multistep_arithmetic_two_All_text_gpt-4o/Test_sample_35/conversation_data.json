    "To solve the expression \\(((-1 + -7 + -2 - 7) * (6 - 1 - -1 * 5))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-1 + -7 + -2 - 7)\\)**\n\n   - Start with \\(-1 + -7\\): \n     \\[\n     -1 + -7 = -8\n     \\]\n\n   - Add \\(-2\\) to the result:\n     \\[\n     -8 + -2 = -10\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract \\(7\\) from the result:\n     \\[\n     -10 - 7 = -17\n     \\]\n\n   So, the simplified result of the first part is \\(-17\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((6 - 1 - -1 * 5)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication \\(-1 * 5\\):\n     \\[\n     -1 * 5 = -5\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute the result into the expression:\n     \\[\n     6 - 1 - (-5)\n     \\]\n\n   - Simplify the subtraction of a negative number:\n     \\[\n     6 - 1 + 5\n     \\]\n\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     \\[\n     6 - 1 = 5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5 + 5 = 10\n     \\]\n\n   So, the simplified result of the second part is \\(10\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two parts: \\((-17) * (10)\\)**\n\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     -17 * 10 = -170\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is \\(-170\\).\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<-170>>>"
