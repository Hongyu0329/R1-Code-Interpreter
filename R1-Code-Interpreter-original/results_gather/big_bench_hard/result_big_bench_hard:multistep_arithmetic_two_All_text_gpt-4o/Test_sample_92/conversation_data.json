    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 * 4 * -9 - -9) * (5 * 2 * 6 * -2))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expressions first:**\n\n   - Calculate \\(-9 * 4 * -9\\):\n     - First, \\(-9 * 4 = -36\\).\n     - Then, \\(-36 * -9 = 324\\).\n\n   - The expression now becomes \\((324 - -9)\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the expression \\(324 - -9\\):**\n\n   - Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive, so:\n     - \\(324 - -9 = 324 + 9 = 333\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the second part of the expression:**\n\n   - Calculate \\(5 * 2 * 6 * -2\\):\n     - First, \\(5 * 2 = 10\\).\n     - Then, \\(10 * 6 = 60\\).\n     - Finally, \\(60 * -2 = -120\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results from the two parts:**\n\n   - Now, multiply the results from the two parts:\n     - \\((333) * (-120)\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the final result:**\n\n   - \\(333 * -120 = -39960\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-39960>>>"
