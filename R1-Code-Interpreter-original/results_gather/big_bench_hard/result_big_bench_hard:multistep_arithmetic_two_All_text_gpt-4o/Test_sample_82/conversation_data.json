    "To solve the expression \\(((-8 + 6 - 8 \\times -9) - (9 - 9 \\times -2 + -1))\\), we will break it down step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-8 + 6 - 8 \\times -9)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication: \n     \\[\n     -8 \\times -9 = 72\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     -8 + 6 + 72\n     \\]\n\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     \\[\n     -8 + 6 = -2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -2 + 72 = 70\n     \\]\n\n   So, the result of the first set of parentheses is \\(70\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \\((9 - 9 \\times -2 + -1)\\)**\n\n   - First, perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     9 \\times -2 = -18\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute back into the expression:\n     \\[\n     9 + 18 - 1\n     \\]\n\n   - Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n     \\[\n     9 + 18 = 27\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     27 - 1 = 26\n     \\]\n\n   So, the result of the second set of parentheses is \\(26\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the results of the two parentheses:**\n\n   - Substitute the results back into the main expression:\n     \\[\n     70 - 26\n     \\]\n\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     70 - 26 = 44\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<44>>>"
