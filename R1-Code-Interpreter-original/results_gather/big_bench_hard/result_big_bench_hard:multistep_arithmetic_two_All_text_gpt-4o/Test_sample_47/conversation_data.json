    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 - -3 * 1 - -3) * (-9 - 5 - -2 * -7))\\), we need to carefully follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. **Simplify inside the first set of parentheses: \\((-9 - -3 * 1 - -3)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(-3 * 1 = -3\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-9 - -3 - -3)\\).\n   - Simplify the subtraction of negative numbers:\n     - \\(-9 - -3\\) becomes \\(-9 + 3 = -6\\).\n     - \\(-6 - -3\\) becomes \\(-6 + 3 = -3\\).\n\n   So, the simplified expression inside the first parentheses is \\(-3\\).\n\n2. **Simplify inside the second set of parentheses: \\((-9 - 5 - -2 * -7)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(-2 * -7 = 14\\).\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\((-9 - 5 - 14)\\).\n   - Perform the operations from left to right:\n     - \\(-9 - 5 = -14\\).\n     - \\(-14 - 14 = -28\\).\n\n   So, the simplified expression inside the second parentheses is \\(-28\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the results of the two simplified expressions: \\((-3) * (-28)\\)**\n\n   - Multiply the two results: \\(-3 * -28 = 84\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<84>>>"
