    "To solve the expression \\(((-9 + 8 - -4 * 2) - (1 - 9 + -6 * 3))\\), we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Simplify the first part of the expression: \\((-9 + 8 - -4 * 2)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(-4 * 2 = -8\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-9 + 8 - (-8)\\)\n   - Simplify the addition and subtraction:\n     - \\(-9 + 8 = -1\\)\n     - \\(-1 - (-8) = -1 + 8 = 7\\)\n\n2. **Simplify the second part of the expression: \\((1 - 9 + -6 * 3)\\)**\n\n   - Start with the multiplication: \\(-6 * 3 = -18\\)\n   - Substitute back into the expression: \\(1 - 9 + (-18)\\)\n   - Simplify the addition and subtraction:\n     - \\(1 - 9 = -8\\)\n     - \\(-8 + (-18) = -8 - 18 = -26\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results from the two parts:**\n\n   - The expression becomes: \\(7 - (-26)\\)\n   - Simplify the subtraction: \\(7 + 26 = 33\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<33>>>"
