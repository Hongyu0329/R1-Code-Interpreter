    "To solve the expression \\(((1 - 7 - -8 * 3) + (-7 - -2 + -3 * 6))\\), we will break it down step by step, carefully considering the order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction).\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost expressions first:**\n\n   - Inside the first set of parentheses: \\(1 - 7 - -8 * 3\\)\n     - Evaluate the multiplication: \\(-8 * 3 = -24\\)\n     - Substitute back into the expression: \\(1 - 7 - (-24)\\)\n     - Simplify the subtraction of a negative: \\(1 - 7 + 24\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right:\n       - \\(1 - 7 = -6\\)\n       - \\(-6 + 24 = 18\\)\n\n2. **Evaluate the second set of parentheses:**\n\n   - Inside the second set of parentheses: \\(-7 - -2 + -3 * 6\\)\n     - Evaluate the multiplication: \\(-3 * 6 = -18\\)\n     - Substitute back into the expression: \\(-7 - (-2) + (-18)\\)\n     - Simplify the subtraction of a negative: \\(-7 + 2 - 18\\)\n     - Perform the operations from left to right:\n       - \\(-7 + 2 = -5\\)\n       - \\(-5 - 18 = -23\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results from both sets of parentheses:**\n\n   - The expression now becomes: \\(18 + (-23)\\)\n   - Perform the addition: \\(18 - 23 = -5\\)\n\nThus, the final answer to the expression is:\n\n<<<-5>>>"
