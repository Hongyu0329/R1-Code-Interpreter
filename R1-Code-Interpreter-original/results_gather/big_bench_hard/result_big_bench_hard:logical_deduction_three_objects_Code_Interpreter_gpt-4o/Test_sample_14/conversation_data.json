    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The convertible is older than the tractor.\n2. The hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that the hatchback is neither the oldest nor the newest. Therefore, it must be in the middle in terms of age.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orderings:\n\n- If the convertible is the oldest, then the order would be: Convertible, Hatchback, Tractor.\n- If the tractor is the oldest, then the order would be: Tractor, Hatchback, Convertible.\n\nHowever, point 1 states that the convertible is older than the tractor, so the second scenario is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent ordering is: Convertible, Hatchback, Tractor.\n\nThus, the hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nThe correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
