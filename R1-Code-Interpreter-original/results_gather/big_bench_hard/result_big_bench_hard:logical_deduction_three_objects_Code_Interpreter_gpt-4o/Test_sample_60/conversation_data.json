    "\nassistant > Given the information:\n\n1. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n2. The minivan is the second-newest.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that the minivan is not the newest, so it must be older than at least one other vehicle. Since the minivan is older than the tractor, the tractor must be the newest. Therefore, the motorcycle must be the oldest.\n\nThus, the order from oldest to newest is: Motorcycle, Minivan, Tractor.\n\nThe minivan is indeed the second-newest, which matches option (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
