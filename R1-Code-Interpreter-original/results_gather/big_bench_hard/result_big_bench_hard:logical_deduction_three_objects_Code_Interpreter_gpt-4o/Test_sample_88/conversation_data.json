    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that watermelons are neither the cheapest nor the most expensive. Therefore, they must be in the middle in terms of price.\n\nFrom statement 2, since loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes, loquats cannot be the cheapest.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, the only possibility is:\n\n- Loquats are the most expensive.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- Cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C) The cantaloupes are the cheapest>>>"
