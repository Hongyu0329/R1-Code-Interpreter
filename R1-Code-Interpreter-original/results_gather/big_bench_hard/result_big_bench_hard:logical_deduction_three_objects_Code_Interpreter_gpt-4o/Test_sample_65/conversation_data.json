    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given information:\n\n1. The tractor is the second-newest.\n2. The minivan is newer than the convertible.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- Since the tractor is the second-newest, it cannot be the newest or the oldest. Therefore, it must be in the middle position.\n- The minivan is newer than the convertible, so the minivan cannot be the oldest.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order is:\n- Newest: Minivan\n- Second-newest: Tractor\n- Oldest: Convertible\n\nTherefore, the minivan is the newest, the tractor is the second-newest, and the convertible is the oldest.\n\nThe correct option is (A) The tractor is the second-newest.\n\n<<<A>>>"
