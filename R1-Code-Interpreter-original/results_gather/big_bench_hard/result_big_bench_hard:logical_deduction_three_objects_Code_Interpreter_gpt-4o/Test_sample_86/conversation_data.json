The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n\nFrom statement 1, the red book is in the third position (rightmost).\n\nFrom statement 2, the blue book must be to the right of the green book. Since the red book is already in the rightmost position, the blue book must be in the second position, and the green book must be in the first position.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is: Green Book, Blue Book, Red Book.\n\nThis means the blue book is the second from the left.\n\nThe correct option is (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
