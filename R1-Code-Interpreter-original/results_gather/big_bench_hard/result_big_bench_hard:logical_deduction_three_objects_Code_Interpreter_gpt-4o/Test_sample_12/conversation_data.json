    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is to the right of the falcon.\n2. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n\nLet's analyze the possible arrangements:\n\n- Since the blue jay is to the right of the falcon, the falcon cannot be the rightmost bird.\n- Since the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon, the falcon cannot be the leftmost bird.\n\nThis means the falcon must be in the middle position. Therefore, the order from left to right is: Hummingbird, Falcon, Blue Jay.\n\nThus, the falcon is the second from the left.\n\nThe correct option is (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
