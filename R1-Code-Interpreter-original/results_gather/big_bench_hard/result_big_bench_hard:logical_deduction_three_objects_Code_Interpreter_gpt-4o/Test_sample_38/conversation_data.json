    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. There are three birds: a hawk, a crow, and a raven.\n2. The raven is to the right of the hawk.\n3. The crow is the rightmost.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the order of the birds:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it must be in the third position.\n- The raven is to the right of the hawk, so the raven cannot be in the first position. Therefore, the raven must be in the second position.\n- This leaves the hawk in the first position.\n\nThe order of the birds is: Hawk, Raven, Crow.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The hawk is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the hawk is the first from the left.\n(B) The crow is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the crow is the third from the left.\n(C) The raven is the second from the left - This is correct because the raven is indeed in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
