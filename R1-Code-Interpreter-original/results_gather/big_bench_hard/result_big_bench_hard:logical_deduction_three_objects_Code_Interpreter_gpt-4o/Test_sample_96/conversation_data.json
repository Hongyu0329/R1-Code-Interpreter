    "\nassistant > Given the statements:\n\n1. The hawk is to the left of the cardinal.\n2. The hawk is the second from the left.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know the hawk is in the second position. Since the hawk is to the left of the cardinal, the cardinal must be in the third position. This leaves the first position for the falcon.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is: Falcon, Hawk, Cardinal.\n\nThe hawk is indeed the second from the left, which corresponds to option (A).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
