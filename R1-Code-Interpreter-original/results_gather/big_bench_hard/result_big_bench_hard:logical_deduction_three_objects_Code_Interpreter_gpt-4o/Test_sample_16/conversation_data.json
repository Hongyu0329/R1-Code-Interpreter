    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The watermelons are less expensive than the kiwis.\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the kiwis are not the most expensive, but they are more expensive than at least one other fruit. Since the watermelons are less expensive than the kiwis (statement 1), the watermelons must be the least expensive.\n\nThis leaves the mangoes as the only option to be the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
