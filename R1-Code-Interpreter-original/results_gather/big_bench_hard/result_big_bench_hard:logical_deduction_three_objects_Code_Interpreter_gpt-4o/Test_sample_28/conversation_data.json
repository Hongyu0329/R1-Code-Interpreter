    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. There are three birds: a hummingbird, a blue jay, and a raven.\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\n3. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the positions of the birds:\n\n- Since the raven is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n- The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird, so the hummingbird cannot be in the rightmost position.\n\nThus, the only possible arrangement is:\n1. Hummingbird (leftmost)\n2. Raven (middle)\n3. Blue jay (rightmost)\n\nTherefore, the blue jay is the rightmost bird.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<<<B>>>"
