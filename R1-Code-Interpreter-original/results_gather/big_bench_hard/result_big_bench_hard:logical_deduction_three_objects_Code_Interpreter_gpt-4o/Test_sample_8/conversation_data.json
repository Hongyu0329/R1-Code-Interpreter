    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The orange book is the second from the left.\n2. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the orange book is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n- The blue book must be to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be on the leftmost position, and the blue book must be on the rightmost position.\n\nTherefore, the order from left to right is: Yellow, Orange, Blue.\n\nThe statement that matches this order is:\n(A) The orange book is the second from the left.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
