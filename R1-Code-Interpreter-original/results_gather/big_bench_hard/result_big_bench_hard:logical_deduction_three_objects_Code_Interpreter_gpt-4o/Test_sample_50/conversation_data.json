    "\nassistant > Given the arrangement:\n\n1. The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n2. The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the order of the books on the shelf:\n\n- The orange book is to the left of the blue book, so the orange book is not the rightmost.\n- The yellow book is to the right of the blue book, so the yellow book is not the leftmost.\n- Therefore, the blue book must be between the orange and yellow books.\n\nThe only logical order that satisfies these conditions is: Orange book, Blue book, Yellow book.\n\nThus, the orange book is the leftmost.\n\nThe correct option is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
