    "\nassistant > To solve this, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Kiwis are less expensive than loquats.\n   - This implies: Kiwis < Loquats\n\n2. Cantaloupes are less expensive than kiwis.\n   - This implies: Cantaloupes < Kiwis\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can deduce the order of the fruits from least expensive to most expensive:\n\n- Cantaloupes < Kiwis < Loquats\n\nNow, let's determine which fruit is the second-most expensive:\n\n- The order is: Cantaloupes, Kiwis, Loquats\n- The second-most expensive fruit is Kiwis.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<A>>>"
