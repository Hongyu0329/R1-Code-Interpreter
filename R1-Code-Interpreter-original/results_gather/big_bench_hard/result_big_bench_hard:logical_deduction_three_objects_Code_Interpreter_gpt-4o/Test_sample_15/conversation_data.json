    "\nassistant > To determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, we can analyze the given statements:\n\n1. The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n2. The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that watermelons are neither the cheapest nor the most expensive. Therefore, they must be in the middle position in terms of price.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes. This means loquats cannot be the cheapest.\n\nGiven these two statements, the only logical order is:\n- Loquats are the most expensive.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- Cantaloupes are the least expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The loquats are the most expensive.\n\n<<<A>>>"
