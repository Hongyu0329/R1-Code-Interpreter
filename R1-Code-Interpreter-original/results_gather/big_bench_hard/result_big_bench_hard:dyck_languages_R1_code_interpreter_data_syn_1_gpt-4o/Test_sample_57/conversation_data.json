    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of opening and closing brackets. The input sequence is `< > {`. \n\n1. The sequence starts with `<`, which is an opening bracket. It should be closed with `>`.\n2. The next character is `>`, which is a closing bracket for the first `<`.\n3. The sequence then has `{`, which is an opening bracket. It should be closed with `}`.\n\nThe sequence is already partially closed, but we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n- `<` is closed by `>`.\n- `{` is not yet closed.\n\nTherefore, we need to add a `}` to close the `{`.\n\nThe complete sequence with properly closed brackets should be `< > { }`.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the sequence is balanced and properly closed.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[', '>': '<'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\nsequence = \"<>{}\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code checks if the sequence is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. If the sequence is balanced, it will return `True`.\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the sequence.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence `<>{}` is balanced and properly closed. This confirms our reasoning that the sequence is complete and correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer < > { } >>>"
