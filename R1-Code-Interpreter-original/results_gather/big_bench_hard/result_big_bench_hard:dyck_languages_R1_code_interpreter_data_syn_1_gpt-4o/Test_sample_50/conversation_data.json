    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\nInput: ( < > ( [ ( )\n\nWe need to determine the correct sequence of closing brackets to match the opening brackets. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis. We need a `)` to close it.\n2. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket. We need a `>` to close it.\n3. `>` - This is a closing angle bracket. It matches the previous `<`.\n4. `(` - This is another opening parenthesis. We need a `)` to close it.\n5. `[` - This is an opening square bracket. We need a `]` to close it.\n6. `(` - This is another opening parenthesis. We need a `)` to close it.\n7. `)` - This is a closing parenthesis. It matches the last `(`.\n\nNow, let's determine the remaining closing brackets needed:\n\n- The first `(` needs a `)`.\n- The second `(` needs a `)`.\n- The `[` needs a `]`.\n\nThe sequence of closing brackets should be `) ] ) )`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and verify the sequence:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    stack = []\n    closing_brackets = { '(': ')', '[': ']', '<': '>' }\n    result = []\n\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in closing_brackets:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in closing_brackets.values():\n            if stack and closing_brackets[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    while stack:\n        result.append(closing_brackets[stack.pop()])\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n\ninput_sequence = \"(<>([()\"\noutput = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the correct sequence of closing brackets needed to complete the input sequence. Let's execute it to find the answer.",

This indicates that the sequence of closing brackets needed to complete the input sequence is `]))`.\n\nLet's verify the reasoning:\n\n1. The first `(` needs a `)`.\n2. The second `(` needs a `)`.\n3. The `[` needs a `]`.\n\nThe sequence of closing brackets should be `]))`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<]))>>>"
