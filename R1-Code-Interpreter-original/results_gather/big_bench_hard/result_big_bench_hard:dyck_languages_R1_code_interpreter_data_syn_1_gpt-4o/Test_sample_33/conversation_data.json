    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n`< ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) )`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` is an opening angle bracket, so it needs a closing `>`.\n2. `(` is an opening parenthesis, so it needs a closing `)`.\n3. Another `(` is an opening parenthesis, so it needs a closing `)`.\n4. `[` is an opening square bracket, so it needs a closing `]`.\n5. Another `(` is an opening parenthesis, so it needs a closing `)`.\n6. `[` is an opening square bracket, so it needs a closing `]`.\n7. `]` is a closing square bracket, which matches the last opened `[`.\n8. `)` is a closing parenthesis, which matches the last opened `(`.\n9. `]` is a closing square bracket, which matches the last opened `[`.\n10. `)` is a closing parenthesis, which matches the last opened `(`.\n11. `)` is a closing parenthesis, which matches the last opened `(`.\n\nNow, we need to close the initial `<` with a `>`.\n\nThe sequence should be completed as:\n\n`< ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) ) >`\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's use a stack-based approach to verify the sequence and generate the missing closing brackets.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    opening = {'<': '>', '(': ')', '[': ']'}\n    closing = {'>': '<', ')': '(', ']': '['}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in opening:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in closing:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == closing[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Generate the closing sequence\n    closing_sequence = ''\n    while stack:\n        closing_sequence += opening[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return sequence + closing_sequence\n\nsequence = \"< ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) )\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the completed sequence. The sequence is correctly completed with the necessary closing bracket for the initial opening angle bracket `<`.\n\nThe final completed sequence is:\n\n<<< < ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) ) > >>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
