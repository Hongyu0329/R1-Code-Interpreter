    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses and brackets such that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The input sequence is \"( ( { }\". \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first symbol is '(', which is an opening parenthesis. It needs a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.\n2. The second symbol is another '(', which also needs a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.\n3. The third symbol is '{', which is an opening brace. It needs a corresponding closing brace '}'.\n4. The fourth symbol is '}', which is a closing brace. This matches the third symbol '{'.\n\nNow, we need to add the necessary closing symbols to balance the sequence:\n\n- The first '{' is already closed by the '}'.\n- The two '(' symbols need to be closed by two ')' symbols.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be \"( ( { } ) )\".\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to ensure the sequence is balanced.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\n# Initial sequence\ninitial_sequence = \"( ( { }\"\n\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = initial_sequence + \" ) )\"\n\n# Check if the completed sequence is balanced\nprint(is_balanced(completed_sequence))\n```\n\nThe code checks if the completed sequence \"( ( { } ) )\" is balanced. If the output is `True`, it confirms that the sequence is correctly balanced.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the completed sequence \"( ( { } ) )\" is indeed balanced. This confirms that the sequence has been correctly completed with the necessary closing symbols.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to complete the sequence is:\n\n<<<( ( { } ) )>>>"
