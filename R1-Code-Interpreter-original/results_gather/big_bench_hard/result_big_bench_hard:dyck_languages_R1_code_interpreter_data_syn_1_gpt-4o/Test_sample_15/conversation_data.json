    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly closed. The input sequence is `< { < > } { (`, and we need to determine the correct closing sequence.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket. It needs a closing `>`.\n2. `{` - This is an opening curly brace. It needs a closing `}`.\n3. `<` - Another opening angle bracket. It needs a closing `>`.\n4. `>` - This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the last opened `<`.\n5. `}` - This is a closing curly brace, which matches the last opened `{`.\n6. `{` - This is another opening curly brace. It needs a closing `}`.\n7. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis. It needs a closing `)`.\n\nNow, let's determine the correct closing sequence:\n\n- The last opened bracket is `(`, so it should be closed first with `)`.\n- Next, the opened `{` should be closed with `}`.\n\nThus, the complete sequence should be `< { < > } { ( ) }`.\n\nTo verify this, let's write a Python script to check the balance of the brackets and generate the correct closing sequence.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    closing_sequence = ''\n    \n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    while stack:\n        closing_sequence += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return input_sequence + closing_sequence\n\ninput_sequence = \"< { < > } { (\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the completed sequence `< { < > } { ()}>`. This sequence correctly closes all the opened brackets in the input sequence `< { < > } { (`.\n\nThe sequence is completed as follows:\n- The last opened bracket `(` is closed with `)`.\n- The opened `{` is closed with `}`.\n- The opened `<` is closed with `>`.\n\nThus, the final completed sequence is `< { < > } { ()}>`.\n\n<<< < { < > } { ()}> >>>"
