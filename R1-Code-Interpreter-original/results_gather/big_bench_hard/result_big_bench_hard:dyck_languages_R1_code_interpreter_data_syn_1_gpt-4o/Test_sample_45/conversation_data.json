    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all of them are properly closed. The input sequence is `< { ( ( )`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `{` - This is an opening curly brace.\n3. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis.\n4. `(` - This is another opening parenthesis.\n5. `)` - This is a closing parenthesis.\n\nTo properly close all the opened brackets and parentheses, we need to:\n\n- Close the last opened parenthesis `(` with a `)`.\n- Close the first opened parenthesis `(` with a `)`.\n- Close the curly brace `{` with a `}`.\n- Close the angle bracket `<` with a `>`.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows: `< { ( ( ) ) } >`.\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's write a Python script to automate this process. The script will use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and ensure they are closed in the correct order.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_pairs = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Result list to build the completed sequence\n    result = list(input_sequence)\n    \n    # Iterate over the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_pairs:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_pairs.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack\n            if stack and matching_pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Close all remaining open brackets\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        result.append(matching_pairs[open_bracket])\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< { ( ( )\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the completed sequence\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will output the completed sequence by ensuring all brackets are properly closed. Let's execute it to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the completed sequence `< { ( ( ))}>`. This sequence properly closes all the opened brackets and parentheses in the correct order.\n\nThe sequence starts with `< { ( ( )` and is completed by adding `) } >` to close the parentheses, curly brace, and angle bracket, respectively.\n\nThus, the final completed sequence is:\n\n<<< < { ( ( ))}> >>>"
