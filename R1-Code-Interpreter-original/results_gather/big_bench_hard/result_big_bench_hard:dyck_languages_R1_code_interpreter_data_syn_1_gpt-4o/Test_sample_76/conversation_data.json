    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses so that all of them are properly closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: round `()`, curly `{}`, and angle `<>`. \n\nThe input sequence is: `( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `(` - This is an open parenthesis that needs a closing `)`.\n2. `{ }` - This is a complete set of curly brackets.\n3. `< >` - This is a complete set of angle brackets.\n4. `{` - This is an open curly bracket that needs a closing `}`.\n5. `<` - This is an open angle bracket that needs a closing `>`.\n6. `{` - This is an open curly bracket that needs a closing `}`.\n7. `(` - This is an open parenthesis that needs a closing `)`.\n8. `< >` - This is a complete set of angle brackets.\n9. `)` - This closes the open parenthesis from step 7.\n10. `}` - This closes the open curly bracket from step 6.\n11. `>` - This closes the open angle bracket from step 5.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The open curly bracket from step 4 needs a closing `}`.\n- The open parenthesis from step 1 needs a closing `)`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and ensure all brackets are closed properly.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    pairs = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in pairs.keys():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in pairs.values():\n            if stack and pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += pairs[stack.pop()]\n\n    return completed_sequence\n\nsequence = \"( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis script will help us determine the correct sequence by closing all open brackets. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the completed sequence. Let's analyze the output:\n\nThe input sequence was: `( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >`\n\nThe completed sequence is: `( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >})`\n\nThis sequence correctly closes all the open brackets:\n\n1. The open parenthesis `(` at the beginning is closed by the `)` at the end.\n2. The open curly bracket `{` after `< >` is closed by the `}` before the final `)`.\n3. All other brackets are already properly closed within the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final completed sequence is correct.\n\n<<<( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >})>>>"
