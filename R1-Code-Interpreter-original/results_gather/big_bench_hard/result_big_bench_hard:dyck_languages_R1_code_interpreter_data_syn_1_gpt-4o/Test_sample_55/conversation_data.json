    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is \"( < < < >\", which includes a mix of parentheses and angle brackets. \n\nThe task is to complete the sequence so that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols, and the sequence is balanced. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Symbols**: \n   - Opening symbols: `(`, `<`\n   - Closing symbols: `)`, `>`\n\n2. **Count the Symbols**:\n   - Count the number of each type of opening and closing symbols in the input sequence.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Closing Symbols**:\n   - For each type of opening symbol, determine how many closing symbols are needed to balance the sequence.\n\n4. **Generate the Completed Sequence**:\n   - Append the necessary closing symbols to the input sequence to make it balanced.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Initialize counters for opening and closing symbols\n    open_paren = 0\n    open_angle = 0\n    close_paren = 0\n    close_angle = 0\n    \n    # Count the symbols in the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char == '(':\n            open_paren += 1\n        elif char == '<':\n            open_angle += 1\n        elif char == ')':\n            close_paren += 1\n        elif char == '>':\n            close_angle += 1\n    \n    # Determine the number of closing symbols needed\n    needed_close_paren = open_paren - close_paren\n    needed_close_angle = open_angle - close_angle\n    \n    # Generate the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = input_sequence + ')' * needed_close_paren + '>' * needed_close_angle\n    \n    return completed_sequence\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"( < < < >\"\n\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the completed sequence\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis script will count the opening and closing symbols, determine how many are needed to balance the sequence, and then generate the completed sequence. Let's execute the code to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output sequence \"( < < < >)>>\". \n\nLet's analyze the output:\n\n1. **Input Sequence**: \"( < < < >\"\n   - Opening symbols: 1 `(`, 3 `<`\n   - Closing symbols: 1 `>`\n\n2. **Balancing the Sequence**:\n   - We need 1 `)` to balance the `(`.\n   - We need 2 more `>` to balance the 3 `<` since there is already 1 `>` in the sequence.\n\n3. **Completed Sequence**: The output \"( < < < >)>>\" correctly balances the sequence by adding 1 `)` and 2 `>`.\n\nTherefore, the final balanced sequence is:\n\n<<<( < < < >)>>>>>"
