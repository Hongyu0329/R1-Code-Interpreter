    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets so that all types of brackets are properly closed. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ \\{ \\langle ( ) \\rangle \\}\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. **[**: This is the first bracket, which is an opening square bracket.\n2. **{**: This is the second bracket, which is an opening curly brace.\n3. **<**: This is the third bracket, which is an opening angle bracket.\n4. **(**: This is the fourth bracket, which is an opening parenthesis.\n5. **)**: This is the fifth bracket, which is a closing parenthesis. This matches with the fourth bracket.\n6. **>**: This is the sixth bracket, which is a closing angle bracket. This matches with the third bracket.\n7. **}**: This is the seventh bracket, which is a closing curly brace. This matches with the second bracket.\n\nThe sequence is missing the closing square bracket to match the first opening square bracket. Therefore, we need to add a closing square bracket at the end of the sequence.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify this logic and ensure that the sequence is balanced and complete.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[', '>': '<'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\n# Original sequence\nsequence = \"[{<()>}]\"  # Adding the missing closing bracket\n\n# Check if the sequence is balanced\nis_balanced_sequence = is_balanced(sequence)\nprint(is_balanced_sequence)\n```\n\nThe code will check if the sequence is balanced after adding the missing closing square bracket. If the sequence is balanced, it will return `True`.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence is balanced after adding the missing closing square bracket. This confirms that the sequence is complete and properly closed.\n\nThe original sequence was:\n\n\\[ \\{ \\langle ( ) \\rangle \\}\n\nBy adding the missing closing square bracket, the complete sequence becomes:\n\n\\[ \\{ \\langle ( ) \\rangle \\} \\]\n\nThis sequence is now balanced and properly closed.\n\n<<<[ { < ( ) > } ]>>>"
