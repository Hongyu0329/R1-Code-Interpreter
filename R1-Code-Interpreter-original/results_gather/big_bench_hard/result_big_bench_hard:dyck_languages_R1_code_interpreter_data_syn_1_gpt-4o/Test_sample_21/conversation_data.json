    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets such that all the parentheses are closed properly. The input sequence is `{ ( [ ] )`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{` - This is an opening curly brace.\n2. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis.\n3. `[` - This is an opening square bracket.\n4. `]` - This is a closing square bracket, which matches the last opened square bracket.\n5. `)` - This is a closing parenthesis, which matches the last opened parenthesis.\n\nNow, we have an opening curly brace `{` that hasn't been closed yet. To properly close all the brackets, we need to add a closing curly brace `}` at the end of the sequence.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `{ ( [ ] ) }`.\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to check if the sequence is balanced and properly closed.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\nsequence = \"{ ( [ ] ) }\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence `{ ( [ ] ) }` is balanced. If it is, the function will return `True`, indicating that the sequence is properly closed.\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm our solution.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence `{ ( [ ] ) }` is indeed balanced and properly closed. This confirms that our reasoning was correct.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses is:\n\n<<<{ ( [ ] ) }>>>"
