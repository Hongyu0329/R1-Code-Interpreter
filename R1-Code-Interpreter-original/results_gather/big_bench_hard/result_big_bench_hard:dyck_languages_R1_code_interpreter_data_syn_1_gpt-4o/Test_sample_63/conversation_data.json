    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly closed. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ < < { } > < > > ( ) \\]\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. **[**: This is the first bracket, and it needs a matching **]**.\n2. **<**: This is the second bracket, and it needs a matching **>**.\n3. **<**: This is the third bracket, and it needs a matching **>**.\n4. **{**: This is the fourth bracket, and it needs a matching **}**.\n5. **}**: This closes the fourth bracket.\n6. **>**: This closes the third bracket.\n7. **<**: This is the fifth bracket, and it needs a matching **>**.\n8. **>**: This closes the fifth bracket.\n9. **>**: This closes the second bracket.\n10. **(**: This is the sixth bracket, and it needs a matching **)**.\n11. **)**: This closes the sixth bracket.\n\nNow, we need to close the first bracket **[** with a **]**.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify the sequence and determine the missing closing bracket.\n\n```python\ndef check_brackets(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {']': '[', '>': '<', '}': '{', ')': '('}\n    opening_brackets = set(matching_bracket.values())\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in opening_brackets:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket:\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # If stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets\n    if stack:\n        return f\"Missing closing bracket for {stack[-1]}\"\n    return \"All brackets are properly closed\"\n\nsequence = ['[', '<', '<', '{', '}', '>', '<', '>', '>', '(', ')']\nresult = check_brackets(sequence)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will check if all brackets are properly closed and identify any missing closing brackets. Let's execute the code to find the missing bracket.\n\nOnce the code is executed, we can determine the final answer.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence is missing a closing bracket for the opening bracket **[**. Therefore, to complete the sequence properly, we need to add a closing bracket **]** at the end.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ < < { } > < > > ( ) ] \n\n<<<[ < < { } > < > > ( ) ]>>>"
