    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) >\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. \\[ - Open square bracket\n2. < - Open angle bracket\n3. ( - Open parenthesis\n4. < - Open angle bracket\n5. < - Open angle bracket\n6. > - Close angle bracket (matches the last opened angle bracket)\n7. [ - Open square bracket\n8. ] - Close square bracket (matches the last opened square bracket)\n9. ( - Open parenthesis\n10. ) - Close parenthesis (matches the last opened parenthesis)\n11. > - Close angle bracket (matches the last opened angle bracket)\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first open square bracket \\[ needs a closing bracket \\].\n- The first open angle bracket < needs a closing bracket >.\n- The first open parenthesis ( needs a closing bracket ).\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n\\[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > ) > ]\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's write a Python script to verify and complete the sequence.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(seq):\n    stack = []\n    pairs = {'[': ']', '<': '>', '(': ')'}\n    for char in seq:\n        if char in pairs:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in pairs.values():\n            if stack and pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Complete the sequence\n    completion = ''.join(pairs[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    return seq + completion\n\ninput_sequence = \"[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) >\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will check the sequence and complete it by adding the necessary closing brackets. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the completed sequence. Let's analyze the output:\n\nThe input sequence was: `[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) >`\n\nThe completed sequence is: `[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) >)>]`\n\nThis means the sequence was completed by adding `)>]` at the end, which correctly closes all the open brackets and parentheses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) >)>]>>>"
