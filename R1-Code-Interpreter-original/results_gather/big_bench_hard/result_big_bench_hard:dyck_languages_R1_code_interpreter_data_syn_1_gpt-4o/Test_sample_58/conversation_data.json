    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. The sequence provided is:\n\n`< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] )`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis.\n3. `[ [ [ [ ` - These are four opening square brackets.\n4. `( )` - This is a pair of parentheses that is already closed.\n5. `] ]` - These are two closing square brackets.\n6. `{ }` - This is a pair of braces that is already closed.\n7. `] ]` - These are two more closing square brackets.\n8. `)` - This is a closing parenthesis.\n\nNow, let's match the opening and closing symbols:\n\n- The angle bracket `<` is not closed.\n- The parenthesis `(` is closed by `)`.\n- The four opening square brackets `[ [ [ [` are closed by `] ] ] ]`.\n- The braces `{ }` are already closed.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to add a closing angle bracket `>` at the end to match the opening `<`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify and complete the sequence:\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    pairs = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in pairs:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in pairs.values():\n            if stack and pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Invalid sequence\"\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing characters\n    while stack:\n        sequence += pairs[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return sequence\n\ninput_sequence = \"< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] )\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis script will check the sequence and add any necessary closing characters to ensure all symbols are properly closed. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the completed sequence. The sequence is now properly closed with the addition of a closing angle bracket `>` at the end. \n\nThe final completed sequence is:\n\n<<< < ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] ) > >>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly.
