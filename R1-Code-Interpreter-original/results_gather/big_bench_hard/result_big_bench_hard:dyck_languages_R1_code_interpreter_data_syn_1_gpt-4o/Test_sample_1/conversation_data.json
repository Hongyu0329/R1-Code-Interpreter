    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all are properly closed. The input sequence is `< [ [`. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets**: The sequence starts with `<`, followed by two `[`. This means we have one angle bracket and two square brackets that need to be closed.\n\n2. **Determine the closing order**: \n   - The last opened bracket should be closed first. This is similar to a stack data structure where the last element added is the first one to be removed.\n   - Therefore, the first bracket to close is the last opened `[`, followed by the second `[`, and finally the `<`.\n\n3. **Construct the closing sequence**:\n   - The first closing bracket should be `]` to close the last `[`.\n   - The second closing bracket should be `]` to close the first `[`.\n   - The final closing bracket should be `>` to close the `<`.\n\n4. **Combine the sequences**: \n   - The complete sequence should be `< [ [ ] ] >`.\n\nLet's verify this logic using a simple Python script to ensure the sequence is balanced and correctly closed.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\nsequence = \"<[[]]>\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code checks if the sequence `<[[]]>` is balanced. If the output is `True`, it confirms our sequence is correct.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the sequence.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence `<[[]]>` is indeed balanced and correctly closed. This confirms that our reasoning and construction of the sequence were accurate.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses and brackets is:\n\n<<<answer <[[]]>>>"
