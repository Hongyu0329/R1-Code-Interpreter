    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The sequence given is:\n\n```\n{ } < { } < > (\n```\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{ }` - This is a complete set of curly braces.\n2. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n3. `{ }` - This is another complete set of curly braces.\n4. `<` - This is another opening angle bracket.\n5. `>` - This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the previous `<`.\n6. `(` - This is an opening parenthesis.\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Currently, we have:\n\n- One opening angle bracket `<` that needs a closing `>`.\n- One opening parenthesis `(` that needs a closing `)`.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n```\n{ } < { } < > ( ) >\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that all brackets are properly closed. Let's verify this by writing a small Python script to check the balance of the brackets.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '{<(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in '})>':\n            if not stack or stack[-1] != matching_bracket[char]:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    \n    return not stack\n\nsequence = \"{ } < { } < > ( ) >\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify if the sequence is balanced.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence is balanced, which means all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Therefore, the completed sequence is correct.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n```\n{ } < { } < > ( ) >\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that all brackets are properly closed and balanced.\n\n<<<{ } < { } < > ( ) >>>"
