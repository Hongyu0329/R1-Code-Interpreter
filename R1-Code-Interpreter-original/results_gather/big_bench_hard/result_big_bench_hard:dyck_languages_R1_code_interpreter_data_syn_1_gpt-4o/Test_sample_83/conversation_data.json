    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets such that all the opened brackets are properly closed in the correct order. The sequence given is `{ < [ ]`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `{` is an opening curly brace, so it needs a closing curly brace `}`.\n2. `<` is an opening angle bracket, so it needs a closing angle bracket `>`.\n3. `[` is an opening square bracket, and it is already closed by the `]` in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is currently: `{ < [ ]`\n\n- The square bracket `[` is already closed by `]`.\n- The angle bracket `<` needs to be closed by `>`.\n- The curly brace `{` needs to be closed by `}`.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be completed as: `{ < [ ] > }`.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to automate the process of checking and completing the sequence.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Dictionary to map opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets\n    bracket_map = {'{': '}', '<': '>', '[': ']', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in bracket_map:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in bracket_map.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack\n            if stack and bracket_map[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Now, complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += bracket_map[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return completed_sequence\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ < [ ]\"\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThe code will complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the completed sequence `{ < [ ]>}`. This matches our manual reasoning, where we determined that the sequence should be completed by adding a closing angle bracket `>` and a closing curly brace `}`.\n\nTherefore, the final completed sequence is `{ < [ ]>}`.\n\n<<<{ < [ ]>}>>>"
