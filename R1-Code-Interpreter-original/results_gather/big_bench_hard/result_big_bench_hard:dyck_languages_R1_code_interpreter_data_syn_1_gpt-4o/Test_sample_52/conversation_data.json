    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all of them are properly closed. The input sequence is `< < ( < >`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<`: This is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n2. `<`: Another opening angle bracket. It also needs a closing angle bracket `>`.\n3. `(`: This is an opening parenthesis. It needs a closing parenthesis `)`.\n4. `<`: Another opening angle bracket. It needs a closing angle bracket `>`.\n5. `>`: This is a closing angle bracket. It closes the most recent unmatched opening angle bracket.\n\nNow, let's determine what is unmatched:\n\n- We have two unmatched opening angle brackets `<`.\n- We have one unmatched opening parenthesis `(`.\n\nTo properly close all the brackets and parentheses, we need to add:\n\n- One closing parenthesis `)` to match the opening parenthesis `(`.\n- Two closing angle brackets `>` to match the two opening angle brackets `<`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `< < ( < > ) > >`.\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to ensure the sequence is balanced and properly closed.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in \"<(\":\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == '>':\n            if stack and stack[-1] == '<':\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Unbalanced\"\n        elif char == ')':\n            if stack and stack[-1] == '(':\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return \"Unbalanced\"\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets\n    result = sequence\n    while stack:\n        top = stack.pop()\n        if top == '<':\n            result += '>'\n        elif top == '(':\n            result += ')'\n    \n    return result\n\nsequence = \"< < ( < >\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the completed sequence `< < ( < >)>>`. This matches our reasoning, where we determined that the sequence should be completed with one closing parenthesis `)` and two closing angle brackets `>`. \n\nThe sequence is now properly balanced and all brackets and parentheses are closed correctly.\n\n<<< < < ( < > ) > > >>>"
