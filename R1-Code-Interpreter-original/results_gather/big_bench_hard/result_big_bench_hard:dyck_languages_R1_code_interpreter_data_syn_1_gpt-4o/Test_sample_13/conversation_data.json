    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, and `}`. The task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets.\n\nThe approach involves using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. As we iterate through the sequence, we push each opening bracket onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, we pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is not balanced, but since we are asked to complete it, we will assume the input is correct up to the point given and focus on completing it.\n\nLet's write a Python script to process the input sequence and determine the necessary closing brackets to complete it.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(input_sequence):\n    # Define matching pairs\n    matching_bracket = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    \n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for char in input_sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket\n            else:\n                # This would be an error in a real scenario, but we assume input is correct\n                pass\n    \n    # Now, stack contains unmatched opening brackets\n    # We need to add the corresponding closing brackets\n    completion = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    return completion\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< ( ( [ < > { [ { ( ) } ] < { < { } > [ ( < > ) ] } > } [ < > ] ] ) { { ( { ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] < { } > ) ) { { ( [ [ ] ] ) } [ ( ) ] { { [ ] } } } } ) } ( { } )\"\n\n# Get the completion sequence\ncompletion_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the final completed sequence\nprint(input_sequence + completion_sequence)\n```\n\nThis script will process the input sequence and determine the necessary closing brackets to complete it. Let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
