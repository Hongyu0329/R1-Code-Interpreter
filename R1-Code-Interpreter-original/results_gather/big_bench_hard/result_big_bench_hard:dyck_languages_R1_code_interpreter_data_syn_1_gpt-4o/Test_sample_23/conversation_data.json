    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets, ensuring that all the parentheses are closed properly. The sequence given is:\n\n`< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ]`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<`: This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `{`: This is an opening curly brace.\n3. `<`: This is another opening angle bracket.\n4. `[`: This is an opening square bracket.\n5. `[`: This is another opening square bracket.\n6. `(`: This is an opening parenthesis.\n7. `{`: This is an opening curly brace.\n8. `}`: This is a closing curly brace, which matches the last opened curly brace.\n9. `)`: This is a closing parenthesis, which matches the last opened parenthesis.\n10. `]`: This is a closing square bracket, which matches the last opened square bracket.\n11. `]`: This is another closing square bracket, which matches the second last opened square bracket.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining opened brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- The last opened bracket is `<`, so we need to close it with `>`.\n- The next opened bracket is `{`, so we need to close it with `}`.\n- The first opened bracket is `<`, so we need to close it with `>`.\n\nThus, the complete sequence should be:\n\n`< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] > } >`\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to ensure the sequence is balanced and correctly closed.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {'>': '<', '}': '{', ']': '[', ')': '('}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '<{[(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in '>})]':\n            if not stack or stack[-1] != matching_bracket[char]:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    \n    return not stack\n\nsequence = \"<{<[[({})]]>}>\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence is balanced and correctly closed. If the output is `True`, it means the sequence is correct.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the sequence.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence `<{<[[({})]]>}>` is balanced and all the parentheses are closed properly. \n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<< <{<[[({})]]>}> >>>"
