    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly closed. The sequence given is:\n\nInput: ( { } ) < { < { } >\n\nWe need to determine the correct closing sequence for the brackets. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first bracket is `(`, which is closed by `)`.\n2. The second bracket is `{`, which is closed by `}`.\n3. The third bracket is `}`, which is already closed.\n4. The fourth bracket is `)`, which is already closed.\n5. The fifth bracket is `<`, which needs to be closed by `>`.\n6. The sixth bracket is `{`, which needs to be closed by `}`.\n7. The seventh bracket is `<`, which needs to be closed by `>`.\n8. The eighth bracket is `{`, which is closed by `}`.\n9. The ninth bracket is `}`, which is already closed.\n\nNow, let's determine the missing closing brackets:\n\n- The fifth bracket `<` needs a closing `>`.\n- The sixth bracket `{` needs a closing `}`.\n- The seventh bracket `<` needs a closing `>`.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n( { } ) < { < { } > } >\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to ensure the sequence is balanced and correctly closed.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '({<':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in ')}>':\n            if not stack or stack[-1] != matching_bracket[char]:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    \n    return not stack\n\n# Original sequence with added closing brackets\nsequence = \"( { } ) < { < { } > } >\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify if the sequence is balanced.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence is balanced and correctly closed. The sequence `( { } ) < { < { } > } >` is valid, meaning all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<<( { } ) < { < { } > } >>>"
