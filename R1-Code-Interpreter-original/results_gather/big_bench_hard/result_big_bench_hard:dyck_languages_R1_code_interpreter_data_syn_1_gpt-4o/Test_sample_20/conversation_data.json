    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets such that all the parentheses are closed properly. The sequence given is:\n\nInput: { ( < [ < > ]\n\nWe need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The sequence contains the following opening brackets: `{`, `(`, `<`, `[`, `<`. The closing brackets present are: `>`, `]`.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. `{` is opened first, so it should be closed last.\n2. `(` is opened second, so it should be closed second last.\n3. `<` is opened third, so it should be closed third last.\n4. `[` is opened fourth, so it should be closed fourth last.\n5. `<` is opened fifth, and it is closed immediately with `>`, so this pair is already complete.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- `[` should be closed with `]`.\n- `<` should be closed with `>`.\n- `(` should be closed with `)`.\n- `{` should be closed with `}`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and generate the correct sequence.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Dictionary to match opening and closing brackets\n    matching_bracket = {'{': '}', '(': ')', '<': '>', '[': ']'}\n    \n    # Iterate over the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Now, stack contains unclosed opening brackets\n    # We need to close them in reverse order\n    result = sequence\n    while stack:\n        result += matching_bracket[stack.pop()]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"{ ( < [ < > ]\"\n# Complete the sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the completed sequence. Let's analyze the output:\n\nThe input sequence was: `{ ( < [ < > ]`\n\nThe completed sequence is: `{ ( < [ < > ]>)}`\n- The `<` opened after `[` is closed with `>`.\n- The `[` is closed with `]`.\n- The `<` opened after `(` is closed with `>`.\n- The `(` is closed with `)`.\n- The `{` is closed with `}`.\n\nThe sequence is now properly balanced with all opening brackets having corresponding closing brackets.\n\n<<<{ ( < [ < > ]>)}>>>"
