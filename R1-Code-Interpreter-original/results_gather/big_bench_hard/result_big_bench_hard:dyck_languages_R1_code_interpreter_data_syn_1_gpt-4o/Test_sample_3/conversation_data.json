    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. The sequence provided is:\n\n`< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { }`\n\nThe sequence consists of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. The task is to complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order.\n\n### Steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the unmatched opening brackets**: We need to find out which opening brackets do not have corresponding closing brackets.\n\n2. **Determine the order of closing**: The closing brackets must be added in the reverse order of their opening to ensure proper nesting.\n\n3. **Generate the final sequence**: Append the necessary closing brackets to the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n- `<` is opened.\n- `[` is opened and closed.\n- `{` is opened.\n- `<` is opened.\n- `(` is opened and closed.\n- `>` is closed.\n- `}` is closed.\n- `[` is opened and closed.\n- `(` is opened.\n- `{` is opened and closed.\n\nNow, we have the following unmatched opening brackets: `<` and `(`.\n\nThe correct order to close them is to first close `(` and then close `<`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and generate the final sequence.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Dictionary to match opening and closing brackets\n    matching_bracket = {'<': '>', '[': ']', '{': '}', '(': ')'}\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.values():\n            # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack\n            if stack and matching_bracket[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Generate the closing sequence\n    closing_sequence = ''.join(matching_bracket[char] for char in reversed(stack))\n    \n    # Return the completed sequence\n    return sequence + closing_sequence\n\n# Given input sequence\ninput_sequence = \"< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { }\"\n# Remove spaces for processing\ninput_sequence = input_sequence.replace(\" \", \"\")\n# Get the completed sequence\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the completed sequence.",
