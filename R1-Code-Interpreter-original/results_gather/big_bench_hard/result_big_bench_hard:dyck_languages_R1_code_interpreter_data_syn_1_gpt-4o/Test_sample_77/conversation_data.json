    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all opening brackets and parentheses have corresponding closing ones, and they are properly nested.\n\nThe given sequence is: `< < [ ] > ( < > ) <`\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `<` - Open angle bracket\n2. `<` - Open angle bracket\n3. `[` - Open square bracket\n4. `]` - Close square bracket (matches the third character)\n5. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the second character)\n6. `(` - Open parenthesis\n7. `<` - Open angle bracket\n8. `>` - Close angle bracket (matches the seventh character)\n9. `)` - Close parenthesis (matches the sixth character)\n10. `<` - Open angle bracket\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets:\n\n- The first `<` is still open.\n- The last `<` is still open.\n\nTo close these, we need two `>` characters.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be: `< < [ ] > ( < > ) < > >`\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to ensure all brackets are properly closed and nested.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '>': '<', ']': '['}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\nsequence = \"< < [ ] > ( < > ) < > >\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence is balanced. If it returns `True`, our sequence is correct.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the sequence.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence `< < [ ] > ( < > ) < > >` is indeed balanced and properly nested. This confirms that the sequence is correctly completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < < [ ] > ( < > ) < > > >>>"
