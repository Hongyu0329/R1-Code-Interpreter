    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all are properly closed. The input sequence is `< [ < > ]`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n2. `[` - This is an opening square bracket. It needs a corresponding closing square bracket `]`.\n3. `<` - This is another opening angle bracket. It is closed by the `>` that follows it.\n4. `>` - This closes the most recent opening angle bracket `<`.\n5. `]` - This closes the most recent opening square bracket `[`.\n\nNow, we need to close the first opening angle bracket `<` that hasn't been closed yet. Therefore, we need to add a `>` at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe completed sequence should be `< [ < > ] >`.\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to ensure that the sequence is balanced and properly closed.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {'>': '<', ']': '['}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in '<[':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in '>]':\n            if not stack or stack[-1] != matching_bracket[char]:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    \n    return not stack\n\nsequence = \"< [ < > ] >\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence is balanced and properly closed. If the output is `True`, it means the sequence is correct.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the sequence.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence `< [ < > ] >` is balanced and properly closed. This confirms that the sequence is correctly completed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < [ < > ] > >>>"
