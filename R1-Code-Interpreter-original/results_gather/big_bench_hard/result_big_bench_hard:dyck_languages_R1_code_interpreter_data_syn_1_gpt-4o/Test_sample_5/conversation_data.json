    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n```\n( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > }\n```\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. We start with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n2. Then we have an opening square bracket `[`.\n3. Another opening square bracket `[`.\n4. Another opening square bracket `[`.\n5. An opening curly brace `{`.\n6. A closing curly brace `}`.\n7. A closing square bracket `]`.\n8. A closing square bracket `]`.\n9. An opening curly brace `{`.\n10. An opening angle bracket `<`.\n11. An opening square bracket `[`.\n12. An opening angle bracket `<`.\n13. An opening square bracket `[`.\n14. An opening curly brace `{`.\n15. A closing curly brace `}`.\n16. A closing square bracket `]`.\n17. A closing angle bracket `>`.\n18. A closing square bracket `]`.\n19. A closing angle bracket `>`.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening:\n\n- The last opened bracket is `{`, so we need a `}`.\n- The next is `[`, so we need a `]`.\n- The next is `(`, so we need a `)`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and ensure that all brackets are closed properly.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    # Dictionary to match opening and closing brackets\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    # List to store the completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = list(sequence)\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the sequence\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in \"([{<\":\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push to stack\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in \")]}>\":\n            # If it's a closing bracket, pop from stack\n            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[char]:\n                stack.pop()\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets in reverse order\n    while stack:\n        open_bracket = stack.pop()\n        for close_bracket, open_bracket_match in matching_bracket.items():\n            if open_bracket_match == open_bracket:\n                completed_sequence.append(close_bracket)\n                break\n    \n    return ''.join(completed_sequence)\n\nsequence = \"( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > }\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the completed sequence. The sequence is now properly closed with all brackets matched correctly.\n\nThe final completed sequence is:\n\n<<<( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > }])>>>"
