    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of parentheses and angle brackets such that all opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The input sequence is `( ( < >`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. The first symbol is `(`, which is an opening parenthesis. It needs a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.\n2. The second symbol is another `(`, which also needs a closing parenthesis `)`.\n3. The third symbol is `<`, which is an opening angle bracket. It needs a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n4. The fourth symbol is `>`, which is a closing angle bracket. This matches the third symbol `<`.\n\nNow, let's determine what is needed to complete the sequence:\n\n- The first `(` needs a `)`.\n- The second `(` also needs a `)`.\n\nThe sequence is currently: `( ( < >`. To complete it, we need to add two closing parentheses `)` at the end.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be: `( ( < > ) )`.\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to ensure the sequence is balanced and correctly closed.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(seq):\n    stack = []\n    for char in seq:\n        if char in \"(<\":\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in \")>\":\n            if not stack:\n                return \"Unbalanced\"\n            top = stack.pop()\n            if (char == ')' and top != '(') or (char == '>' and top != '<'):\n                return \"Unbalanced\"\n    \n    # Add remaining closing brackets\n    while stack:\n        top = stack.pop()\n        if top == '(':\n            seq += ')'\n        elif top == '<':\n            seq += '>'\n    \n    return seq\n\ninput_sequence = \"( ( < >\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(input_sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the completed sequence `( ( < >))`. This matches our manual reasoning, where we determined that the sequence needed two additional closing parentheses to be properly balanced.\n\nTherefore, the final completed sequence is:\n\n<<<( ( < > ))>>>"
