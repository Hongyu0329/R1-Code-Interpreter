    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses such that all are properly closed. The sequence given is:\n\n`< < { ( < ( ) > )`\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `<` - Another opening angle bracket.\n3. `{` - An opening curly brace.\n4. `(` - An opening parenthesis.\n5. `<` - An opening angle bracket.\n6. `(` - An opening parenthesis.\n7. `)` - A closing parenthesis. This closes the last opened parenthesis.\n8. `>` - A closing angle bracket. This closes the last opened angle bracket.\n9. `)` - A closing parenthesis. This closes the parenthesis opened at step 4.\n\nNow, we need to close the remaining opened brackets:\n\n- The curly brace `{` opened at step 3 needs to be closed.\n- The two angle brackets `<` opened at steps 1 and 2 need to be closed.\n\nThe sequence should be completed as follows:\n\n- Close the curly brace with `}`.\n- Close the two angle brackets with `>>`.\n\nThus, the completed sequence is:\n\n`< < { ( < ( ) > ) } > >`\n\nLet's verify this with a simple Python script to ensure all brackets are properly closed.\n\n```python\ndef complete_sequence(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    pairs = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '<': '>'}\n    completed_sequence = sequence\n\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in pairs:\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in pairs.values():\n            if stack and pairs[stack[-1]] == char:\n                stack.pop()\n\n    while stack:\n        completed_sequence += pairs[stack.pop()]\n\n    return completed_sequence\n\nsequence = \"< < { ( < ( ) > )\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_sequence(sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nThis code will help us verify if the sequence is completed correctly. Let's execute it.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence was completed as `< < { ( < ( ) > )}>>`, which matches our manual reasoning. The sequence is now properly closed with all brackets and parentheses matched correctly.\n\nThe errors section is empty, indicating that there were no errors during the execution of the code.\n\nTherefore, the final completed sequence is:\n\n<<< < < { ( < ( ) > )}>> >>>"
