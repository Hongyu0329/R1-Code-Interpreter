    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. The sequence given is `< < { } >`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. `<` - This is an opening angle bracket.\n2. `<` - Another opening angle bracket.\n3. `{` - An opening curly brace.\n4. `}` - A closing curly brace.\n5. `>` - A closing angle bracket.\n\nThe sequence starts with two opening angle brackets, followed by an opening and closing curly brace, and ends with a closing angle bracket. \n\nTo ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to match each opening bracket with a corresponding closing bracket. The sequence currently has:\n\n- Two opening angle brackets `< <`\n- One closing angle bracket `>`\n- One pair of curly braces `{ }`\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to add one more closing angle bracket `>` to match the two opening angle brackets.\n\nThus, the completed sequence should be `< < { } > >`.\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to check the balance of the sequence.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', '>': '<'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\nsequence = \"< < { } > >\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. If the sequence is balanced, it will return `True`.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify our solution.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence `< < { } > >` is indeed balanced, confirming that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses is:\n\n<<< < < { } > > >>>"
