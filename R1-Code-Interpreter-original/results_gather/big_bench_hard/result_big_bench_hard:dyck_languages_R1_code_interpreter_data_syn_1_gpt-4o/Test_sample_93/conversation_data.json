    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly closed. The sequence consists of angle brackets `< >` and square brackets `[ ]`. The goal is to complete the sequence such that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order.\n\nLet's break down the given sequence:\n\n1. `[ < > [ [ < [ ] > ]`\n   - The sequence starts with `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Inside the first `[`, we have `< >`, which is already balanced.\n   - After `< >`, we have another `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Inside this `[`, we have another `[`, which also needs a closing `]`.\n   - Inside this second `[`, we have `< [ ] >`, where:\n     - `<` needs a closing `>`.\n     - `[ ]` is already balanced.\n     - `>` is already present, closing the `<`.\n\nNow, let's determine the missing closing brackets:\n\n- The first `[` needs a closing `]`.\n- The second `[` needs a closing `]`.\n\nThus, the sequence should be completed by adding two closing square brackets `]]` at the end.\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to check the balance of the brackets and suggest the necessary closing brackets.\n\n```python\ndef complete_brackets(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in \"[<\":\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in \"]>\":\n            if not stack:\n                return \"Unbalanced\"\n            top = stack.pop()\n            if (char == ']' and top != '[') or (char == '>' and top != '<'):\n                return \"Unbalanced\"\n    \n    # Add the necessary closing brackets\n    closing_sequence = \"\"\n    while stack:\n        top = stack.pop()\n        if top == '[':\n            closing_sequence += ']'\n        elif top == '<':\n            closing_sequence += '>'\n    \n    return sequence + closing_sequence\n\nsequence = \"[ < > [ [ < [ ] > ]\"\ncompleted_sequence = complete_brackets(sequence)\nprint(completed_sequence)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the completed sequence.",
