    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sequence of parentheses and brackets is balanced and properly closed. The input sequence is \"( [ ( )\", which means we have:\n\n1. An opening parenthesis '('\n2. An opening square bracket '['\n3. Another opening parenthesis '('\n4. A closing parenthesis ')'\n\nTo balance this sequence, we need to close the remaining open brackets and parentheses in the correct order. The correct order to close them is:\n\n1. Close the innermost open parenthesis with ')'\n2. Close the square bracket with ']'\n3. Finally, close the outermost parenthesis with ')'\n\nThus, the complete sequence should be \"( [ ( ) ] )\".\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to check if the sequence is balanced and properly closed.\n\n```python\ndef is_balanced(sequence):\n    stack = []\n    matching_bracket = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}\n    \n    for char in sequence:\n        if char in matching_bracket.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in matching_bracket.keys():\n            if stack == [] or matching_bracket[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n    return stack == []\n\n# Complete the sequence\nsequence = \"( [ ( ) ] )\"\nprint(is_balanced(sequence))\n```\n\nThis code will check if the sequence \"( [ ( ) ] )\" is balanced. If it is, the function will return `True`, indicating that the sequence is correctly closed.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify our solution.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that the sequence \"( [ ( ) ] )\" is indeed balanced and properly closed. This confirms that our reasoning and completion of the sequence were correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( [ ( ) ] )>>>"
