    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 56.00,84.00 L 63.00,84.00 L 63.00,51.00 L 56.00,51.00 L 56.00,84.00`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path at coordinates (56.00, 84.00).\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line to the specified coordinates.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - Start at (56.00, 84.00).\n   - Draw a line to (63.00, 84.00).\n   - Draw a line to (63.00, 51.00).\n   - Draw a line to (56.00, 51.00).\n   - Draw a line back to the starting point (56.00, 84.00).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Shape:**\n   - The path consists of four lines that form a closed shape.\n   - The lines are parallel and perpendicular to each other, indicating right angles.\n   - The coordinates suggest that the shape has two vertical sides (from 84.00 to 51.00) and two horizontal sides (from 56.00 to 63.00).\n   - The vertical sides are equal in length (84.00 - 51.00 = 33.00).\n   - The horizontal sides are equal in length (63.00 - 56.00 = 7.00).\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - The shape has four sides with opposite sides equal in length and all angles are right angles.\n   - This description matches that of a rectangle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The SVG path element draws a rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<rectangle>>>"
