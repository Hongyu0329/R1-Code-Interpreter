    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is a series of commands and coordinates. The commands are:\n     - `M` for \"move to\" (starting point)\n     - `L` for \"line to\" (draw a line to the specified point)\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - `M 22.37,37.09`: Move to the starting point (22.37, 37.09).\n   - `L 19.67,23.62`: Draw a line to (19.67, 23.62).\n   - `L 28.47,31.97`: Draw a line to (28.47, 31.97).\n   - `L 28.41,25.18`: Draw a line to (28.41, 25.18).\n   - `M 28.41,25.18`: Move to (28.41, 25.18) again (this is a redundant move as it is already at this point).\n   - `L 36.86,18.98`: Draw a line to (36.86, 18.98).\n   - `L 37.15,26.75`: Draw a line to (37.15, 26.75).\n   - `L 35.72,33.89`: Draw a line to (35.72, 33.89).\n   - `L 27.91,38.38`: Draw a line to (27.91, 38.38).\n   - `L 22.37,37.09`: Draw a line back to the starting point (22.37, 37.09), closing the shape.\n\n3. **Counting the Vertices:**\n   - The path consists of a series of line segments that connect a sequence of points.\n   - The points are: (22.37, 37.09), (19.67, 23.62), (28.47, 31.97), (28.41, 25.18), (36.86, 18.98), (37.15, 26.75), (35.72, 33.89), (27.91, 38.38), and back to (22.37, 37.09).\n   - There are 8 distinct points, indicating 8 sides.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A shape with 8 sides is an octagon.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the SVG path element draws an octagon.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<octagon>>>."
