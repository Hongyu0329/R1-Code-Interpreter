    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 82.48,71.72 L 86.86,76.47 L 74.69,38.07 M 74.69,38.07 L 46.36,43.46 L 40.46,60.21 L 76.97,78.68 L 82.48,71.72`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path.\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - The path starts at point (82.48, 71.72).\n   - Draws a line to (86.86, 76.47).\n   - Draws a line to (74.69, 38.07).\n   - Moves to (74.69, 38.07) again (this is a repeat, so it doesn't change the path).\n   - Draws a line to (46.36, 43.46).\n   - Draws a line to (40.46, 60.21).\n   - Draws a line to (76.97, 78.68).\n   - Finally, draws a line back to the starting point (82.48, 71.72).\n\n3. **Counting the Vertices:**\n   - The path consists of the following unique points: (82.48, 71.72), (86.86, 76.47), (74.69, 38.07), (46.36, 43.46), (40.46, 60.21), (76.97, 78.68).\n   - There are 6 unique points, which means the shape has 6 vertices.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A shape with 6 vertices is a hexagon.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the SVG path element draws a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
