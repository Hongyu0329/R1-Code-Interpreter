    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 76.00,30.00 L 58.00,25.00 L 42.00,26.00 L 41.00,41.00 L 47.00,54.00 L 76.00,30.00`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path at (76.00, 30.00).\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line to the specified coordinates.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - Start at (76.00, 30.00).\n   - Draw a line to (58.00, 25.00).\n   - Draw a line to (42.00, 26.00).\n   - Draw a line to (41.00, 41.00).\n   - Draw a line to (47.00, 54.00).\n   - Draw a line back to the starting point (76.00, 30.00).\n\n3. **Counting the Vertices:**\n   - The path consists of 5 distinct points: (76.00, 30.00), (58.00, 25.00), (42.00, 26.00), (41.00, 41.00), and (47.00, 54.00).\n   - The path returns to the starting point, forming a closed shape.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A closed shape with 5 vertices is a pentagon.\n\n5. **Cross-Referencing with Options:**\n   - The options provided are: circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle.\n   - The shape with 5 sides is a pentagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a pentagon.\n\nFinal answer: <<<G) pentagon>>>."
