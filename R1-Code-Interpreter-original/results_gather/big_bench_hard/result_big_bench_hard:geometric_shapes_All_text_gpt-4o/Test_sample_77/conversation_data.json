    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 55.58,17.52 L 53.95,26.14 L 47.22,29.95 M 47.22,29.95 L 48.21,22.28 L 55.58,17.52`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path.\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - `M 55.58,17.52`: Move to the starting point (55.58, 17.52).\n   - `L 53.95,26.14`: Draw a line to (53.95, 26.14).\n   - `L 47.22,29.95`: Draw a line to (47.22, 29.95).\n   - `M 47.22,29.95`: Move to (47.22, 29.95) again (this is the current point already).\n   - `L 48.21,22.28`: Draw a line to (48.21, 22.28).\n   - `L 55.58,17.52`: Draw a line back to the starting point (55.58, 17.52).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Shape:**\n   - The path consists of two segments:\n     - The first segment is a line from (55.58, 17.52) to (53.95, 26.14) to (47.22, 29.95).\n     - The second segment is a line from (47.22, 29.95) to (48.21, 22.28) to (55.58, 17.52).\n   - The path forms a closed shape with three vertices: (55.58, 17.52), (47.22, 29.95), and (48.21, 22.28).\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A closed shape with three vertices is a triangle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The SVG path element draws a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<J) triangle>>>"
