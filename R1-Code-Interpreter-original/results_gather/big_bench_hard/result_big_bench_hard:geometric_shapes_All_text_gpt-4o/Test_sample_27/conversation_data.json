    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 49.56,30.61 L 43.41,40.44 L 37.02,36.44 L 43.17,26.61 L 36.78,22.62 L 53.07,18.45 L 55.94,34.61 L 49.56,30.61`.\n   - `M` indicates the starting point of the path: (49.56, 30.61).\n   - `L` indicates a line to a new point.\n\n2. **Listing the Points:**\n   - Start at (49.56, 30.61)\n   - Line to (43.41, 40.44)\n   - Line to (37.02, 36.44)\n   - Line to (43.17, 26.61)\n   - Line to (36.78, 22.62)\n   - Line to (53.07, 18.45)\n   - Line to (55.94, 34.61)\n   - Line back to the starting point (49.56, 30.61)\n\n3. **Counting the Points:**\n   - There are 8 points in total, including the starting and ending point which are the same, indicating a closed shape.\n\n4. **Determining the Shape:**\n   - Since the path returns to the starting point and has 8 distinct vertices, it forms a closed shape with 8 sides.\n\n5. **Matching with Options:**\n   - A shape with 8 sides is an octagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws an octagon.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<octagon>>>."
