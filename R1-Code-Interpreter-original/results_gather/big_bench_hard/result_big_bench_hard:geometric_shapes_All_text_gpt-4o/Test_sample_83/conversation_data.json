    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 73.73,87.22 L 79.29,59.06 L 53.87,38.89 L 73.73,87.22`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path at coordinates (73.73, 87.22).\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - Start at (73.73, 87.22).\n   - Draw a line to (79.29, 59.06).\n   - Draw a line to (53.87, 38.89).\n   - Draw a line back to the starting point (73.73, 87.22).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Shape:**\n   - The path consists of three line segments that connect back to the starting point, forming a closed shape.\n   - The shape is defined by three vertices: (73.73, 87.22), (79.29, 59.06), and (53.87, 38.89).\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A closed shape with three vertices and three sides is a triangle.\n\n5. **Matching with Options:**\n   - Among the given options, the shape that matches a closed figure with three sides is a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<J) triangle>>>."
