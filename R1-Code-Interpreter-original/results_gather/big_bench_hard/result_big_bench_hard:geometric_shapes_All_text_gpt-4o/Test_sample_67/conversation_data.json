    "To determine the shape drawn by the given SVG path element, we need to analyze the path data step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 51.00,18.00 L 5.00,62.00 L 37.00,63.00 L 53.00,71.00 L 52.00,55.00 L 65.00,31.00 L 51.00,18.00`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path at (51.00, 18.00).\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line to the specified coordinates.\n\n2. **Listing the Points:**\n   - Start at (51.00, 18.00).\n   - Draw a line to (5.00, 62.00).\n   - Draw a line to (37.00, 63.00).\n   - Draw a line to (53.00, 71.00).\n   - Draw a line to (52.00, 55.00).\n   - Draw a line to (65.00, 31.00).\n   - Finally, draw a line back to the starting point (51.00, 18.00).\n\n3. **Counting the Sides:**\n   - The path consists of six `L` commands, which means it has six sides.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A shape with six sides is a hexagon.\n\n5. **Cross-Verification:**\n   - The path returns to the starting point, confirming it is a closed shape.\n   - The number of sides matches the definition of a hexagon.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the shape drawn by the SVG path is a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
