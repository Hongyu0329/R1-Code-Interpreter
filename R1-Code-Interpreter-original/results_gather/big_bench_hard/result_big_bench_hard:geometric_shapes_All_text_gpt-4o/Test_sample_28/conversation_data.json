    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step. The path data is given as:\n\n`M 50.91,18.41 L 57.39,58.34 L 25.82,45.12 L 33.11,31.36 L 26.90,27.04 L 29.87,20.84 M 29.87,20.84 L 50.91,18.41`\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **M 50.91,18.41**: This command moves the pen to the starting point (50.91, 18.41).\n\n2. **L 57.39,58.34**: This draws a line from the current point (50.91, 18.41) to (57.39, 58.34).\n\n3. **L 25.82,45.12**: This draws a line from (57.39, 58.34) to (25.82, 45.12).\n\n4. **L 33.11,31.36**: This draws a line from (25.82, 45.12) to (33.11, 31.36).\n\n5. **L 26.90,27.04**: This draws a line from (33.11, 31.36) to (26.90, 27.04).\n\n6. **L 29.87,20.84**: This draws a line from (26.90, 27.04) to (29.87, 20.84).\n\n7. **M 29.87,20.84**: This moves the pen to (29.87, 20.84) without drawing a line.\n\n8. **L 50.91,18.41**: This draws a line from (29.87, 20.84) to (50.91, 18.41), which is the starting point.\n\nNow, let's analyze the shape:\n\n- The path consists of a series of line segments connecting a sequence of points.\n- The path does not close automatically, but the last line segment connects back to the starting point, effectively closing the shape.\n- The path consists of 6 line segments, forming a closed shape with 6 vertices.\n\nGiven these observations, the shape formed by the path is a hexagon, as it has six sides and six vertices.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
