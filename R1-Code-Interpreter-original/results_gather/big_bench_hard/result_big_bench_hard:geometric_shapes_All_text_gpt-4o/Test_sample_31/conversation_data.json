    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 83.17,32.03 L 87.90,19.01 L 76.80,8.19 L 69.67,12.38 L 72.92,22.11 M 72.92,22.11 L 83.17,32.03`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path.\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - `M 83.17,32.03`: Move to the starting point (83.17, 32.03).\n   - `L 87.90,19.01`: Draw a line to (87.90, 19.01).\n   - `L 76.80,8.19`: Draw a line to (76.80, 8.19).\n   - `L 69.67,12.38`: Draw a line to (69.67, 12.38).\n   - `L 72.92,22.11`: Draw a line to (72.92, 22.11).\n   - `M 72.92,22.11`: Move to (72.92, 22.11) without drawing a line.\n   - `L 83.17,32.03`: Draw a line back to the starting point (83.17, 32.03).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Shape:**\n   - The path consists of five line segments connecting five points.\n   - The path returns to the starting point, forming a closed shape.\n   - The shape has five sides, which is characteristic of a pentagon.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The path forms a closed shape with five sides, which matches the definition of a pentagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a pentagon.\n\n<<<G>>>"
