    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 25.26,65.86 L 39.41,66.15 L 17.14,36.90 M 17.14,36.90 L 13.78,49.25 L 0.26,46.02 L 29.07,84.32 L 25.26,65.86`.\n   - `M` indicates a \"move to\" command, which sets the starting point of the path.\n   - `L` indicates a \"line to\" command, which draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - The path starts at `(25.26, 65.86)`.\n   - Draws a line to `(39.41, 66.15)`.\n   - Draws a line to `(17.14, 36.90)`.\n   - Moves to `(17.14, 36.90)` (this is a repeat, so no new line is drawn).\n   - Draws a line to `(13.78, 49.25)`.\n   - Draws a line to `(0.26, 46.02)`.\n   - Draws a line to `(29.07, 84.32)`.\n   - Draws a line back to the starting point `(25.26, 65.86)`.\n\n3. **Counting the Vertices:**\n   - The path consists of the following vertices: `(25.26, 65.86)`, `(39.41, 66.15)`, `(17.14, 36.90)`, `(13.78, 49.25)`, `(0.26, 46.02)`, `(29.07, 84.32)`.\n   - There are 6 unique vertices.\n\n4. **Determining the Shape:**\n   - A shape with 6 vertices is a hexagon.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the SVG path element draws a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
