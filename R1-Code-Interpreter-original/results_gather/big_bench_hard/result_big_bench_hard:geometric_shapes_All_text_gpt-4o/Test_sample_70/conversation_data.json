    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 21.22,43.76 L 13.59,7.93 L 49.15,35.84 M 49.15,35.84 L 21.22,43.76`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path.\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - `M 21.22,43.76`: Move to the point (21.22, 43.76).\n   - `L 13.59,7.93`: Draw a line from (21.22, 43.76) to (13.59, 7.93).\n   - `L 49.15,35.84`: Draw a line from (13.59, 7.93) to (49.15, 35.84).\n   - `M 49.15,35.84`: Move to the point (49.15, 35.84) again.\n   - `L 21.22,43.76`: Draw a line from (49.15, 35.84) to (21.22, 43.76).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Path:**\n   - The path starts at (21.22, 43.76), goes to (13.59, 7.93), then to (49.15, 35.84), and finally back to (21.22, 43.76).\n   - This forms a closed shape with three sides.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A closed shape with three sides is a triangle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The SVG path element draws a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<J>>>"
