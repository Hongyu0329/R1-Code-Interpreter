    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 73.00,72.00 L 9.00,72.00 L 9.00,37.00 L 73.00,37.00 L 73.00,72.00`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path.\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - `M 73.00,72.00`: Move to the point (73, 72).\n   - `L 9.00,72.00`: Draw a line from (73, 72) to (9, 72).\n   - `L 9.00,37.00`: Draw a line from (9, 72) to (9, 37).\n   - `L 73.00,37.00`: Draw a line from (9, 37) to (73, 37).\n   - `L 73.00,72.00`: Draw a line from (73, 37) to (73, 72), closing the path.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Shape:**\n   - The path starts at (73, 72) and ends at (73, 72), indicating a closed shape.\n   - The lines form a shape with four corners: (73, 72), (9, 72), (9, 37), and (73, 37).\n   - The opposite sides are parallel and equal in length: \n     - The top and bottom sides are horizontal lines from (9, 72) to (73, 72) and from (9, 37) to (73, 37), respectively.\n     - The left and right sides are vertical lines from (9, 72) to (9, 37) and from (73, 72) to (73, 37), respectively.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - The shape has four sides with opposite sides being equal and parallel, which is the definition of a rectangle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the SVG path element draws a rectangle.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<H>>>."
