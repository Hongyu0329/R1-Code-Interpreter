    "To determine the shape drawn by the given SVG path element, we need to analyze the path data step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 22.00,62.00 L 46.00,65.00 L 64.00,60.00 L 91.00,42.00 L 92.00,24.00 L 46.00,19.00 L 22.00,62.00`.\n   - `M` indicates the starting point of the path: (22.00, 62.00).\n   - `L` indicates a line to the specified point.\n\n2. **Listing the Points:**\n   - Start at (22.00, 62.00).\n   - Draw a line to (46.00, 65.00).\n   - Draw a line to (64.00, 60.00).\n   - Draw a line to (91.00, 42.00).\n   - Draw a line to (92.00, 24.00).\n   - Draw a line to (46.00, 19.00).\n   - Finally, draw a line back to the starting point (22.00, 62.00).\n\n3. **Counting the Sides:**\n   - The path consists of six line segments connecting seven points.\n   - The path returns to the starting point, forming a closed shape.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A shape with six sides is a hexagon.\n\n5. **Verifying the Options:**\n   - (A) circle: Incorrect, as a circle is not formed by straight lines.\n   - (B) heptagon: Incorrect, a heptagon has seven sides.\n   - (C) hexagon: Correct, a hexagon has six sides.\n   - (D) kite: Incorrect, a kite is a quadrilateral.\n   - (E) line: Incorrect, the path forms a closed shape.\n   - (F) octagon: Incorrect, an octagon has eight sides.\n   - (G) pentagon: Incorrect, a pentagon has five sides.\n   - (H) rectangle: Incorrect, a rectangle has four sides.\n   - (I) sector: Incorrect, a sector is a part of a circle.\n   - (J) triangle: Incorrect, a triangle has three sides.\n\nBased on the analysis, the shape drawn by the SVG path element is a hexagon.\n\nFinal answer: <<<hexagon>>>."
