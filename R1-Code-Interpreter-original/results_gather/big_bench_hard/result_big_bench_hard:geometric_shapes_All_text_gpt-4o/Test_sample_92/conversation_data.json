    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data is given as: `M 43.79,3.46 L 66.68,10.86 L 56.02,58.65 L 43.79,3.46`.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point of the path at coordinates (43.79, 3.46).\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a straight line to the specified coordinates.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - The path starts at (43.79, 3.46).\n   - A line is drawn to (66.68, 10.86).\n   - Another line is drawn to (56.02, 58.65).\n   - Finally, a line is drawn back to the starting point (43.79, 3.46), closing the shape.\n\n3. **Counting the Sides:**\n   - The path consists of three line segments connecting four points, but since the last point is the same as the first, it effectively connects three distinct points.\n   - This forms a closed shape with three sides.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A closed shape with three sides is a triangle.\n\n5. **Verifying the Options:**\n   - The options provided are: circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle.\n   - Among these, the only shape with three sides is a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a triangle.\n\n<<<triangle>>>"
