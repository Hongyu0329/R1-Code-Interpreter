    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the SVG Path Data:**\n   - The path data consists of a series of commands and coordinates.\n   - `M` stands for \"move to\" and sets the starting point.\n   - `L` stands for \"line to\" and draws a line from the current point to the specified point.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Path:**\n   - `M 59.64,77.72` - Move to the starting point (59.64, 77.72).\n   - `L 75.18,56.50` - Draw a line to (75.18, 56.50).\n   - `M 75.18,56.50` - Move to (75.18, 56.50) (this is redundant as it's already the current point).\n   - `L 6.90,59.13` - Draw a line to (6.90, 59.13).\n   - `M 6.90,59.13` - Move to (6.90, 59.13) (again redundant).\n   - `L 22.09,77.44` - Draw a line to (22.09, 77.44).\n   - `M 22.09,77.44` - Move to (22.09, 77.44) (again redundant).\n   - `L 2.73,94.57` - Draw a line to (2.73, 94.57).\n   - `M 2.73,94.57` - Move to (2.73, 94.57) (again redundant).\n   - `L 91.78,91.66` - Draw a line to (91.78, 91.66).\n   - `M 91.78,91.66` - Move to (91.78, 91.66) (again redundant).\n   - `L 59.64,77.72` - Draw a line back to the starting point (59.64, 77.72).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Shape:**\n   - The path consists of a series of lines connecting six distinct points.\n   - The path returns to the starting point, forming a closed shape.\n   - The shape has six sides, which is characteristic of a hexagon.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The path forms a closed shape with six sides, which matches the definition of a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the SVG path element draws a hexagon.\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
