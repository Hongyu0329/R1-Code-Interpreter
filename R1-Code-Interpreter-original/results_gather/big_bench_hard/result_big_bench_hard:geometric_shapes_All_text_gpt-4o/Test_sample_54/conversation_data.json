    "To determine what shape the given SVG path element draws, we need to analyze the path data step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Path Data:**\n   - The path data starts with `M 64.00,63.00`, which means \"move to\" the point (64, 63).\n   - `L 44.00,63.00` means \"line to\" the point (44, 63).\n   - `L 44.00,50.00` means \"line to\" the point (44, 50).\n   - `L 64.00,50.00` means \"line to\" the point (64, 50).\n   - `L 64.00,37.00` means \"line to\" the point (64, 37).\n   - `L 85.00,57.00` means \"line to\" the point (85, 57).\n   - `L 64.00,76.00` means \"line to\" the point (64, 76).\n   - `L 64.00,63.00` means \"line to\" the point (64, 63), which closes the path.\n\n2. **Plotting the Points:**\n   - Start at (64, 63).\n   - Draw a line to (44, 63).\n   - Draw a line to (44, 50).\n   - Draw a line to (64, 50).\n   - Draw a line to (64, 37).\n   - Draw a line to (85, 57).\n   - Draw a line to (64, 76).\n   - Finally, draw a line back to the starting point (64, 63).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Shape:**\n   - The path forms a closed shape with seven distinct points.\n   - The points form a shape with seven sides.\n\n4. **Identifying the Shape:**\n   - A shape with seven sides is called a heptagon.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The SVG path element draws a heptagon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<heptagon>>>"
