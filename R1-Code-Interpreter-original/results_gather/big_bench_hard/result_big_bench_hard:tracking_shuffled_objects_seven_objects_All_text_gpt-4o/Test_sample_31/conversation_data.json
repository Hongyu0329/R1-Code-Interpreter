    "To solve this problem, we need to track the partner changes step by step. Let's start by listing the initial pairings:\n\n- Alice with Patrick\n- Bob with Lola\n- Claire with Izzi\n- Dave with Rodrigo\n- Eve with Helga\n- Fred with Sam\n- Gertrude with Melissa\n\nNow, let's go through each partner switch:\n\n1. **Eve and Bob switch partners:**\n   - Eve is now with Lola\n   - Bob is now with Helga\n\n2. **Eve and Dave switch partners:**\n   - Eve is now with Rodrigo\n   - Dave is now with Lola\n\n3. **Fred and Gertrude switch partners:**\n   - Fred is now with Melissa\n   - Gertrude is now with Sam\n\n4. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Gertrude is now with Patrick\n   - Alice is now with Sam\n\n5. **Alice and Dave switch partners:**\n   - Alice is now with Lola\n   - Dave is now with Sam\n\n6. **Claire and Alice switch partners:**\n   - Claire is now with Lola\n   - Alice is now with Izzi\n\n7. **Alice and Dave switch partners:**\n   - Alice is now with Sam\n   - Dave is now with Izzi\n\nAt the end of the dance, we need to determine who Eve is dancing with. From the steps above, we see that Eve's last partner change was in step 2, where she ended up with Rodrigo. There are no further changes involving Eve, so she remains with Rodrigo.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Rodrigo>>>"
