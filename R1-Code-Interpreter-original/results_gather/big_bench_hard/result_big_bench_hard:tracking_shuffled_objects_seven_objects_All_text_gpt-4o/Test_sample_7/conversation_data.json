    "To determine which ball Dave has at the end of the game, we need to track the movement of the balls through each swap. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Ball Distribution:**\n   - Alice: Purple\n   - Bob: Green\n   - Claire: Pink\n   - Dave: Red\n   - Eve: Blue\n   - Fred: White\n   - Gertrude: Black\n\n2. **First Swap (Eve and Dave):**\n   - Eve: Red\n   - Dave: Blue\n\n3. **Second Swap (Eve and Fred):**\n   - Eve: White\n   - Fred: Red\n\n4. **Third Swap (Eve and Dave):**\n   - Eve: Blue\n   - Dave: White\n\n5. **Fourth Swap (Eve and Alice):**\n   - Eve: Purple\n   - Alice: Blue\n\n6. **Fifth Swap (Bob and Alice):**\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Alice: Green\n\n7. **Sixth Swap (Gertrude and Claire):**\n   - Gertrude: Pink\n   - Claire: Black\n\n8. **Seventh Swap (Alice and Dave):**\n   - Alice: White\n   - Dave: Green\n\nAfter all the swaps, the final ball distribution is:\n- Alice: White\n- Bob: Blue\n- Claire: Black\n- Dave: Green\n- Eve: Purple\n- Fred: Red\n- Gertrude: Pink\n\nTherefore, at the end of the game, Dave has the green ball.\n\nThe answer is: <<<B) green ball>>>."
