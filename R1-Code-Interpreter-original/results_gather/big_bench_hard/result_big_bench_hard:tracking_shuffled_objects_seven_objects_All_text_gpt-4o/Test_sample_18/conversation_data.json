    "To determine which ball Alice has at the end of the game, we need to track the movement of the balls through each swap. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Ball Distribution:**\n   - Alice: Green\n   - Bob: Orange\n   - Claire: White\n   - Dave: Pink\n   - Eve: Blue\n   - Fred: Yellow\n   - Gertrude: Black\n\n2. **First Swap (Eve and Gertrude):**\n   - Eve: Black\n   - Gertrude: Blue\n\n3. **Second Swap (Fred and Bob):**\n   - Fred: Orange\n   - Bob: Yellow\n\n4. **Third Swap (Fred and Claire):**\n   - Fred: White\n   - Claire: Orange\n\n5. **Fourth Swap (Eve and Fred):**\n   - Eve: White\n   - Fred: Black\n\n6. **Fifth Swap (Fred and Claire):**\n   - Fred: Orange\n   - Claire: Black\n\n7. **Sixth Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Yellow\n   - Bob: Green\n\n8. **Seventh Swap (Dave and Gertrude):**\n   - Dave: Blue\n   - Gertrude: Pink\n\nAfter all the swaps, the final distribution of balls is:\n- Alice: Yellow\n- Bob: Green\n- Claire: Black\n- Dave: Blue\n- Eve: White\n- Fred: Orange\n- Gertrude: Pink\n\nTherefore, at the end of the game, Alice has the yellow ball.\n\nThe answer is: <<<F>>>."
