    "To determine which ball Alice has at the end of the game, we need to track the movement of the balls through each swap. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Ball Distribution:**\n   - Alice: Black\n   - Bob: Blue\n   - Claire: Red\n   - Dave: Purple\n   - Eve: Pink\n   - Fred: Brown\n   - Gertrude: White\n\n2. **Fred and Gertrude swap balls:**\n   - Fred: White\n   - Gertrude: Brown\n\n3. **Fred and Alice swap balls:**\n   - Fred: Black\n   - Alice: White\n\n4. **Alice and Claire swap balls:**\n   - Alice: Red\n   - Claire: White\n\n5. **Bob and Dave swap balls:**\n   - Bob: Purple\n   - Dave: Blue\n\n6. **Fred and Eve swap balls:**\n   - Fred: Pink\n   - Eve: Black\n\n7. **Gertrude and Fred swap balls:**\n   - Gertrude: Pink\n   - Fred: Brown\n\n8. **Gertrude and Bob swap balls:**\n   - Gertrude: Purple\n   - Bob: Pink\n\nNow, let's check the final ball that Alice has:\n- After all the swaps, Alice has the Red ball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
