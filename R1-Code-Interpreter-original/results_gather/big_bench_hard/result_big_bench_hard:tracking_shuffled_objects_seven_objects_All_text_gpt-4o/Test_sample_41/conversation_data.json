    "To determine which present Gertrude has at the end of the event, we need to track the movement of the presents through each swap. Let's go through the swaps step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Distribution:**\n   - Alice: Red\n   - Bob: Purple\n   - Claire: White\n   - Dave: Brown\n   - Eve: Green\n   - Fred: Blue\n   - Gertrude: Yellow\n\n2. **First Swap (Dave and Bob):**\n   - Dave: Purple\n   - Bob: Brown\n\n3. **Second Swap (Alice and Bob):**\n   - Alice: Brown\n   - Bob: Red\n\n4. **Third Swap (Gertrude and Alice):**\n   - Gertrude: Brown\n   - Alice: Yellow\n\n5. **Fourth Swap (Claire and Alice):**\n   - Claire: Yellow\n   - Alice: White\n\n6. **Fifth Swap (Bob and Dave):**\n   - Bob: Purple\n   - Dave: Red\n\n7. **Sixth Swap (Fred and Alice):**\n   - Fred: White\n   - Alice: Blue\n\n8. **Seventh Swap (Fred and Eve):**\n   - Fred: Green\n   - Eve: White\n\nNow, let's determine what present Gertrude has at the end of the event. After the third swap, Gertrude had the Brown present, and there were no further swaps involving Gertrude. Therefore, Gertrude still has the Brown present at the end of the event.\n\nThe answer is: <<<brown present>>>."
