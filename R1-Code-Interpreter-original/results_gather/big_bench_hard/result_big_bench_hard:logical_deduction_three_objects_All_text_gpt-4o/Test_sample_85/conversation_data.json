    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the convertible, the limousine, and the bus. We are given two pieces of information:\n\n1. The limousine is older than the bus.\n2. The bus is older than the convertible.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- From the first statement, \"The limousine is older than the bus,\" we can infer that the limousine is not the newest vehicle. This means the limousine is either the oldest or the second oldest.\n\n- From the second statement, \"The bus is older than the convertible,\" we can infer that the bus is not the newest vehicle. This means the bus is either the oldest or the second oldest.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can establish the following order of ages from oldest to newest:\n\n- Limousine (older than the bus)\n- Bus (older than the convertible)\n- Convertible (newest)\n\nThus, the convertible is the newest vehicle among the three.\n\nNow, let's match this conclusion with the given options:\n\n(A) The convertible is the newest\n(B) The limousine is the newest\n(C) The bus is the newest\n\nThe correct option that matches our conclusion is (A) The convertible is the newest.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
