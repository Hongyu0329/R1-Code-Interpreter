    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine the correct order of the books on the shelf. Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Books:**\n   - There are three books: a brown book, a yellow book, and an orange book.\n\n2. **Statement Analysis:**\n   - \"The yellow book is the leftmost.\" This means the yellow book is positioned at the far left on the shelf.\n   - \"The orange book is to the right of the brown book.\" This means the brown book is positioned to the left of the orange book.\n\n3. **Determine the Order:**\n   - Since the yellow book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n   - The brown book must be to the left of the orange book, so the brown book cannot be the rightmost.\n   - Given the yellow book is already the leftmost, the brown book must be in the middle position, and the orange book must be the rightmost.\n\n4. **Final Order:**\n   - Yellow book (leftmost), Brown book (middle), Orange book (rightmost).\n\n5. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - (A) The brown book is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the yellow book is the leftmost.\n   - (B) The yellow book is the leftmost: This is correct as per the given statement.\n   - (C) The orange book is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the yellow book is the leftmost.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
