    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Identify the vehicles and their relative ages:**\n   - We have three vehicles: a motorcycle, a bus, and a tractor.\n\n2. **Analyze the first statement:**\n   - \"The motorcycle is the oldest.\"\n   - This means the motorcycle is older than both the bus and the tractor.\n\n3. **Analyze the second statement:**\n   - \"The bus is newer than the tractor.\"\n   - This means the bus is younger than the tractor.\n\n4. **Determine the order from oldest to newest:**\n   - Since the motorcycle is the oldest, it is the first in the order.\n   - The bus is newer than the tractor, so the tractor must be older than the bus.\n   - Therefore, the order from oldest to newest is: Motorcycle, Tractor, Bus.\n\n5. **Determine which vehicle is the newest:**\n   - From the order determined, the bus is the newest vehicle.\n\n6. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states the motorcycle is the newest, which is incorrect.\n   - Option (B) states the bus is the newest, which matches our conclusion.\n   - Option (C) states the tractor is the newest, which is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The bus is the newest"
