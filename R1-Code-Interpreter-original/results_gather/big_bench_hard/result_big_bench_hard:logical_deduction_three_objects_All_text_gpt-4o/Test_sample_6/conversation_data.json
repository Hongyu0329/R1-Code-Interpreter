    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the tractor, the truck, and the minivan, based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Statement Analysis:**\n   - \"The minivan is newer than the truck.\" This means the minivan is younger than the truck.\n   - \"The tractor is older than the truck.\" This means the tractor is older than the truck.\n\n2. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - From the first statement, we know: Minivan < Truck (in terms of age, where \"<\" means \"is newer than\").\n   - From the second statement, we know: Tractor > Truck (in terms of age, where \">\" means \"is older than\").\n\n3. **Arranging the Vehicles by Age:**\n   - Since the minivan is newer than the truck, and the tractor is older than the truck, the logical order from oldest to newest is: Tractor > Truck > Minivan.\n\n4. **Determining the Newest Vehicle:**\n   - Based on the order: Tractor > Truck > Minivan, the minivan is the newest vehicle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct option that identifies the newest vehicle is (C) The minivan is the newest.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
