    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the information provided in the paragraph.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relative prices:**\n   - We have three fruits: loquats, mangoes, and apples.\n   - The mangoes are more expensive than the apples.\n   - The loquats are more expensive than the mangoes.\n\n2. **Establish the order of prices:**\n   - Since mangoes are more expensive than apples, we can write this as: Mangoes > Apples.\n   - Since loquats are more expensive than mangoes, we can write this as: Loquats > Mangoes.\n\n3. **Combine the information:**\n   - From the above two points, we can establish the complete order: Loquats > Mangoes > Apples.\n\n4. **Determine which fruit is the second-most expensive:**\n   - In the order Loquats > Mangoes > Apples, the mangoes are in the middle position, making them the second-most expensive fruit.\n\n5. **Match with the options:**\n   - (A) The loquats are the second-most expensive. (Incorrect, as loquats are the most expensive)\n   - (B) The mangoes are the second-most expensive. (Correct, as determined above)\n   - (C) The apples are the second-most expensive. (Incorrect, as apples are the least expensive)\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
