    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relative prices:**\n   - We have three fruits: plums, apples, and loquats.\n   - The loquats are the cheapest.\n   - The plums are less expensive than the apples.\n\n2. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - Since the loquats are the cheapest, they are at the bottom of the price list.\n   - The plums are less expensive than the apples, which means the apples are more expensive than the plums.\n\n3. **Arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:**\n   - Loquats (cheapest)\n   - Plums\n   - Apples (most expensive)\n\n4. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) The plums are the most expensive: This is incorrect because the apples are more expensive than the plums.\n   - (B) The apples are the most expensive: This is correct based on the analysis.\n   - (C) The loquats are the most expensive: This is incorrect because the loquats are the cheapest.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the given information and the analysis, the apples are the most expensive fruit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The apples are the most expensive"
