    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given in the paragraph and match it with the options provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Paragraph:**\n   - The fruit stand sells three types of fruits: cantaloupes, watermelons, and mangoes.\n   - The mangoes are the cheapest.\n   - The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\n2. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - Since the mangoes are the cheapest, they are less expensive than both the cantaloupes and the watermelons.\n   - The cantaloupes being the second-most expensive means they are more expensive than the mangoes but less expensive than the watermelons.\n   - Therefore, the order of the fruits from cheapest to most expensive is: mangoes, cantaloupes, watermelons.\n\n3. **Matching with Options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the cantaloupes are the cheapest. This contradicts the paragraph because the mangoes are the cheapest.\n   - Option (B) states that the watermelons are the cheapest. This also contradicts the paragraph because the mangoes are the cheapest.\n   - Option (C) states that the mangoes are the cheapest. This is consistent with the paragraph.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct option that matches the information given in the paragraph is Option (C).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
