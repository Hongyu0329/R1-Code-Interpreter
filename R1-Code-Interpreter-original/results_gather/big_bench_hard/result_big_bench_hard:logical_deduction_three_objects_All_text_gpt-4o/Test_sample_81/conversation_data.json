    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished in the tournament based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Identify the golfers and their relative positions:**\n   - The golfers are Amy, Ana, and Joe.\n   - We have two statements about their finishing positions:\n     - Amy finished below Ana.\n     - Ana finished below Joe.\n\n2. **Analyze the statements:**\n   - \"Amy finished below Ana\" implies that Ana finished in a higher position than Amy.\n   - \"Ana finished below Joe\" implies that Joe finished in a higher position than Ana.\n\n3. **Determine the order of finish:**\n   - Since Joe finished above Ana, and Ana finished above Amy, the order from highest to lowest is:\n     1. Joe\n     2. Ana\n     3. Amy\n\n4. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) Amy finished second: This is incorrect because Amy finished third.\n   - (B) Ana finished second: This is correct because Ana finished in the middle position.\n   - (C) Joe finished second: This is incorrect because Joe finished first.\n\n5. **Select the correct answer:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the correct answer is that Ana finished second.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
