    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the arrangement of the books and determine which option correctly describes the position of the books.\n\n1. **Identify the Books and Their Positions:**\n   - We have three books: a red book, a blue book, and an orange book.\n   - The red book is to the left of the orange book.\n   - The orange book is the second from the left.\n\n2. **Determine the Positions Based on the Given Information:**\n   - Since the orange book is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n   - The red book is to the left of the orange book, so the red book must be in the first position (leftmost).\n   - This leaves the blue book to be in the third position (rightmost).\n\n3. **Verify the Arrangement:**\n   - First position: Red book\n   - Second position: Orange book\n   - Third position: Blue book\n\n4. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - (A) The red book is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the red book is in the first position.\n   - (B) The blue book is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the blue book is in the third position.\n   - (C) The orange book is the second from the left: This is correct because the orange book is indeed in the second position.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
