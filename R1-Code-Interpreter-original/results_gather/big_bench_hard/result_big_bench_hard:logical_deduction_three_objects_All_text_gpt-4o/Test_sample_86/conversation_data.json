    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the positions based on the given conditions:**\n   - We have three books: green, red, and blue.\n   - The red book is the rightmost. This means the red book is in the third position from the left.\n   - The blue book is to the right of the green book. This means the blue book cannot be in the first position, as it must be to the right of the green book.\n\n2. **Determine the possible order:**\n   - Since the red book is the rightmost, it is in the third position.\n   - The blue book must be to the right of the green book, so the green book cannot be in the third position.\n   - The only possible order that satisfies both conditions is:\n     - Green book in the first position\n     - Blue book in the second position\n     - Red book in the third position\n\n3. **Identify the book that is second from the left:**\n   - Based on the order determined above, the blue book is in the second position from the left.\n\n4. **Match the order with the options provided:**\n   - (A) The green book is the second from the left - Incorrect, as the green book is first.\n   - (B) The red book is the second from the left - Incorrect, as the red book is third.\n   - (C) The blue book is the second from the left - Correct, as the blue book is indeed second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
