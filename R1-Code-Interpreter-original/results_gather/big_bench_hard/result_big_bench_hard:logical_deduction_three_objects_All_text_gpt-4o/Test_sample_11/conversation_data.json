    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the second-most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relative prices:**\n   - We have three fruits: peaches, mangoes, and apples.\n   - The peaches are more expensive than the apples.\n   - The mangoes are the cheapest.\n\n2. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - Since the mangoes are the cheapest, they must be the least expensive of the three fruits.\n   - The peaches are more expensive than the apples, which means the apples are less expensive than the peaches.\n\n3. **Establish the price ranking:**\n   - Given that mangoes are the cheapest, they are ranked last in terms of price.\n   - Since peaches are more expensive than apples, peaches are ranked first, and apples are ranked second.\n\n4. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - From the established ranking, the order from most expensive to least expensive is: Peaches, Apples, Mangoes.\n   - Therefore, the apples are the second-most expensive fruit.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (C) states that the apples are the second-most expensive, which matches our analysis.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
