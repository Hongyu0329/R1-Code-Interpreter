    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the conditions in the paragraph.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relative prices:**\n   - We have three fruits: loquats, watermelons, and cantaloupes.\n   - We know that watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n   - We also know that loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n\n2. **Analyze the given conditions:**\n   - Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, they cannot be the most expensive or the least expensive.\n   - Loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes, which means loquats cannot be the least expensive.\n\n3. **Determine the possible order:**\n   - Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, the only positions left for loquats and cantaloupes are the most expensive and the least expensive.\n   - Given that loquats are more expensive than cantaloupes, loquats must be the most expensive, and cantaloupes must be the least expensive.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The order from most expensive to least expensive is: loquats, watermelons, cantaloupes.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (A) states that the loquats are the most expensive, which matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The loquats are the most expensive"
