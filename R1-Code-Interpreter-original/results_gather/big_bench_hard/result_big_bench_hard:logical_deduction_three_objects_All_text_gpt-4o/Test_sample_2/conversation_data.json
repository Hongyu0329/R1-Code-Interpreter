    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given information and then identify which book is second from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the positions of the books:**\n   - We have three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a red book.\n   - The blue book is the rightmost. This means the blue book is in the third position from the left.\n   - The orange book is the leftmost. This means the orange book is in the first position from the left.\n\n2. **Determine the position of the red book:**\n   - Since the blue book is in the third position and the orange book is in the first position, the only position left for the red book is the second position from the left.\n\n3. **Verify the positions:**\n   - First position: Orange book\n   - Second position: Red book\n   - Third position: Blue book\n\n4. **Identify the book that is second from the left:**\n   - Based on the positions determined, the red book is second from the left.\n\n5. **Match the answer with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states the blue book is the second from the left, which is incorrect.\n   - Option (B) states the orange book is the second from the left, which is incorrect.\n   - Option (C) states the red book is the second from the left, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
