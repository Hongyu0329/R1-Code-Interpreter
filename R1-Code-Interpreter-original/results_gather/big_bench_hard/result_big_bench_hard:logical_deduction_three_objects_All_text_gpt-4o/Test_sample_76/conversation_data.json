    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Eve finished below Eli.\"\n   - This means Eli finished in a higher position than Eve. So, Eli is not last, and Eve is not first.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"Eve finished above Mya.\"\n   - This means Eve finished in a higher position than Mya. So, Mya is not first, and Eve is not last.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to determine the order:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know Eli is above Eve.\n- From Statement 2, we know Eve is above Mya.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible order is:\n1. Eli\n2. Eve\n3. Mya\n\nTherefore, Mya finished last.\n\nNow, let's match this conclusion with the options provided:\n\n(A) Eli finished last - This is incorrect because Eli finished first.\n(B) Mya finished last - This is correct because Mya finished third.\n(C) Eve finished last - This is incorrect because Eve finished second.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
