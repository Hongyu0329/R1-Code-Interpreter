    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the convertible, the motorcycle, and the truck, based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Understand the Statements:**\n   - The motorcycle is newer than the convertible.\n   - The convertible is newer than the truck.\n\n2. **Translate the Statements into Order:**\n   - If the motorcycle is newer than the convertible, it means the convertible is older than the motorcycle.\n   - If the convertible is newer than the truck, it means the truck is older than the convertible.\n\n3. **Determine the Order of Ages:**\n   - From the first statement, we have: Motorcycle > Convertible (in terms of newness, which means older in terms of age).\n   - From the second statement, we have: Convertible > Truck (in terms of newness, which means older in terms of age).\n\n4. **Combine the Information:**\n   - Combining both statements, we get the order of ages as: Motorcycle (newest) > Convertible > Truck (oldest).\n\n5. **Analyze the Options:**\n   - (A) The convertible is the oldest: This is incorrect because the truck is older than the convertible.\n   - (B) The motorcycle is the oldest: This is incorrect because the motorcycle is the newest.\n   - (C) The truck is the oldest: This is correct because the truck is older than both the convertible and the motorcycle.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the logical order derived from the statements, the truck is the oldest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
