    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the positions of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements and determine which option correctly describes the position of the birds.\n\n1. **Identify the birds and their positions:**\n   - There are three birds: a hawk, a crow, and a raven.\n   - The raven is to the right of the hawk.\n   - The crow is the rightmost bird.\n\n2. **Determine the possible positions:**\n   - Since the crow is the rightmost, it must be in the third position.\n   - The raven is to the right of the hawk, which means the hawk cannot be in the third position. Therefore, the hawk must be in the first or second position.\n   - Since the crow is in the third position, the raven must be in the second position because it is to the right of the hawk.\n\n3. **Assign positions based on the above analysis:**\n   - First position: Hawk\n   - Second position: Raven\n   - Third position: Crow\n\n4. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) The hawk is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the hawk is in the first position.\n   - (B) The crow is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the crow is in the third position.\n   - (C) The raven is the second from the left: This is correct because the raven is in the second position.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
