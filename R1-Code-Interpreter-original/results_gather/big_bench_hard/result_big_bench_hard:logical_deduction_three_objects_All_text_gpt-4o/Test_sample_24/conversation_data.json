    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers—Eve, Joe, and Amy—finished in the tournament based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - \"Eve finished below Amy\": This means Amy finished in a higher position than Eve.\n   - \"Eve finished above Joe\": This means Eve finished in a higher position than Joe.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Order:**\n   - Since Eve finished below Amy, Amy cannot be in the last position. Therefore, Amy must be either first or second.\n   - Since Eve finished above Joe, Joe cannot be in the first or second position. Therefore, Joe must be in the last position.\n\n3. **Determining the Positions:**\n   - Given that Joe is in the last position, and Eve is above Joe, Eve must be in the second position.\n   - Since Eve is in the second position and Amy is above Eve, Amy must be in the first position.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The order of finishing is: Amy (first), Eve (second), Joe (third).\n\n5. **Selecting the Correct Option:**\n   - Based on the analysis, Amy finished first. Therefore, the correct option is (C) Amy finished first.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<C>>>."
