    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. There are three books: a gray book, a purple book, and a red book.\n2. The purple book is to the left of the red book.\n3. The gray book is to the left of the purple book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Condition 3 states that the gray book is to the left of the purple book. This means the gray book cannot be in the middle or the rightmost position; it must be to the left of the purple book.\n- Condition 2 states that the purple book is to the left of the red book. This means the purple book cannot be the rightmost book; it must be to the left of the red book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's determine the possible order:\n\n- The gray book must be to the left of both the purple and red books.\n- The purple book must be to the left of the red book.\n\nTherefore, the only possible order that satisfies all conditions is:\n1. Gray book (leftmost)\n2. Purple book (middle)\n3. Red book (rightmost)\n\nNow, let's match this order with the options provided:\n\n- Option (A): The gray book is the leftmost. This matches our determined order.\n- Option (B): The purple book is the leftmost. This does not match our determined order.\n- Option (C): The red book is the leftmost. This does not match our determined order.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
