    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Eve finished below Eli.\"\n   - This means Eli finished in a higher position than Eve. So, Eli is not in the last position, and Eve is not in the first position.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"Eve finished above Mya.\"\n   - This means Eve finished in a higher position than Mya. So, Mya is not in the first or second position.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- Since Eve is below Eli but above Mya, the only possible order is:\n  1. Eli\n  2. Eve\n  3. Mya\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option (A)**: Eli finished first.\n  - This is consistent with our deduced order: Eli is indeed in the first position.\n\n- **Option (B)**: Mya finished first.\n  - This is inconsistent with our deduced order: Mya is in the last position, not the first.\n\n- **Option (C)**: Eve finished first.\n  - This is inconsistent with our deduced order: Eve is in the second position, not the first.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the deduced order is Option (A).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
