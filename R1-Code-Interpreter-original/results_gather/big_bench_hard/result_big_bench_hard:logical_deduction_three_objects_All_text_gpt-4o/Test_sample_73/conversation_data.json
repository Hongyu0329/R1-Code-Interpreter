    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the statements in the paragraph.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - The kiwis are less expensive than the loquats.\n   - The cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into inequalities:**\n   - From \"The kiwis are less expensive than the loquats,\" we have: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Price of kiwis} < \\text{Price of loquats}\n     \\]\n   - From \"The cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis,\" we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Price of cantaloupes} < \\text{Price of kiwis}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - Since the cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis, and the kiwis are less expensive than the loquats, the order from least to most expensive is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cantaloupes} < \\text{Kiwis} < \\text{Loquats}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - In the order \\(\\text{Cantaloupes} < \\text{Kiwis} < \\text{Loquats}\\), the second-most expensive fruit is the kiwis.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (A) states that the kiwis are the second-most expensive, which matches our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
