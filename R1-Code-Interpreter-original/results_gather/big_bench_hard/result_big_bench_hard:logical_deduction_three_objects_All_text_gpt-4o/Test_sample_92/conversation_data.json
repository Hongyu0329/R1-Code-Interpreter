    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine the order of the vehicles based on their ages.\n\n1. **Identify the objects and their relationships:**\n   - We have three vehicles: a sedan, a tractor, and a bus.\n   - The relationships given are:\n     - The sedan is older than the tractor.\n     - The bus is older than the sedan.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into a logical order:**\n   - From \"The sedan is older than the tractor,\" we can infer:\n     - Sedan > Tractor\n   - From \"The bus is older than the sedan,\" we can infer:\n     - Bus > Sedan\n\n3. **Combine the relationships to determine the overall order:**\n   - We have:\n     - Bus > Sedan > Tractor\n\n4. **Determine which vehicle is the oldest:**\n   - From the order Bus > Sedan > Tractor, it is clear that the bus is the oldest vehicle.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (C) states that the bus is the oldest, which matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
