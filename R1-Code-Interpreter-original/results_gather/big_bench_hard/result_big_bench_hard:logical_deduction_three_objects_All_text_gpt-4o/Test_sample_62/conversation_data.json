    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. **Identify the books and their positions:**\n   - There are three books: a gray book, an orange book, and a brown book.\n\n2. **Analyze the given conditions:**\n   - The orange book is the leftmost. This means the orange book is in the first position.\n   - The gray book is to the right of the brown book. This means the brown book is to the left of the gray book.\n\n3. **Determine the possible positions:**\n   - Since the orange book is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n   - The remaining two positions (second and third) must be occupied by the brown and gray books.\n   - The condition that the gray book is to the right of the brown book implies that the brown book must be in the second position and the gray book in the third position.\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - First position: Orange book\n   - Second position: Brown book\n   - Third position: Gray book\n\n5. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) The gray book is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the gray book is in the third position.\n   - (B) The orange book is the second from the left: This is incorrect because the orange book is in the first position.\n   - (C) The brown book is the second from the left: This is correct because the brown book is in the second position.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
