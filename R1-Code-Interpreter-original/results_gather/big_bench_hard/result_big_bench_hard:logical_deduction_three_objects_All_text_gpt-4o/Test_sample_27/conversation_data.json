    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Identify the vehicles and their relative ages:**\n   - We have three vehicles: a hatchback, a convertible, and a tractor.\n\n2. **Analyze the given statements:**\n   - \"The convertible is older than the tractor.\"\n     - This means the convertible is not the newest, and the tractor is not the oldest.\n   - \"The hatchback is the second-newest.\"\n     - This means the hatchback is neither the oldest nor the newest.\n\n3. **Determine the possible order:**\n   - Since the hatchback is the second-newest, it must be in the middle position in terms of age.\n   - The convertible is older than the tractor, so the convertible cannot be the newest.\n   - Therefore, the only possible order is:\n     - Oldest: Convertible\n     - Second-newest: Hatchback\n     - Newest: Tractor\n\n4. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) The hatchback is the oldest: This is incorrect because the hatchback is the second-newest.\n   - (B) The convertible is the oldest: This is correct based on our analysis.\n   - (C) The tractor is the oldest: This is incorrect because the tractor is the newest.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
