    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the tractor, the station wagon, and the limousine, based on the given information.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - The tractor is newer than the limousine.\n   - The station wagon is the newest.\n\n2. **Analyze the relationships:**\n   - Since the station wagon is the newest, it means it is newer than both the tractor and the limousine.\n   - The tractor being newer than the limousine implies that the limousine is older than the tractor.\n\n3. **Determine the order from oldest to newest:**\n   - Since the station wagon is the newest, it is at the end of the order.\n   - The limousine is older than the tractor, so the order from oldest to newest is: Limousine, Tractor, Station Wagon.\n\n4. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) The tractor is the oldest: This is incorrect because the limousine is older than the tractor.\n   - (B) The station wagon is the oldest: This is incorrect because the station wagon is the newest.\n   - (C) The limousine is the oldest: This is correct because the limousine is older than both the tractor and the station wagon.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is that the limousine is the oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>> C"
