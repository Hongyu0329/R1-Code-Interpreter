    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the arrangement of the books and determine which option correctly describes the position of the leftmost book.\n\n1. **Identify the Books and Their Positions:**\n   - There are three books: an orange book, a white book, and a purple book.\n   - The orange book is to the left of the white book.\n   - The purple book is the rightmost.\n\n2. **Determine the Rightmost Book:**\n   - The purple book is explicitly stated to be the rightmost. This means it cannot be to the left of any other book.\n\n3. **Analyze the Position of the Orange and White Books:**\n   - Since the orange book is to the left of the white book, the order from left to right must be: orange book, white book.\n\n4. **Combine the Information:**\n   - Given that the purple book is the rightmost, the order of the books from left to right is: orange book, white book, purple book.\n\n5. **Determine the Leftmost Book:**\n   - From the order established (orange, white, purple), the orange book is the leftmost.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - (A) The orange book is the leftmost: This is consistent with our analysis.\n   - (B) The white book is the leftmost: This contradicts our analysis.\n   - (C) The purple book is the leftmost: This contradicts our analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
