    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers—Amy, Dan, and Mel—finished in the tournament based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - \"Mel finished above Amy\": This means Mel's position is better (numerically lower) than Amy's position.\n   - \"Dan finished below Amy\": This means Dan's position is worse (numerically higher) than Amy's position.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Possible Orders:**\n   - Since Mel finished above Amy, Mel cannot be in the last position. Therefore, Mel must be either first or second.\n   - Since Dan finished below Amy, Dan cannot be in the first or second position. Therefore, Dan must be in the third position.\n\n3. **Determining the Positions:**\n   - If Dan is in the third position, then Amy must be in the second position because Mel is above Amy.\n   - This leaves Mel to be in the first position.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the only consistent order with the given statements is Mel in first place, Amy in second place, and Dan in third place.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Mel finished first.\n\n<<<C>>>"
