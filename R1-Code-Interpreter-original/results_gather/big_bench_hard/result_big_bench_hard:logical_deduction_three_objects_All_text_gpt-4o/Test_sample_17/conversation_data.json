    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the arrangement of the books on the shelf and determine which option correctly describes the position of the rightmost book.\n\n1. **Identify the Books and Their Positions:**\n   - There are three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a red book.\n   - The blue book is described as the rightmost.\n   - The orange book is described as the leftmost.\n\n2. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Since the blue book is the rightmost, it must be at the far right end of the shelf.\n   - Since the orange book is the leftmost, it must be at the far left end of the shelf.\n   - This leaves the red book to be in the middle position between the orange book and the blue book.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - Option (A): The blue book is the rightmost. This is consistent with the given information.\n   - Option (B): The orange book is the rightmost. This contradicts the given information, as the orange book is the leftmost.\n   - Option (C): The red book is the rightmost. This contradicts the given information, as the blue book is the rightmost.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only option that is consistent with the given information is Option (A).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
