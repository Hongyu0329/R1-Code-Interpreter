    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine the correct order of the birds on the branch. Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the birds**: The three birds mentioned are a hawk, a cardinal, and a falcon.\n\n2. **Given conditions**:\n   - The hawk is to the left of the cardinal.\n   - The hawk is the second from the left.\n\n3. **Analyze the conditions**:\n   - Since the hawk is the second from the left, it cannot be the leftmost bird. Therefore, there must be one bird to the left of the hawk.\n   - The hawk is to the left of the cardinal, meaning the cardinal must be to the right of the hawk.\n\n4. **Determine the order**:\n   - Since the hawk is second from the left, the only possible order that satisfies all conditions is:\n     - First position: Falcon (since it is the only bird that can be to the left of the hawk)\n     - Second position: Hawk\n     - Third position: Cardinal\n\n5. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - (A) The hawk is the second from the left: This is consistent with our determined order.\n   - (B) The cardinal is the second from the left: This contradicts the given condition that the hawk is second from the left.\n   - (C) The falcon is the second from the left: This contradicts the given condition that the hawk is second from the left.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
