    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the cheapest.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - The mangoes are less expensive than the peaches.\n   - The apples are less expensive than the mangoes.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into inequalities:**\n   - Let A represent the price of apples, M represent the price of mangoes, and P represent the price of peaches.\n   - From the first statement, we have: M < P (mangoes are less expensive than peaches).\n   - From the second statement, we have: A < M (apples are less expensive than mangoes).\n\n3. **Combine the inequalities:**\n   - We have A < M and M < P.\n   - By transitive property, we can combine these to get: A < M < P.\n\n4. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - From the combined inequality A < M < P, it is clear that apples are the least expensive, followed by mangoes, and peaches are the most expensive.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (A) states that the apples are the cheapest, which aligns with our analysis.\n   - Option (B) states that the peaches are the cheapest, which contradicts our analysis.\n   - Option (C) states that the mangoes are the cheapest, which also contradicts our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the apples are the cheapest.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) The apples are the cheapest"
