    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which option is consistent with the statements.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relative prices:**\n   - We have three fruits: mangoes, watermelons, and kiwis.\n   - The watermelons are less expensive than the kiwis.\n   - The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\n2. **Analyze the statement \"The watermelons are less expensive than the kiwis\":**\n   - This means that the price of watermelons is lower than the price of kiwis.\n\n3. **Analyze the statement \"The kiwis are the second-most expensive\":**\n   - This implies that there is one fruit that is more expensive than the kiwis, and one fruit that is less expensive than the kiwis.\n\n4. **Determine the possible order of prices:**\n   - Since kiwis are the second-most expensive, there must be one fruit that is more expensive than kiwis and one that is less expensive.\n   - Given that watermelons are less expensive than kiwis, watermelons must be the least expensive.\n\n5. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - **Option (A): The mangoes are the most expensive.**\n     - If mangoes are the most expensive, then the order of prices would be: mangoes > kiwis > watermelons. This is consistent with the given statements.\n   - **Option (B): The watermelons are the most expensive.**\n     - This contradicts the statement that watermelons are less expensive than kiwis.\n   - **Option (C): The kiwis are the most expensive.**\n     - This contradicts the statement that kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only option that is consistent with all the given statements is Option (A), where mangoes are the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
