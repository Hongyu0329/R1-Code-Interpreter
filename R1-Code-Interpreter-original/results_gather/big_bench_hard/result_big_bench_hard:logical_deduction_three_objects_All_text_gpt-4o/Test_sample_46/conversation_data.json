    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the information provided in the paragraph.\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The oranges are the second-most expensive.\n   - The pears are more expensive than the watermelons.\n\n2. **Analyze the first statement:**\n   - \"The oranges are the second-most expensive\" means that there is one fruit more expensive than the oranges and one fruit less expensive than the oranges.\n\n3. **Analyze the second statement:**\n   - \"The pears are more expensive than the watermelons\" means that the pears cannot be the least expensive.\n\n4. **Combine the information:**\n   - Since the oranges are the second-most expensive, they cannot be the most or the least expensive.\n   - The pears, being more expensive than the watermelons, cannot be the least expensive. Therefore, the watermelons must be the least expensive.\n\n5. **Determine the order:**\n   - Since the watermelons are the least expensive, and the oranges are the second-most expensive, the pears must be the most expensive.\n\n6. **Verify with the options:**\n   - (A) The oranges are the most expensive: This is incorrect because the oranges are the second-most expensive.\n   - (B) The watermelons are the most expensive: This is incorrect because the watermelons are the least expensive.\n   - (C) The pears are the most expensive: This is correct based on our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
