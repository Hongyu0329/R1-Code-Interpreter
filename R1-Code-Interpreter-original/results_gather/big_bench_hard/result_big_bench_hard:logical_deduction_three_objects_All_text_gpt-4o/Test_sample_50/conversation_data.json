    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the arrangement of the books and determine which book is the leftmost on the shelf.\n\n1. **Identify the books and their relative positions:**\n   - There are three books: an orange book, a blue book, and a yellow book.\n   - The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n   - The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n\n2. **Determine the possible order of the books:**\n   - Since the orange book is to the left of the blue book, the orange book cannot be the rightmost book.\n   - Since the yellow book is to the right of the blue book, the yellow book cannot be the leftmost book.\n   - Therefore, the blue book must be between the orange book and the yellow book.\n\n3. **Arrange the books based on the given conditions:**\n   - The only possible order that satisfies all the conditions is: Orange Book, Blue Book, Yellow Book.\n\n4. **Determine which book is the leftmost:**\n   - In the order Orange Book, Blue Book, Yellow Book, the orange book is the leftmost.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (A) states that the orange book is the leftmost, which matches our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
