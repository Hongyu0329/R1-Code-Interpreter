    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints in the paragraph. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their order based on price:**\n   - We have three fruits: loquats, watermelons, and cantaloupes.\n\n2. **Given information:**\n   - The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n   - The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n\n3. **Analyze the constraints:**\n   - Since the watermelons are the second-most expensive, they cannot be the cheapest. This rules out option (B).\n   - The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes, which means the cantaloupes cannot be more expensive than the loquats.\n\n4. **Determine the order:**\n   - Since the watermelons are the second-most expensive, they are in the middle position.\n   - The loquats are more expensive than the cantaloupes, so the loquats must be the most expensive, and the cantaloupes must be the cheapest.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the order from most expensive to cheapest is: loquats, watermelons, cantaloupes.\n   - Therefore, the cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
