    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine the correct order of the birds on the branch. Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the birds**: The three birds mentioned are a robin, an owl, and a hawk.\n\n2. **Given conditions**:\n   - The robin is to the right of the hawk.\n   - The owl is the leftmost.\n\n3. **Analyze the conditions**:\n   - Since the owl is the leftmost, it must be the first bird in the order.\n   - The robin being to the right of the hawk means the hawk must be to the left of the robin.\n\n4. **Determine the order**:\n   - The owl is the leftmost, so it is first.\n   - The hawk must be to the left of the robin, so the hawk is second.\n   - The robin is to the right of the hawk, so the robin is third.\n\n5. **Final order**: Owl, Hawk, Robin.\n\n6. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - (A) The robin is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the owl is the leftmost.\n   - (B) The owl is the leftmost: This is correct based on our analysis.\n   - (C) The hawk is the leftmost: This is incorrect because the owl is the leftmost.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> B"
