    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their age, given the statements in the paragraph. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Vehicles**: We have three vehicles: a tractor, a convertible, and a minivan.\n\n2. **Statement Analysis**:\n   - The tractor is the second-newest.\n   - The minivan is newer than the convertible.\n\n3. **Determine the Order**:\n   - Since the tractor is the second-newest, it cannot be the newest or the oldest. Therefore, it must be in the middle position in terms of age.\n   - The minivan is newer than the convertible, which means the minivan cannot be the oldest. Therefore, the minivan must be the newest.\n   - Since the minivan is the newest and the tractor is the second-newest, the convertible must be the oldest.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Newest: Minivan\n   - Second-newest: Tractor\n   - Oldest: Convertible\n\n5. **Verify with Options**:\n   - (A) The tractor is the second-newest: This is consistent with our analysis.\n   - (B) The convertible is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the convertible is the oldest.\n   - (C) The minivan is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the minivan is the newest.\n\nThe correct option based on the analysis is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
