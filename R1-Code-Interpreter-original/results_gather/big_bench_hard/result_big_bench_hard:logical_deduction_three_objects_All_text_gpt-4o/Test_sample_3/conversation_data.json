    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. There are three birds: a robin, a blue jay, and a crow.\n2. The robin is to the right of the crow.\n3. The robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- From statement 2, \"The robin is to the right of the crow,\" we can infer that the crow is not the rightmost bird. Therefore, the crow must be to the left of the robin.\n\n- From statement 3, \"The robin is to the left of the blue jay,\" we can infer that the blue jay is not the leftmost bird. Therefore, the blue jay must be to the right of the robin.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can deduce the order of the birds from left to right:\n\n- The crow is the leftmost bird.\n- The robin is in the middle.\n- The blue jay is the rightmost bird.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the given options:\n\n(A) The robin is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the robin is in the middle.\n(B) The blue jay is the rightmost - This is correct because the blue jay is indeed the rightmost bird.\n(C) The crow is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the crow is the leftmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
