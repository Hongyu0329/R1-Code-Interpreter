    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. There are three books: a green book, a brown book, and an orange book.\n2. The brown book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The green book is to the left of the brown book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- According to condition 3, the green book is to the left of the brown book. This means the green book cannot be in the second or third position; it must be in the first position.\n- According to condition 2, the brown book is to the left of the orange book. This means the brown book cannot be in the third position; it must be in the second position if the green book is in the first position.\n- Consequently, the orange book must be in the third position because it is to the right of both the green and brown books.\n\nThus, the order of the books from left to right is: Green, Brown, Orange.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The green book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the green book is the first from the left.\n(B) The brown book is the second from the left - This is correct because the brown book is indeed in the second position.\n(C) The orange book is the second from the left - This is incorrect because the orange book is the third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
