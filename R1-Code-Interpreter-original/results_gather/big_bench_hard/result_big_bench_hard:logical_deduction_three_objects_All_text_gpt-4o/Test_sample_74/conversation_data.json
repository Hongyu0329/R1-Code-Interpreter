    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative ages of the three vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan, and the truck, based on the given information.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - The minivan is newer than the truck. This means the truck is older than the minivan.\n   - The station wagon is newer than the minivan. This means the minivan is older than the station wagon.\n\n2. **Establish the order of ages:**\n   - From the first statement, we know: Truck > Minivan (where \">\" means \"is older than\").\n   - From the second statement, we know: Minivan > Station Wagon.\n\n3. **Combine the relationships:**\n   - By combining the two relationships, we get: Truck > Minivan > Station Wagon.\n\n4. **Determine the oldest vehicle:**\n   - From the combined order, the truck is the oldest vehicle.\n\n5. **Match with the options:**\n   - (A) The station wagon is the oldest. (This is incorrect as the station wagon is the newest.)\n   - (B) The minivan is the oldest. (This is incorrect as the minivan is in the middle.)\n   - (C) The truck is the oldest. (This is correct as per our analysis.)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C).\n\nFinal answer: <<<C>>>"
