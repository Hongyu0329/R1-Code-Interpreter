    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions and then identify which book is second from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the order of the books:**\n   - We have three books: black, orange, and blue.\n   - The blue book is to the right of the orange book. This means the orange book cannot be the last one on the right.\n   - The orange book is to the right of the black book. This means the black book cannot be the last one on the right.\n\n2. **Determine the possible positions:**\n   - Since the orange book is to the right of the black book, the black book must be on the leftmost side.\n   - Since the blue book is to the right of the orange book, the blue book must be on the rightmost side.\n   - Therefore, the only possible order is: Black book, Orange book, Blue book.\n\n3. **Identify the second book from the left:**\n   - In the order determined (Black, Orange, Blue), the orange book is the second from the left.\n\n4. **Match with the options:**\n   - (A) The black book is the second from the left - Incorrect, as the black book is the first.\n   - (B) The orange book is the second from the left - Correct, as determined.\n   - (C) The blue book is the second from the left - Incorrect, as the blue book is the third.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
