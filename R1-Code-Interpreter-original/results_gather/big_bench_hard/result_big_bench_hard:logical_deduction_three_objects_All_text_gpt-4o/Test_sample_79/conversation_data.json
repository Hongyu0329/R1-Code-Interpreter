    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Mya finished below Ada.\"\n   - This means that Ada finished in a higher position than Mya. Therefore, Mya cannot be first, and Ada cannot be last.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"Mel finished above Ada.\"\n   - This means that Mel finished in a higher position than Ada. Therefore, Ada cannot be first, and Mel cannot be last.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- Since Mya finished below Ada, Mya cannot be first. This eliminates option (C) \"Mya finished first.\"\n- Since Mel finished above Ada, Ada cannot be first. This eliminates option (A) \"Ada finished first.\"\n\nWith options (A) and (C) eliminated, the only remaining possibility is option (B) \"Mel finished first.\"\n\nLet's verify this conclusion:\n\n- If Mel finished first, then Ada and Mya must have finished in the remaining positions.\n- Since Mya finished below Ada, Ada must have finished second, and Mya must have finished third.\n\nThis order is consistent with all the given statements:\n- Mel finished above Ada (Mel is first, Ada is second).\n- Mya finished below Ada (Mya is third, Ada is second).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Mel finished first.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
