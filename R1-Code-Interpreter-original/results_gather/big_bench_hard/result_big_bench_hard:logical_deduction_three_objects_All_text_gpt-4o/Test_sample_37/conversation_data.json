    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which bird is the rightmost.\n\n1. **Identify the birds and their positions:**\n   - We have three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon.\n\n2. **Analyze the given statements:**\n   - \"The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\"\n     - This means the falcon is positioned somewhere to the right of the blue jay.\n   - \"The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\"\n     - This means the blue jay is positioned somewhere to the right of the quail.\n\n3. **Determine the order of the birds:**\n   - From the second statement, \"The blue jay is to the right of the quail,\" we can infer that the quail is the leftmost bird.\n   - From the first statement, \"The falcon is to the right of the blue jay,\" we can infer that the falcon is the rightmost bird.\n\n4. **Arrange the birds based on the analysis:**\n   - The order from left to right is: Quail, Blue Jay, Falcon.\n\n5. **Identify the rightmost bird:**\n   - According to the arrangement, the falcon is the rightmost bird.\n\n6. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (C) states \"The falcon is the rightmost,\" which matches our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
