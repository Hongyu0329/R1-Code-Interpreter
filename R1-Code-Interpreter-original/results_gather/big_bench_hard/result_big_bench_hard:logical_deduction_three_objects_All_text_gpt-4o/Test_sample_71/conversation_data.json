    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished in the tournament based on the given statements. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the golfers**: The golfers mentioned are Joe, Eve, and Amy.\n\n2. **Analyze the given statements**:\n   - \"Amy finished above Eve\": This means Amy's position is better than Eve's position.\n   - \"Joe finished first\": This means Joe's position is the best among the three golfers.\n\n3. **Determine the implications of the statements**:\n   - Since Joe finished first, neither Amy nor Eve can be in the first position.\n   - Amy finished above Eve, so Amy cannot be in the last position.\n\n4. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - **Option (A) Joe finished last**: This contradicts the statement that Joe finished first. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n   - **Option (B) Eve finished last**: This is possible because Joe is first, and Amy is above Eve, leaving Eve in the last position.\n   - **Option (C) Amy finished last**: This contradicts the statement that Amy finished above Eve. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only option that is consistent with all the given statements is that Eve finished last.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
