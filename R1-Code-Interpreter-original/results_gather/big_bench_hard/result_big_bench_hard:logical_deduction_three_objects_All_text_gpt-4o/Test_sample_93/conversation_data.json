    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine the correct order of the birds on the branch. Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the birds and their positions:**\n   - There are three birds: a hummingbird, a blue jay, and a raven.\n   - We need to determine their positions from left to right.\n\n2. **Analyze the given statements:**\n   - \"The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\"\n     - This means the hummingbird is positioned to the left of the blue jay.\n   - \"The raven is the second from the left.\"\n     - This means the raven is in the middle position.\n\n3. **Determine the positions:**\n   - Since the raven is the second from the left, it occupies the middle position.\n   - The blue jay must be to the right of the hummingbird, so the hummingbird cannot be in the middle position.\n   - Therefore, the hummingbird must be in the first position (leftmost), and the blue jay must be in the third position (rightmost).\n\n4. **Verify the positions:**\n   - First position: Hummingbird\n   - Second position: Raven\n   - Third position: Blue Jay\n\n5. **Match the positions with the options:**\n   - Option (A): The hummingbird is the second from the left. (Incorrect, as the hummingbird is first from the left)\n   - Option (B): The blue jay is the second from the left. (Incorrect, as the blue jay is third from the left)\n   - Option (C): The raven is the second from the left. (Correct, as the raven is indeed in the middle position)\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
