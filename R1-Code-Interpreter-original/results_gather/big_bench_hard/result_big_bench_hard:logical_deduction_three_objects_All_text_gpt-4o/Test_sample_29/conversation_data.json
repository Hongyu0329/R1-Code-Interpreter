    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given statements:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: The purple book is to the right of the yellow book.\n   - This means the purple book is not the leftmost book. It is either in the middle or the rightmost position.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: The yellow book is to the right of the red book.\n   - This means the yellow book is not the leftmost book. It is either in the middle or the rightmost position.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible positions for each book:\n\n- **Red Book**: Since the yellow book is to the right of the red book, the red book must be the leftmost book.\n\n- **Yellow Book**: Since the yellow book is to the right of the red book, it must be in the middle position.\n\n- **Purple Book**: Since the purple book is to the right of the yellow book, it must be the rightmost book.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of the books from left to right is: Red Book, Yellow Book, Purple Book.\n\nTherefore, the purple book is the rightmost book.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
