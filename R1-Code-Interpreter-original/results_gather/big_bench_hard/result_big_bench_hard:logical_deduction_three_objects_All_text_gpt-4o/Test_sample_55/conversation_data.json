    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers—Amy, Eli, and Eve—finished in the tournament based on the given conditions.\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions:**\n   - Eve finished above Amy.\n   - Eli finished below Amy.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**\n   - Since Eve finished above Amy, Eve cannot be in the last position. Therefore, Eve must be either first or second.\n   - Since Eli finished below Amy, Eli cannot be in the first or second position. Therefore, Eli must be in the last position.\n\n3. **Determining the Order:**\n   - If Eli is in the last position (third), then Amy must be in the second position because Eve is above Amy.\n   - This leaves Eve to be in the first position.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The order of finish is: Eve (first), Amy (second), Eli (third).\n\n5. **Matching with Options:**\n   - Option (A) states \"Amy finished second,\" which matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Amy finished second"
