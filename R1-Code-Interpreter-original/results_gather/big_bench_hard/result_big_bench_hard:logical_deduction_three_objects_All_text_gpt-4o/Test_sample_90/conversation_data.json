    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished in the tournament based on the given information.\n\n1. **Identify the golfers and their positions:**\n   - There are three golfers: Eli, Mya, and Eve.\n   - We are given that Eli finished last.\n   - We are also given that Mya finished second.\n\n2. **Determine the positions:**\n   - Since Eli finished last, he is in the third position.\n   - Mya finished second, so she is in the second position.\n\n3. **Determine who finished first:**\n   - The only golfer left is Eve, as Eli and Mya's positions are already determined.\n   - Therefore, Eve must have finished first.\n\n4. **Match the conclusion with the options:**\n   - Option (A) states Eli finished first, which contradicts the given information that Eli finished last.\n   - Option (B) states Mya finished first, which contradicts the given information that Mya finished second.\n   - Option (C) states Eve finished first, which is consistent with our analysis.\n\nBased on the logical analysis, the correct answer is that Eve finished first.\n\n<<<C>>>"
