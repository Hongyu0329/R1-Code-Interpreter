    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given in the paragraph and compare it with the options provided. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Objects and Their Order:**\n   - We have three vehicles: a convertible, a tractor, and a hatchback.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - The hatchback is older than the convertible. This means the hatchback was made before the convertible.\n   - The tractor is the newest. This means the tractor was made after both the hatchback and the convertible.\n\n3. **Determine the Order of Age:**\n   - Since the hatchback is older than the convertible, the order of age from oldest to newest between these two is: Hatchback > Convertible.\n   - The tractor, being the newest, is newer than both the hatchback and the convertible.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - (A) The convertible is the newest: This is incorrect because the tractor is stated to be the newest.\n   - (B) The tractor is the newest: This is correct as per the information given in the paragraph.\n   - (C) The hatchback is the newest: This is incorrect because the hatchback is older than the convertible, and the tractor is the newest.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the correct answer is that the tractor is the newest.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
