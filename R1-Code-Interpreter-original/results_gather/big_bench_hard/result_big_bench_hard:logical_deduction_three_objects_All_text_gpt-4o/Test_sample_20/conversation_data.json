    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given in the paragraph and compare it with the options provided. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Fruits and Their Prices:**\n   - The fruit stand sells three types of fruits: plums, apples, and loquats.\n   - We are given two pieces of information about their prices:\n     - The loquats are the cheapest.\n     - The plums are less expensive than the apples.\n\n2. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - From the statement \"The loquats are the cheapest,\" we can infer that loquats have the lowest price among the three fruits.\n   - From the statement \"The plums are less expensive than the apples,\" we can infer that plums are cheaper than apples, but not necessarily the cheapest overall.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - **Option (A):** The plums are the cheapest.\n     - This contradicts the given information that \"The loquats are the cheapest.\" Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n   - **Option (B):** The apples are the cheapest.\n     - This also contradicts the given information that \"The loquats are the cheapest.\" Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n   - **Option (C):** The loquats are the cheapest.\n     - This is consistent with the given information. The loquats are indeed stated to be the cheapest.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the only option that aligns with the information provided in the paragraph is Option (C).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<C>>>"
