    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given in the paragraph and determine the correct order of the golfers' finishes in the tournament. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the golfers and their positions:**\n   - There are three golfers: Ana, Dan, and Mel.\n   - We are given that Dan finished second.\n   - We are also given that Mel finished first.\n\n2. **Determine Ana's position:**\n   - Since there are only three positions (first, second, and third) and we know that Mel finished first and Dan finished second, the only position left for Ana is third.\n\n3. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - Option (A) states \"Ana finished second.\" This is incorrect because Dan finished second.\n   - Option (B) states \"Dan finished second.\" This is correct as per the information given.\n   - Option (C) states \"Mel finished second.\" This is incorrect because Mel finished first.\n\n4. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the correct option is (B) Dan finished second.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
