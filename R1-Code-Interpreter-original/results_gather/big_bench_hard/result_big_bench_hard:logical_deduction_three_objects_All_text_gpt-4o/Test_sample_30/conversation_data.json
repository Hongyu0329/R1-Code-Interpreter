    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the second-most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the order of prices based on the given statements:**\n   - We have three fruits: watermelons, apples, and mangoes.\n   - Statement 1: \"The apples are less expensive than the mangoes.\"\n     - This implies: Apples < Mangoes\n   - Statement 2: \"The mangoes are less expensive than the watermelons.\"\n     - This implies: Mangoes < Watermelons\n\n2. **Combine the information:**\n   - From the two statements, we can deduce the following order of prices:\n     - Apples < Mangoes < Watermelons\n\n3. **Determine the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - In the order Apples < Mangoes < Watermelons, the second-most expensive fruit is the one that is in the middle of the sequence.\n   - Therefore, the mangoes are the second-most expensive fruit.\n\n4. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A): The watermelons are the second-most expensive. (Incorrect, as watermelons are the most expensive)\n   - Option (B): The apples are the second-most expensive. (Incorrect, as apples are the least expensive)\n   - Option (C): The mangoes are the second-most expensive. (Correct, as mangoes are in the middle of the sequence)\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
