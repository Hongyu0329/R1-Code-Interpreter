    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the second-most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - The mangoes are less expensive than the peaches.\n   - The apples are less expensive than the mangoes.\n\n2. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - Since the mangoes are less expensive than the peaches, the order between these two is: Mangoes < Peaches.\n   - Since the apples are less expensive than the mangoes, the order between these two is: Apples < Mangoes.\n\n3. **Combine the information:**\n   - From the above two points, we can deduce the complete order of prices: Apples < Mangoes < Peaches.\n\n4. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - In the order Apples < Mangoes < Peaches, the second-most expensive fruit is the one in the middle, which is Mangoes.\n\n5. **Match with the options:**\n   - (A) The apples are the second-most expensive: This is incorrect because apples are the least expensive.\n   - (B) The peaches are the second-most expensive: This is incorrect because peaches are the most expensive.\n   - (C) The mangoes are the second-most expensive: This is correct because mangoes are in the middle of the order.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
