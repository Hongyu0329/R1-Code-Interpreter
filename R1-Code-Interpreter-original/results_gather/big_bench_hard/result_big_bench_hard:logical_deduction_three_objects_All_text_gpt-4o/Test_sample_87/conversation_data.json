    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relative prices:**\n   - We have three fruits: peaches, pears, and mangoes.\n   - The statement \"The mangoes are less expensive than the pears\" tells us that mangoes are cheaper than pears.\n   - The statement \"The peaches are the cheapest\" tells us that peaches are cheaper than both mangoes and pears.\n\n2. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - Since peaches are the cheapest, they are less expensive than both mangoes and pears.\n   - Since mangoes are less expensive than pears, the order from cheapest to most expensive is: peaches, mangoes, pears.\n\n3. **Analyze the options:**\n   - Option (A) states \"The peaches are the most expensive.\" This contradicts the given information that peaches are the cheapest.\n   - Option (B) states \"The pears are the most expensive.\" This is consistent with our analysis that pears are more expensive than both mangoes and peaches.\n   - Option (C) states \"The mangoes are the most expensive.\" This contradicts the given information that mangoes are less expensive than pears.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the only option that is consistent with the given information is Option (B), where pears are the most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
