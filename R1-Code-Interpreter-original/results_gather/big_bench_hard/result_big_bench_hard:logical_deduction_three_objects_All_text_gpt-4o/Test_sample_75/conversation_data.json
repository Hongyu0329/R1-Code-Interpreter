    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions:\n\n1. There are three books: a white book, a black book, and a purple book.\n2. The black book is to the left of the purple book.\n3. The purple book is to the left of the white book.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- From condition 2, we know that the black book is positioned to the left of the purple book. This gives us the partial order: Black Book < Purple Book.\n\n- From condition 3, we know that the purple book is positioned to the left of the white book. This gives us another partial order: Purple Book < White Book.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can deduce the complete order of the books on the shelf:\n\n- Black Book < Purple Book < White Book\n\nThis means the black book is the leftmost, followed by the purple book, and the white book is the rightmost.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The white book is the leftmost - This is incorrect because the white book is the rightmost.\n\n(B) The black book is the leftmost - This is correct because the black book is indeed the leftmost.\n\n(C) The purple book is the leftmost - This is incorrect because the purple book is in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
