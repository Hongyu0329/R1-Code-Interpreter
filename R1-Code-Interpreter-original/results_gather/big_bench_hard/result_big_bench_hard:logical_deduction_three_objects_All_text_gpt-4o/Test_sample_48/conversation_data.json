    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles based on their ages. We have three vehicles: a sedan, a tractor, and a bus. The statements provided are:\n\n1. The sedan is older than the tractor.\n2. The bus is older than the sedan.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- From statement 1, \"The sedan is older than the tractor,\" we can infer that the tractor is the newest among the sedan and the tractor.\n\n- From statement 2, \"The bus is older than the sedan,\" we can infer that the bus is older than both the sedan and the tractor.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles in order of their ages from oldest to newest:\n\n- The bus is the oldest because it is older than the sedan, which is older than the tractor.\n- The sedan is older than the tractor, so it is in the middle.\n- The tractor is the newest because it is younger than both the sedan and the bus.\n\nTherefore, the order from oldest to newest is: Bus, Sedan, Tractor.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The sedan is the second-newest: This is true because the sedan is in the middle position, making it the second-newest.\n\n(B) The tractor is the second-newest: This is false because the tractor is the newest, not the second-newest.\n\n(C) The bus is the second-newest: This is false because the bus is the oldest, not the second-newest.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
