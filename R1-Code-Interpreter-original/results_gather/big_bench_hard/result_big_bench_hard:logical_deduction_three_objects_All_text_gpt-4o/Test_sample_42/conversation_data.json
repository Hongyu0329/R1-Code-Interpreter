    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the three fruits: apples, peaches, and loquats. We are provided with two key pieces of information:\n\n1. The loquats are less expensive than the apples.\n2. The peaches are more expensive than the apples.\n\nLet's break down the information step by step:\n\n- From the first statement, \"The loquats are less expensive than the apples,\" we can infer that the price of loquats is less than the price of apples. This can be represented as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Price of Loquats} < \\text{Price of Apples}\n  \\]\n\n- From the second statement, \"The peaches are more expensive than the apples,\" we can infer that the price of peaches is greater than the price of apples. This can be represented as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Price of Peaches} > \\text{Price of Apples}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\n\n(A) The apples are the most expensive.\n- This option would imply that the price of apples is greater than both the price of peaches and the price of loquats. However, this contradicts the second statement that peaches are more expensive than apples. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.\n\n(B) The peaches are the most expensive.\n- This option would imply that the price of peaches is greater than both the price of apples and the price of loquats. This is consistent with the second statement that peaches are more expensive than apples, and it does not contradict the first statement. Therefore, option (B) is possible.\n\n(C) The loquats are the most expensive.\n- This option would imply that the price of loquats is greater than both the price of apples and the price of peaches. However, this contradicts the first statement that loquats are less expensive than apples. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that is consistent with the given information is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The peaches are the most expensive"
