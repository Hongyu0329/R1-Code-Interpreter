    "To solve the problem, let's analyze the information given step by step:\n\n1. We have three golfers: Mel, Ada, and Ana.\n2. The problem states that Mel finished last.\n3. It also states that Ana finished second.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since Mel finished last, Mel cannot be in any position other than third.\n- Ana finished second, so Ana cannot be in any position other than second.\n- This leaves only one position for Ada, which is first.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Mel finished last: This is consistent with the information given in the problem.\n(B) Ada finished last: This contradicts the information because Mel finished last.\n(C) Ana finished last: This contradicts the information because Ana finished second.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is consistent with the information provided is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
