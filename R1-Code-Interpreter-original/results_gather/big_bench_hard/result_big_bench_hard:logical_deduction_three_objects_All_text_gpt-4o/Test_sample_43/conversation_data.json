    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the arrangement of the three birds: an owl, a crow, and a cardinal. We are also given three options to determine which statement is true based on the arrangement.\n\nLet's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the birds and their positions:**\n   - There are three birds: an owl, a crow, and a cardinal.\n\n2. **Given conditions:**\n   - The crow is to the left of the owl.\n   - The owl is the second from the left.\n\n3. **Analyze the positions:**\n   - Since the owl is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n   - The crow is to the left of the owl, which means the crow must be in the first position (leftmost).\n   - This leaves the cardinal to be in the third position (rightmost).\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - First position: Crow\n   - Second position: Owl\n   - Third position: Cardinal\n\n5. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) The owl is the second from the left: This is true based on our analysis.\n   - (B) The crow is the second from the left: This is false because the crow is in the first position.\n   - (C) The cardinal is the second from the left: This is false because the cardinal is in the third position.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct statement is option (A).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
