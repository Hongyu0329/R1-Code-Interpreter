    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest.\n\n1. **Identify the vehicles**: We have three vehicles: a motorcycle, a minivan, and a tractor.\n\n2. **Understand the given conditions**:\n   - The minivan is older than the tractor.\n   - The minivan is the second-newest.\n\n3. **Analyze the conditions**:\n   - Since the minivan is older than the tractor, the tractor cannot be the oldest.\n   - The minivan being the second-newest means there is one vehicle newer than the minivan and one vehicle older than the minivan.\n\n4. **Determine the order**:\n   - Since the minivan is older than the tractor, and the minivan is the second-newest, the tractor must be the newest.\n   - This leaves the motorcycle as the oldest vehicle.\n\n5. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - (A) The motorcycle is the newest: This is incorrect because the motorcycle is the oldest.\n   - (B) The minivan is the newest: This is incorrect because the minivan is the second-newest.\n   - (C) The tractor is the newest: This is correct based on our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the tractor is the newest.\n\n<<<C>>>"
