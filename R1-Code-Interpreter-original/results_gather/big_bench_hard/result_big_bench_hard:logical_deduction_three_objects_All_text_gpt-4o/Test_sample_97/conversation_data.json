    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the second-most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relative prices:**\n   - There are three fruits: cantaloupes, oranges, and watermelons.\n   - The oranges are the most expensive.\n   - The cantaloupes are more expensive than the watermelons.\n\n2. **Arrange the fruits in order of their prices:**\n   - Since oranges are the most expensive, they are at the top of the list.\n   - Cantaloupes are more expensive than watermelons, so cantaloupes come after oranges.\n   - Watermelons are the least expensive, so they come last.\n\n3. **Determine the order:**\n   - 1st: Oranges (most expensive)\n   - 2nd: Cantaloupes\n   - 3rd: Watermelons (least expensive)\n\n4. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - From the order above, cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n\n5. **Match with the options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the cantaloupes are the second-most expensive, which matches our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
