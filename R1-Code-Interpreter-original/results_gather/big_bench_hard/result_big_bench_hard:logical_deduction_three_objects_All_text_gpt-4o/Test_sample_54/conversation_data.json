    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. There are three birds: a blue jay, a cardinal, and a quail.\n2. The cardinal is to the right of the quail.\n3. The quail is to the right of the blue jay.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- The statement \"The quail is to the right of the blue jay\" implies that the blue jay is the leftmost bird. So, the order starts with the blue jay.\n- The statement \"The cardinal is to the right of the quail\" implies that the quail is to the left of the cardinal.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can deduce the order of the birds from left to right:\n\n- The blue jay is the leftmost.\n- The quail is in the middle.\n- The cardinal is the rightmost.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the given options:\n\n(A) The blue jay is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the blue jay is the leftmost.\n(B) The cardinal is the rightmost - This is correct because the cardinal is indeed the rightmost bird.\n(C) The quail is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the quail is in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
