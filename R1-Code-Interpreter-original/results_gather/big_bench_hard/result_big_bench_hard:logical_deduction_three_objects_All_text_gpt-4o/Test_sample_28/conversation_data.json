    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the positions of the three birds on the branch based on the given conditions:\n\n1. **Birds on the branch**: Hummingbird, Blue Jay, Raven.\n2. **Condition 1**: The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird.\n   - This means the hummingbird cannot be the rightmost bird.\n3. **Condition 2**: The raven is the second from the left.\n   - This means the raven is in the middle position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's analyze the possible arrangements:\n\n- **Position 1 (Leftmost)**: \n  - The raven cannot be here because it is the second from the left.\n  - The blue jay cannot be here because it is to the right of the hummingbird.\n  - Therefore, the hummingbird must be in the leftmost position.\n\n- **Position 2 (Middle)**: \n  - The raven is the second from the left, so it must be in the middle position.\n\n- **Position 3 (Rightmost)**: \n  - The only bird left is the blue jay, so it must be in the rightmost position.\n\nThus, the arrangement from left to right is: Hummingbird, Raven, Blue Jay.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The hummingbird is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the hummingbird is the leftmost.\n\n(B) The blue jay is the rightmost - This is correct because the blue jay is indeed the rightmost bird.\n\n(C) The raven is the rightmost - This is incorrect because the raven is in the middle position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
