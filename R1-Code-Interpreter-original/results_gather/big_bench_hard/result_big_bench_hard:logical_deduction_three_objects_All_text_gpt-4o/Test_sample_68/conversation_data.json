    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements:\n\n1. There are three birds: a cardinal, a hawk, and a hummingbird.\n2. The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n3. The cardinal is to the left of the hawk.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n- The statement \"The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk\" implies that the hawk is not the rightmost bird. Therefore, the hummingbird must be either in the middle or the rightmost position.\n\n- The statement \"The cardinal is to the left of the hawk\" implies that the cardinal is not the rightmost bird. Therefore, the cardinal must be either in the leftmost or the middle position.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can deduce the following possible order of the birds:\n\n- Cardinal, Hawk, Hummingbird\n\nIn this order:\n- The cardinal is to the left of the hawk.\n- The hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The cardinal is the rightmost: This is not possible because the cardinal is to the left of the hawk.\n\n(B) The hawk is the rightmost: This is not possible because the hummingbird is to the right of the hawk.\n\n(C) The hummingbird is the rightmost: This is consistent with the order we deduced (Cardinal, Hawk, Hummingbird).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the hummingbird is the rightmost.\n\n<<<C>>>"
