    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the second-most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the order of prices based on the given statements:**\n   - We have three fruits: oranges, mangoes, and plums.\n   - Statement 1: \"The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.\"\n     - This implies: Plums < Mangoes\n   - Statement 2: \"The oranges are less expensive than the plums.\"\n     - This implies: Oranges < Plums\n\n2. **Determine the complete order of prices:**\n   - From the two statements, we can deduce the following order:\n     - Oranges < Plums < Mangoes\n\n3. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - In the order Oranges < Plums < Mangoes, the second-most expensive fruit is the one that is in the middle of the order.\n   - Therefore, the plums are the second-most expensive.\n\n4. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A): The oranges are the second-most expensive. (Incorrect, as oranges are the least expensive)\n   - Option (B): The mangoes are the second-most expensive. (Incorrect, as mangoes are the most expensive)\n   - Option (C): The plums are the second-most expensive. (Correct, as plums are in the middle of the order)\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
