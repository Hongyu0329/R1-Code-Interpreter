    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the second-most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - The pears are less expensive than the plums.\n   - The kiwis are less expensive than the pears.\n\n2. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - Since the kiwis are less expensive than the pears, and the pears are less expensive than the plums, the order from least expensive to most expensive is:\n     - Kiwis < Pears < Plums\n\n3. **Identify the second-most expensive fruit:**\n   - In the order Kiwis < Pears < Plums, the second-most expensive fruit is the one that comes after the least expensive and before the most expensive.\n   - Therefore, the pears are the second-most expensive.\n\n4. **Match with the options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the pears are the second-most expensive, which matches our analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
