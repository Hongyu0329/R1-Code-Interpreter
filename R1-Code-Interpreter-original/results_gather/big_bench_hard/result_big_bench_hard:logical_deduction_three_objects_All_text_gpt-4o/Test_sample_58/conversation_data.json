    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the cheapest.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their price relationships:**\n   - We have three fruits: watermelons, apples, and mangoes.\n   - The apples are less expensive than the mangoes.\n   - The mangoes are less expensive than the watermelons.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into inequalities:**\n   - From \"The apples are less expensive than the mangoes,\" we can write: Apples < Mangoes.\n   - From \"The mangoes are less expensive than the watermelons,\" we can write: Mangoes < Watermelons.\n\n3. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - From the inequalities, we can deduce the order of prices: Apples < Mangoes < Watermelons.\n\n4. **Identify the cheapest fruit:**\n   - Since Apples < Mangoes < Watermelons, the apples are the cheapest among the three fruits.\n\n5. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the watermelons are the cheapest, which contradicts our analysis.\n   - Option (B) states that the apples are the cheapest, which matches our analysis.\n   - Option (C) states that the mangoes are the cheapest, which contradicts our analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is that the apples are the cheapest.\n\n<<<B>>>"
