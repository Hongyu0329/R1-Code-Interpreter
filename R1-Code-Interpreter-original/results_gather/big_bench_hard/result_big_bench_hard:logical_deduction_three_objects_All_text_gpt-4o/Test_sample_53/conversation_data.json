    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the order of the vehicles based on their age.\n\n1. **Identify the Vehicles:**\n   - There are three vehicles: a motorcycle, a minivan, and a tractor.\n\n2. **Understand the Statements:**\n   - The minivan is older than the tractor.\n   - The minivan is the second-newest.\n\n3. **Analyze the Statements:**\n   - Since the minivan is older than the tractor, the tractor cannot be the oldest.\n   - The minivan being the second-newest means there is one vehicle newer than it and one vehicle older than it.\n\n4. **Determine the Order:**\n   - If the minivan is the second-newest, then the tractor must be the newest because it is younger than the minivan.\n   - This leaves the motorcycle as the only vehicle that can be older than the minivan.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Options:**\n   - (A) The motorcycle is the oldest: This is consistent with the analysis.\n   - (B) The minivan is the oldest: This contradicts the statement that the minivan is the second-newest.\n   - (C) The tractor is the oldest: This contradicts the statement that the minivan is older than the tractor.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the only option that fits all the given conditions is that the motorcycle is the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
