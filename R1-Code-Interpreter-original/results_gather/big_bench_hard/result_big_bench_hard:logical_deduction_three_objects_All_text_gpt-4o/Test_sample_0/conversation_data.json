    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the three birds on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which bird is second from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the birds and their positions:**\n   - We have three birds: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon.\n   - The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\n   - The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\n2. **Determine the order of the birds:**\n   - Since the falcon is to the right of the blue jay, the blue jay cannot be the rightmost bird.\n   - Since the blue jay is to the right of the quail, the quail cannot be the rightmost bird.\n   - Therefore, the order from left to right must be: Quail, Blue Jay, Falcon.\n\n3. **Identify the bird that is second from the left:**\n   - In the order Quail, Blue Jay, Falcon, the Blue Jay is the second bird from the left.\n\n4. **Match the order with the options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the blue jay is the second from the left, which matches our determined order.\n   - Option (B) states that the quail is the second from the left, which is incorrect.\n   - Option (C) states that the falcon is the second from the left, which is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
