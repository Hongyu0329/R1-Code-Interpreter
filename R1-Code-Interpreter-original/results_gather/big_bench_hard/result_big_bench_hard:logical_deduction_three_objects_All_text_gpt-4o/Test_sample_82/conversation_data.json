    "To solve the problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers—Ada, Mel, and Mya—finished in the tournament based on the given statements.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - \"Mya finished below Ada\": This means Mya's position number is greater than Ada's position number.\n   - \"Mel finished above Ada\": This means Mel's position number is less than Ada's position number.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Possible Orders:**\n   - Since there are only three golfers, the possible positions are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.\n   - Let's denote the positions as follows: 1st = highest, 3rd = lowest.\n\n3. **Applying the Statements:**\n   - From \"Mya finished below Ada,\" we know Mya cannot be 1st or 2nd if Ada is 1st. Therefore, Mya must be 3rd if Ada is 2nd.\n   - From \"Mel finished above Ada,\" we know Mel cannot be 2nd or 3rd if Ada is 2nd. Therefore, Mel must be 1st if Ada is 2nd.\n\n4. **Determining the Order:**\n   - If Mel is 1st, Ada is 2nd, and Mya is 3rd, all conditions are satisfied:\n     - Mel finished above Ada (Mel is 1st, Ada is 2nd).\n     - Mya finished below Ada (Mya is 3rd, Ada is 2nd).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent order with the given statements is Mel in 1st, Ada in 2nd, and Mya in 3rd.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Ada finished second.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
