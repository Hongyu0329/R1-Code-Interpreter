    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine the correct order of the books on the shelf.\n\n1. **Identify the books and their positions:**\n   - We have three books: a green book, a red book, and a blue book.\n\n2. **Analyze the given statements:**\n   - \"The red book is the rightmost.\" This means the red book is at the far right end of the shelf.\n   - \"The blue book is to the right of the green book.\" This means the blue book is positioned somewhere to the right of the green book.\n\n3. **Determine the possible order:**\n   - Since the red book is the rightmost, it must be in the third position.\n   - The blue book must be to the right of the green book, so the green book cannot be in the third position.\n   - The only possible order that satisfies both conditions is:\n     - Green book in the first position\n     - Blue book in the second position\n     - Red book in the third position\n\n4. **Evaluate the options:**\n   - (A) The green book is the rightmost: This is incorrect because the red book is the rightmost.\n   - (B) The red book is the rightmost: This is correct based on the given statement.\n   - (C) The blue book is the rightmost: This is incorrect because the red book is the rightmost.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
