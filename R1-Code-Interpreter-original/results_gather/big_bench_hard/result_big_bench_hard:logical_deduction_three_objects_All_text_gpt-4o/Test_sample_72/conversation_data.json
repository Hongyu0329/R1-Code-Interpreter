    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the relationships:**\n   - The kiwis are less expensive than the loquats.\n   - The cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into inequalities:**\n   - From \"The kiwis are less expensive than the loquats,\" we can write: Kiwi < Loquat.\n   - From \"The cantaloupes are less expensive than the kiwis,\" we can write: Cantaloupe < Kiwi.\n\n3. **Determine the order of prices:**\n   - From the inequalities, we have:\n     - Cantaloupe < Kiwi < Loquat\n\n4. **Analyze the options:**\n   - (A) The kiwis are the most expensive: This is incorrect because the loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n   - (B) The loquats are the most expensive: This is correct because the loquats are more expensive than both the kiwis and the cantaloupes.\n   - (C) The cantaloupes are the most expensive: This is incorrect because the cantaloupes are the least expensive.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the loquats are the most expensive fruit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"
