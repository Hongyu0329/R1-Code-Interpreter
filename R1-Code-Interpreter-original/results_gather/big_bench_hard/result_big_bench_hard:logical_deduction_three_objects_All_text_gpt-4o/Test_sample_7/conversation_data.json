    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the golfers and their relative positions:**\n   - There are three golfers: Eve, Rob, and Mel.\n\n2. **Analyze the first statement:**\n   - \"Rob finished below Mel.\"\n   - This means Mel finished in a higher position than Rob. So, Mel is above Rob in the ranking.\n\n3. **Analyze the second statement:**\n   - \"Mel finished below Eve.\"\n   - This means Eve finished in a higher position than Mel. So, Eve is above Mel in the ranking.\n\n4. **Combine the information:**\n   - From the first statement, we know Mel is above Rob.\n   - From the second statement, we know Eve is above Mel.\n   - Therefore, the order from highest to lowest is: Eve, Mel, Rob.\n\n5. **Determine who finished first:**\n   - Since Eve is at the top of the order, Eve finished first.\n\n6. **Match the conclusion with the options:**\n   - Option (A) states \"Eve finished first,\" which matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) Eve finished first"
