    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relationships:**\n   - We have three fruits: loquats, mangoes, and apples.\n   - The mangoes are more expensive than the apples.\n   - The loquats are more expensive than the mangoes.\n\n2. **Establish the order of prices based on the given information:**\n   - Since mangoes are more expensive than apples, we can write this as: Mangoes > Apples.\n   - Since loquats are more expensive than mangoes, we can write this as: Loquats > Mangoes.\n\n3. **Combine the relationships to determine the overall order:**\n   - From the above two points, we can deduce the following order: Loquats > Mangoes > Apples.\n\n4. **Determine which fruit is the most expensive:**\n   - From the order Loquats > Mangoes > Apples, it is clear that loquats are the most expensive fruit.\n\n5. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the loquats are the most expensive.\n   - Option (B) states that the mangoes are the most expensive.\n   - Option (C) states that the apples are the most expensive.\n\n6. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Based on our analysis, option (A) is correct because it states that the loquats are the most expensive, which matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
