    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the three birds on the branch based on the given conditions and then identify which bird is second from the left.\n\nLet's analyze the given conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1**: The blue jay is to the right of the falcon.\n   - This means the falcon is not the rightmost bird. The blue jay must be either in the middle or on the far right.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n   - This means the falcon is not the leftmost bird. The hummingbird must be either in the middle or on the far left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's consider the possible arrangements:\n\n- **Arrangement 1**: Hummingbird, Falcon, Blue Jay\n  - This arrangement satisfies both conditions:\n    - The blue jay is to the right of the falcon.\n    - The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n\n- **Arrangement 2**: Hummingbird, Blue Jay, Falcon\n  - This arrangement does not satisfy the condition that the blue jay is to the right of the falcon.\n\n- **Arrangement 3**: Falcon, Hummingbird, Blue Jay\n  - This arrangement does not satisfy the condition that the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n\n- **Arrangement 4**: Falcon, Blue Jay, Hummingbird\n  - This arrangement does not satisfy the condition that the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n\n- **Arrangement 5**: Blue Jay, Hummingbird, Falcon\n  - This arrangement does not satisfy the condition that the blue jay is to the right of the falcon.\n\n- **Arrangement 6**: Blue Jay, Falcon, Hummingbird\n  - This arrangement does not satisfy the condition that the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n\nFrom the analysis, only Arrangement 1 (Hummingbird, Falcon, Blue Jay) satisfies both conditions.\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is second from the left in this arrangement:\n\n- The order is: Hummingbird, Falcon, Blue Jay\n- The bird second from the left is the Falcon.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The falcon is the second from the left.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
