    "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given information about the relative ages of the three vehicles: a station wagon, a minivan, and a truck. We will determine which vehicle is the newest based on the provided statements.\n\n1. **Identify the Vehicles and Their Relationships:**\n   - There are three vehicles: a station wagon, a minivan, and a truck.\n   - We have two pieces of information about their relative ages:\n     - The minivan is newer than the truck.\n     - The station wagon is newer than the minivan.\n\n2. **Translate the Information into Order:**\n   - From \"The minivan is newer than the truck,\" we can infer:\n     - Minivan > Truck (where \">\" means \"is newer than\").\n   - From \"The station wagon is newer than the minivan,\" we can infer:\n     - Station Wagon > Minivan.\n\n3. **Combine the Information:**\n   - We now have two relationships:\n     - Minivan > Truck\n     - Station Wagon > Minivan\n   - By combining these, we can establish a complete order:\n     - Station Wagon > Minivan > Truck\n\n4. **Determine the Newest Vehicle:**\n   - The vehicle that is newer than all others is the station wagon, as it is newer than the minivan, which in turn is newer than the truck.\n\n5. **Select the Correct Option:**\n   - Based on the order established, the station wagon is the newest vehicle.\n   - Therefore, the correct option is (A) The station wagon is the newest.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<A>>>."
