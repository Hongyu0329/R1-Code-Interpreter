    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of each bird on the branch based on the given statements and then identify which bird is second from the left.\n\n1. **Identify the order of the birds:**\n   - We have three birds: a quail, an owl, and a hummingbird.\n   - The statement \"The quail is to the left of the owl\" implies that the quail is positioned before the owl.\n   - The statement \"The owl is to the left of the hummingbird\" implies that the owl is positioned before the hummingbird.\n\n2. **Arrange the birds based on the given conditions:**\n   - From the first statement, we know: Quail < Owl\n   - From the second statement, we know: Owl < Hummingbird\n   - Combining these, the order from left to right is: Quail, Owl, Hummingbird\n\n3. **Determine which bird is second from the left:**\n   - In the order Quail, Owl, Hummingbird, the owl is positioned second from the left.\n\n4. **Match the position with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states \"The quail is the second from the left\" - This is incorrect as the quail is first.\n   - Option (B) states \"The owl is the second from the left\" - This is correct as the owl is indeed second.\n   - Option (C) states \"The hummingbird is the second from the left\" - This is incorrect as the hummingbird is third.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
