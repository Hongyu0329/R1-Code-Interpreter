    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relationships:**\n   - We have three fruits: peaches, pears, and mangoes.\n   - The mangoes are less expensive than the peaches.\n   - The mangoes are more expensive than the pears.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into inequalities:**\n   - From \"The mangoes are less expensive than the peaches,\" we can write: Mangoes < Peaches.\n   - From \"The mangoes are more expensive than the pears,\" we can write: Mangoes > Pears.\n\n3. **Determine the order of the fruits based on their prices:**\n   - Since Mangoes < Peaches, peaches are more expensive than mangoes.\n   - Since Mangoes > Pears, mangoes are more expensive than pears.\n   - Therefore, the order from least to most expensive is: Pears < Mangoes < Peaches.\n\n4. **Identify the most expensive fruit:**\n   - From the order Pears < Mangoes < Peaches, it is clear that peaches are the most expensive.\n\n5. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the peaches are the most expensive, which matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
