    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished based on the given conditions:\n\n1. **Condition 1**: Eve finished below Eli.\n   - This means Eli finished in a higher position than Eve.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: Eve finished above Mya.\n   - This means Eve finished in a higher position than Mya.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible orderings of the golfers based on these conditions:\n\n- Since Eve finished below Eli, Eli cannot be in the last position. Therefore, Eli must be either first or second.\n- Since Eve finished above Mya, Mya must be in the last position.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Eli finishes first.\n  - If Eli is first, then Eve must be second (since she is above Mya), and Mya must be third.\n  - Order: Eli, Eve, Mya\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Eli finishes second.\n  - If Eli is second, then Eve must be first (since she is above Mya), and Mya must be third.\n  - Order: Eve, Eli, Mya\n\nFrom the above scenarios, we can see that the only consistent order with the given conditions is:\n- Eli finishes first, Eve finishes second, and Mya finishes third.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Eve finished second.\n\n<<<C>>>"
