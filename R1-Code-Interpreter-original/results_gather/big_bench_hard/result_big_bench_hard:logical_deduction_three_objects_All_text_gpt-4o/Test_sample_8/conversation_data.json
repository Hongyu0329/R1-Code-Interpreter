    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine the correct order of the books on the shelf. Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Books and Their Positions:**\n   - There are three books: an orange book, a yellow book, and a blue book.\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n   - The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n   - The orange book is the second from the left.\n\n3. **Analyze the Conditions:**\n   - Since the orange book is the second from the left, it must be in the middle position.\n   - The blue book being to the right of the yellow book means the yellow book cannot be in the rightmost position.\n\n4. **Determine the Order:**\n   - Since the orange book is in the middle, the possible positions for the yellow and blue books are:\n     - Yellow book on the left, orange book in the middle, blue book on the right.\n     - This satisfies the condition that the blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The order from left to right is: Yellow book, Orange book, Blue book.\n   - Therefore, the orange book is indeed the second from the left.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
