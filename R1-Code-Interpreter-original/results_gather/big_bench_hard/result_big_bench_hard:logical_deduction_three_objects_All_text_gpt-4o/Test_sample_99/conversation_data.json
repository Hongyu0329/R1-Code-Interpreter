    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers—Ana, Mel, and Ada—finished in the tournament based on the given conditions.\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions:**\n   - Ada finished above Ana.\n   - Mel finished below Ana.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**\n   - Since Ada finished above Ana, Ada cannot be in the last position. Therefore, Ada cannot be the last.\n   - Since Mel finished below Ana, Mel must be in a position lower than Ana. Therefore, Mel cannot be above Ana.\n\n3. **Determining the Order:**\n   - Given that Ada is above Ana, Ada must be in either the first or second position.\n   - Given that Mel is below Ana, Mel must be in the last position.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only logical order that satisfies both conditions is: Ada finished first, Ana finished second, and Mel finished last.\n\n5. **Selecting the Correct Option:**\n   - Based on the analysis, Mel finished last. Therefore, the correct option is (B) Mel finished last.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<B>>>."
