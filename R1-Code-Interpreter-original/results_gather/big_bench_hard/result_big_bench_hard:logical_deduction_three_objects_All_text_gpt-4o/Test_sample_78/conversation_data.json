    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the cheapest.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relationships:**\n   - We have three fruits: apples, pears, and plums.\n   - The pears are less expensive than the plums.\n   - The pears are more expensive than the apples.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into inequalities:**\n   - From \"The pears are less expensive than the plums,\" we can write: Pears < Plums.\n   - From \"The pears are more expensive than the apples,\" we can write: Apples < Pears.\n\n3. **Combine the inequalities:**\n   - We have two inequalities: Apples < Pears and Pears < Plums.\n   - By combining these, we get: Apples < Pears < Plums.\n\n4. **Determine the cheapest fruit:**\n   - From the combined inequality Apples < Pears < Plums, it is clear that apples are the least expensive of the three fruits.\n\n5. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states \"The apples are the cheapest,\" which matches our conclusion.\n   - Option (B) states \"The pears are the cheapest,\" which contradicts our conclusion.\n   - Option (C) states \"The plums are the cheapest,\" which also contradicts our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
