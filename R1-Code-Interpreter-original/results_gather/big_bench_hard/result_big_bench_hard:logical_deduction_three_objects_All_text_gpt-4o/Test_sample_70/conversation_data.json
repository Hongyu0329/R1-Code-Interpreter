    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the arrangement of the books and determine which option correctly identifies the leftmost book.\n\n1. **Identify the Books and Their Positions:**\n   - We have three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a green book.\n   - The green book is described as the leftmost book.\n   - The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n\n2. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Since the green book is the leftmost, it must be the first book on the left.\n   - The orange book is to the left of the blue book, meaning the orange book must be positioned before the blue book when moving from left to right.\n\n3. **Determine the Order:**\n   - Given that the green book is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n   - The orange book, being to the left of the blue book, must occupy the second position.\n   - Consequently, the blue book must be in the third position.\n\n4. **Verify the Options:**\n   - Option (A) states the blue book is the leftmost, which contradicts the given information.\n   - Option (B) states the orange book is the leftmost, which also contradicts the given information.\n   - Option (C) states the green book is the leftmost, which is consistent with the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the green book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) The green book is the leftmost"
