    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the most expensive.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relationships:**\n   - We have three fruits: oranges, mangoes, and plums.\n   - The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.\n   - The oranges are less expensive than the plums.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into inequalities:**\n   - From \"The plums are less expensive than the mangoes,\" we can write: Plums < Mangoes.\n   - From \"The oranges are less expensive than the plums,\" we can write: Oranges < Plums.\n\n3. **Determine the order of the fruits based on their prices:**\n   - Since Oranges < Plums and Plums < Mangoes, we can deduce the order of prices as: Oranges < Plums < Mangoes.\n\n4. **Identify the most expensive fruit:**\n   - From the order Oranges < Plums < Mangoes, it is clear that the mangoes are the most expensive.\n\n5. **Match the conclusion with the given options:**\n   - Option (A) states that the oranges are the most expensive, which contradicts our findings.\n   - Option (B) states that the mangoes are the most expensive, which matches our conclusion.\n   - Option (C) states that the plums are the most expensive, which contradicts our findings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
