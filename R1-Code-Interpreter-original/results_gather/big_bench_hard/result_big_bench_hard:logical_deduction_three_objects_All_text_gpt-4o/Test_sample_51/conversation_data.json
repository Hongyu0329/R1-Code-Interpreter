    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements about the prices of the fruits and determine which fruit is the cheapest.\n\n1. **Identify the fruits and their relationships:**\n   - The fruits mentioned are oranges, mangoes, and plums.\n   - We have two statements about their prices:\n     - The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.\n     - The oranges are less expensive than the plums.\n\n2. **Translate the statements into inequalities:**\n   - From \"The plums are less expensive than the mangoes,\" we can write:\n     - Price of plums < Price of mangoes\n   - From \"The oranges are less expensive than the plums,\" we can write:\n     - Price of oranges < Price of plums\n\n3. **Combine the inequalities to determine the order of prices:**\n   - We have:\n     - Price of oranges < Price of plums < Price of mangoes\n\n4. **Determine the cheapest fruit:**\n   - From the combined inequality, it is clear that the oranges have the lowest price among the three fruits.\n\n5. **Select the correct option:**\n   - Option (A) states that the oranges are the cheapest, which matches our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
