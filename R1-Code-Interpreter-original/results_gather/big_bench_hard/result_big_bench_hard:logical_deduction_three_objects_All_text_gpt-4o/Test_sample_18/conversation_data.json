    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the three golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Mya finished below Ada.\"\n   - This means that Mya's position is worse than Ada's position. Therefore, Ada finished ahead of Mya.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"Mel finished above Ada.\"\n   - This means that Mel's position is better than Ada's position. Therefore, Mel finished ahead of Ada.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to determine the order:\n\n- Since Mel finished above Ada, Mel is not last.\n- Since Mya finished below Ada, Mya is not ahead of Ada.\n- Therefore, the only possible order is: Mel finished first, Ada finished second, and Mya finished last.\n\nNow, let's match this order with the given options:\n\n- **Option (A)**: Ada finished last. This is incorrect because Ada finished second.\n- **Option (B)**: Mel finished last. This is incorrect because Mel finished first.\n- **Option (C)**: Mya finished last. This is correct because Mya finished third.\n\nThus, the correct answer is that Mya finished last.\n\n<<<C>>>"
