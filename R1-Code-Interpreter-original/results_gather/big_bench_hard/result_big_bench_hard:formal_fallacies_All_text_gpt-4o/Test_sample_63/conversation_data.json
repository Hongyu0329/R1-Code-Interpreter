    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap or not being a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is sufficient for being an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- **Premise 2** can be expressed in logical terms as: \n  - If (Nick is a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap) OR (Nick is not a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap), then Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo.\n\n- **Premise 1** tells us that Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n\n- From **Premise 1**, we know that the second part of the \"OR\" condition in Premise 2 is false (Nick is not a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is false).\n\n- For the \"OR\" condition in Premise 2 to be true, at least one of the conditions must be true. Since the second condition is false, the first condition (Nick is a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap) must be true for the implication to hold.\n\n- However, the conclusion states that it is not the case that Nick is an occasional purchaser of Redken shampoo. This directly contradicts the implication from Premise 2 if the first condition is true.\n\n- Therefore, for the conclusion to be true, both conditions in the \"OR\" statement must be false, which means Nick is not a frequent consumer of Burt's Bees soap and Nick is a frequent consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n\n- Since the conclusion contradicts the implication derived from the premises, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically consistent with the premises provided.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
