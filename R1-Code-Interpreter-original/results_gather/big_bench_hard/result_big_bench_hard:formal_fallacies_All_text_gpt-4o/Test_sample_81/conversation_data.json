    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ex-fan of FC Bayern München is a follower of Rangers FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München, then they are a follower of Rangers FC.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a follower of Rangers FC is necessary for being a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, then they are a follower of Rangers FC.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is neither a member of FC Mariupol nor an expert of Stade Rennais FC is an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a member of FC Mariupol and not an expert of Stade Rennais FC, then they are an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Not being a follower of Rangers FC is sufficient for being a member of FC Mariupol or not being an expert of Stade Rennais FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: If someone is not a follower of Rangers FC, then they are a member of FC Mariupol or not an expert of Stade Rennais FC.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that being an ex-fan of FC Bayern München implies being a follower of Rangers FC.\n- From Premise 2, we know that being a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal implies being a follower of Rangers FC.\n- From Premise 3, we know that if someone is neither a member of FC Mariupol nor an expert of Stade Rennais FC, they must be either an ex-fan of FC Bayern München or a friend of Sporting Clube de Portugal, both of which imply being a follower of Rangers FC.\n\nThe conclusion states that not being a follower of Rangers FC implies being a member of FC Mariupol or not being an expert of Stade Rennais FC. This is the contrapositive of Premise 3, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
