    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every loyal buyer of Tocca soap is an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap.\n   - This means if someone is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, they must also be an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a loyal buyer of Tocca soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n   - This implies that if someone is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, they are also a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Some regular user of Lever soap is not an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap or not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n   - This means there exists at least one regular user of Lever soap who either does not purchase Bentley Organic soap occasionally or is not a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\n   - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one regular user of Lever soap who is not a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we know that a loyal buyer of Tocca soap must be both an occasional purchaser of Bentley Organic soap and a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo.\n- Premise 3 states that there is a regular user of Lever soap who fails to meet at least one of these conditions (either not purchasing Bentley Organic soap occasionally or not being a frequent consumer of L'Oreal shampoo).\n- If a regular user of Lever soap does not meet both conditions required for being a loyal buyer of Tocca soap, then they cannot be a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\n- Therefore, Premise 3 directly supports the conclusion that not every regular user of Lever soap is a loyal buyer of Tocca soap.\n\nThe argument logically follows from the premises to the conclusion, making it deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
