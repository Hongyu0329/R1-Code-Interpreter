    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a grandson of Dominic is a workmate of James.\n   - This establishes a relationship between being a grandson of Dominic and being a workmate of James. If someone is a grandson of Dominic, then they are also a workmate of James.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan is a grandson of Dominic.\n   - This premise provides a condition for being a grandson of Dominic. If someone is not a son of Cody and not a son of Ivan, then they are a grandson of Dominic.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a son of Cody or son of Ivan, is a workmate of James.\n   - The conclusion states that if someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, then they are a workmate of James.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, they are a grandson of Dominic.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a grandson of Dominic, they are a workmate of James.\n- Therefore, by combining these two premises, we can deduce that if someone is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan, they must be a workmate of James.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The premises provide a clear path from the condition of not being a son of Cody or Ivan to being a workmate of James through the intermediary step of being a grandson of Dominic.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
