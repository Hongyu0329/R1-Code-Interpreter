    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **First Premise:** \"Everyone who is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is a follower of FK Kukësi, too.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they must also be a follower of FK Kukësi. In logical terms, if D(x) represents \"x is a devotee of Legia Warszawa\" and F(x) represents \"x is a follower of FK Kukësi,\" then the premise can be expressed as: \n     - If D(x), then F(x).\n\n2. **Second Premise:** \"No follower of FK Kukësi is a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a follower of FK Kukësi, then they cannot be a friend of Olympique de Marseille. In logical terms, if F(x) represents \"x is a follower of FK Kukësi\" and M(x) represents \"x is a friend of Olympique de Marseille,\" then the premise can be expressed as:\n     - If F(x), then not M(x).\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Therefore, whoever is a devotee of Legia Warszawa is not a friend of Olympique de Marseille.\"\n   - This conclusion states that if someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa, then they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n     - If D(x), then not M(x).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we know that if someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa (D(x)), they are a follower of FK Kukësi (F(x)).\n- From the second premise, we know that if someone is a follower of FK Kukësi (F(x)), they are not a friend of Olympique de Marseille (not M(x)).\n- By combining these two premises, we can deduce that if someone is a devotee of Legia Warszawa (D(x)), they must be a follower of FK Kukësi (F(x)), and therefore, they cannot be a friend of Olympique de Marseille (not M(x)).\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
