    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"It is false that Colleen is an ancestor of Cheryle.\"\n   - This means Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Whoever is a stepsister of Esther is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\"\n   - This implies that if someone is a stepsister of Esther, then they cannot be an ancestor of Cheryle.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"It follows that it is false that Colleen is a stepsister of Esther.\"\n   - The conclusion claims that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, we know that being a stepsister of Esther implies not being an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- Premise 1 states that Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- The conclusion claims that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther.\n\n**Logical Structure**:\n- Premise 2 can be rewritten as: If someone is a stepsister of Esther, then they are not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- Premise 1 states that Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle.\n- The conclusion is that Colleen is not a stepsister of Esther.\n\n**Validity Check**:\n- The argument assumes that if Colleen is not an ancestor of Cheryle, then she cannot be a stepsister of Esther. However, Premise 2 only states that being a stepsister of Esther implies not being an ancestor of Cheryle, not the reverse.\n- The argument is attempting to use the contrapositive logic incorrectly. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" However, the argument is incorrectly assuming \"If not B, then not A\" from \"If A, then B.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is not deductively valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
