Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every supporter of Tottenham Hotspur is not an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and not a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n   - This means if someone supports Tottenham, they cannot be both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every backer of US Sassuolo Calcio who is an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n   - This means if someone is both a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio and an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ, they must either support Tottenham or be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio is a devotee of FC Zenit.\n   - This implies that if someone is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they must be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that supporters of Tottenham cannot be both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, they must be either a supporter of Tottenham or a devotee of FC Zenit.\n- The conclusion states that anyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio must be a devotee of FC Zenit.\n\n**Checking Validity**:\n- The conclusion is making a universal claim about everyone who is not both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio.\n- However, the premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that everyone who does not meet both conditions (being an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio) is necessarily a devotee of FC Zenit.\n- The premises only specify conditions for those who are both an expert of Trabzonspor AŞ and a backer of US Sassuolo Calcio, not for those who are not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
