    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and the relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Identify the premises and conclusion:**\n   - Premise 1: It is not the case that Homer is a classmate of Frank.\n   - Premise 2: Being a classmate of Edward is necessary for being a classmate of Frank.\n   - Conclusion: It is not the case that Homer is a classmate of Edward.\n\n2. **Analyze the logical structure:**\n   - Premise 2 states a necessary condition: If someone is a classmate of Frank, then they must be a classmate of Edward. This can be expressed as: If \\( C_F \\) (classmate of Frank), then \\( C_E \\) (classmate of Edward).\n   - Premise 1 states that Homer is not a classmate of Frank: \\(\\neg C_F\\).\n\n3. **Apply logical reasoning:**\n   - From Premise 2, we know: \\( C_F \\rightarrow C_E \\).\n   - From Premise 1, we have: \\(\\neg C_F\\).\n   - Using the contrapositive reasoning, if \\( C_F \\rightarrow C_E \\), then \\(\\neg C_E \\rightarrow \\neg C_F\\).\n   - Since we have \\(\\neg C_F\\), we cannot directly conclude \\(\\neg C_E\\) from the given premises. The premises do not provide enough information to deduce that Homer is not a classmate of Edward.\n\n4. **Determine validity:**\n   - The argument attempts to conclude \\(\\neg C_E\\) (Homer is not a classmate of Edward) from \\(\\neg C_F\\) (Homer is not a classmate of Frank) and the necessary condition \\( C_F \\rightarrow C_E \\).\n   - However, the conclusion \\(\\neg C_E\\) does not logically follow from the premises because the premises do not establish a direct link from \\(\\neg C_F\\) to \\(\\neg C_E\\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nFinal answer: <<<invalid>>>"
