    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo is necessary for being a regular consumer of Yardley London soap.\n   - This means that if someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, they must also be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo. In logical terms, if Y (regular consumer of Yardley London soap), then K (frequent consumer of KMS shampoo).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is a regular user of Joico shampoo is not a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo.\n   - This means that if someone is a regular user of Joico shampoo, they cannot be a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo. In logical terms, if J (regular user of Joico shampoo), then not K (not a frequent consumer of KMS shampoo).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: No regular consumer of Yardley London soap is a regular user of Joico shampoo.\n   - This means that if someone is a regular consumer of Yardley London soap, they cannot be a regular user of Joico shampoo. In logical terms, if Y, then not J.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: If Y, then K.\n- From Premise 2, we have: If J, then not K.\n\nTo prove the conclusion (If Y, then not J), we can use the premises:\n\n- Assume Y (regular consumer of Yardley London soap).\n- From Premise 1, if Y, then K (frequent consumer of KMS shampoo).\n- From Premise 2, if J, then not K.\n- If K is true (from Y), then not K must be false, which means J cannot be true.\n- Therefore, if Y, then not J.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
