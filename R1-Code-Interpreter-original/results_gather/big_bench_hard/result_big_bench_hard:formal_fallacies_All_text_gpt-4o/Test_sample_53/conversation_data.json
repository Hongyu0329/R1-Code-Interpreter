  "question": "\"Is Siri a stepsister of Mary? Is Susan related to Kate? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, no great-grandmother of Doreen is a half-sister of Kathy. Moreover, every great-grandmother of Doreen is a workmate of Inocencia or an ancestor of Wanda or a half-sister of Kathy. Finally, being a great-grandmother of Doreen is sufficient for not being a workmate of Inocencia. So, necessarily, every great-grandmother of Doreen is an ancestor of Wanda.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premises:**\n   - No great-grandmother of Doreen is a half-sister of Kathy.\n   - Every great-grandmother of Doreen is a workmate of Inocencia or an ancestor of Wanda or a half-sister of Kathy.\n   - Being a great-grandmother of Doreen is sufficient for not being a workmate of Inocencia.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - Every great-grandmother of Doreen is an ancestor of Wanda.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - From the first premise, we know that no great-grandmother of Doreen can be a half-sister of Kathy.\n   - The second premise provides three possibilities for every great-grandmother of Doreen: being a workmate of Inocencia, being an ancestor of Wanda, or being a half-sister of Kathy.\n   - The third premise states that if someone is a great-grandmother of Doreen, they cannot be a workmate of Inocencia.\n\n4. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - Since no great-grandmother of Doreen can be a half-sister of Kathy (from the first premise), we can eliminate the possibility of any great-grandmother being a half-sister of Kathy.\n   - Since being a great-grandmother of Doreen means they cannot be a workmate of Inocencia (from the third premise), we can eliminate the possibility of any great-grandmother being a workmate of Inocencia.\n   - Therefore, the only remaining possibility for every great-grandmother of Doreen is to be an ancestor of Wanda.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The argument logically follows from the premises. Since all other possibilities are eliminated, every great-grandmother of Doreen must be an ancestor of Wanda.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
