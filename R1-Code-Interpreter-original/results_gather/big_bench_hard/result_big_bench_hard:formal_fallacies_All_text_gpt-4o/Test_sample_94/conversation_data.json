The following argument pertains to this question: First of all, every rare consumer of KMS shampoo who is an owner of a Aveeno shampoo is a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap or a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo. Next, no rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of a Aveeno shampoo.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every rare consumer of KMS shampoo who is an owner of Aveeno shampoo is a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap or a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\n   - Let's denote:\n     - \\( A \\): Rare consumer of KMS shampoo.\n     - \\( B \\): Owner of Aveeno shampoo.\n     - \\( C \\): Rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap.\n     - \\( D \\): Regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\n   - The premise can be expressed as: If \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), then \\( C \\) or \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: No rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap is both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of Aveeno shampoo.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If \\( C \\), then not both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every rare consumer of KMS shampoo who is an owner of Aveeno shampoo is also a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), then \\( D \\).\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of Aveeno shampoo (\\( A \\) and \\( B \\)), then they must be either a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap (\\( C \\)) or a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo (\\( D \\)).\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap (\\( C \\)), they cannot be both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of Aveeno shampoo (\\( A \\) and \\( B \\)). This implies that if \\( C \\) is true, then either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be false.\n\n- Combining these two premises, if someone is both a rare consumer of KMS shampoo and an owner of Aveeno shampoo (\\( A \\) and \\( B \\)), they cannot be a rare consumer of Colgate-Palmolive soap (\\( C \\)) because that would contradict Premise 2. Therefore, the only option left from Premise 1 is that they must be a regular user of Sunsilk shampoo (\\( D \\)).\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
