    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **First Premise**: \"Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a brother of Edward, then they must be a nephew of Henry. In logical terms, Brother of Edward → Nephew of Henry.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: \"Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.\"\n   - This states that there exists at least one person who is both an ancestor of Carlos and a nephew of Henry, and this person is also a workmate of Efrain.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: \"Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a brother of Edward, then they are a workmate of Efrain. In logical terms, Brother of Edward → Workmate of Efrain.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \"Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.\"\n   - The argument concludes that there is someone who is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From the third premise, we know that if someone is a brother of Edward, they are a workmate of Efrain.\n- The second premise tells us that there is an ancestor of Carlos who is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.\n- The first premise tells us that being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.\n- To satisfy the conclusion, we need to show that there is an ancestor of Carlos who is a brother of Edward.\n\n**Logical Steps**:\n- From the second premise, we have an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.\n- From the third premise, if someone is a brother of Edward, they are a workmate of Efrain.\n- The first premise states that to be a brother of Edward, one must be a nephew of Henry.\n- The second premise already provides us with an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.\n- Therefore, this ancestor of Carlos could potentially be a brother of Edward, satisfying all conditions.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The argument is structured such that the premises logically lead to the conclusion. The conditions for being a brother of Edward (nephew of Henry and workmate of Efrain) are met by the ancestor of Carlos mentioned in the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
