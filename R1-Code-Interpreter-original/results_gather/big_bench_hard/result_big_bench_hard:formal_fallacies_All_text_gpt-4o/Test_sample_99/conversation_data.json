    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is a frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap or a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n   - Let's denote:\n     - P: Rare consumer of Pantene shampoo\n     - H: Occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo\n     - T: Frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap\n     - M: Regular user of Mysore soap\n\n   - The premise can be expressed as: If P and H, then T or M.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every frequent consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is neither a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If T, then not P and not H.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is not both a rare consumer of Pantene shampoo and an occasional purchaser of Herbal Essences shampoo is however a regular user of Mysore soap.\n\n   - This can be expressed as: If not (P and H), then M.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is both P and H, then they must be either T or M.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is T, then they cannot be P and cannot be H. This means that if someone is T, they cannot satisfy the condition of being both P and H.\n- Therefore, if someone is both P and H, they cannot be T (because T implies not P and not H), so they must be M to satisfy Premise 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not both P and H, then they must be M.\n- However, the premises only tell us about the situation when someone is both P and H, not when they are not both P and H.\n- The premises do not provide information about what happens when someone is not both P and H, so we cannot deduce the conclusion from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
