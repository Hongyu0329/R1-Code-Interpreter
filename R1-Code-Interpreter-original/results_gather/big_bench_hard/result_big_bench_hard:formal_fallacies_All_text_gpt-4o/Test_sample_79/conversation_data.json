    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **First Premise**: \"Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo.\"\n   - This tells us about Oliver's consumption behavior regarding Organix Hair shampoo. Specifically, Oliver does not regularly use this product.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: \"Everyone who is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap is however a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\"\n   - This premise establishes a condition: If a person is not both a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Purpose soap, then they are a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - The condition can be broken down as follows:\n     - If a person is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo, or they are not a rare consumer of Purpose soap, then they are a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"We may conclude that Oliver is a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\"\n   - The conclusion is that Oliver is a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From the first premise, we know that Oliver is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo.\n- According to the second premise, if someone is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo, they do not need to be a rare consumer of Purpose soap to be a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- Therefore, based on the second premise, Oliver fits the condition of being a loyal buyer of Kiss My Face soap because he is not a regular user of Organix Hair shampoo.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
