    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **First Premise**: \"Terry is a grandson of Ward.\"\n   - This premise establishes a relationship between Terry and Ward, indicating that Terry is a descendant of Ward.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: \"Every grandson of Paul is an uncle of Earl and a grandson of Ward.\"\n   - This premise provides a condition that if someone is a grandson of Paul, then they must also be an uncle of Earl and a grandson of Ward.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"We may conclude that Terry is a grandson of Paul.\"\n   - The conclusion suggests that Terry is a grandson of Paul based on the given premises.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we know Terry is a grandson of Ward.\n- The second premise states that every grandson of Paul is also a grandson of Ward. However, it does not state that every grandson of Ward is a grandson of Paul. This is a crucial distinction.\n- The second premise also states that every grandson of Paul is an uncle of Earl. However, there is no information provided about Terry being an uncle of Earl.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises:\n\n- The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that Terry is a grandson of Paul. The fact that Terry is a grandson of Ward does not imply he is a grandson of Paul, as there could be other grandsons of Ward who are not grandsons of Paul.\n- The argument assumes a reverse implication that is not supported by the premises: being a grandson of Ward does not necessarily mean being a grandson of Paul.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
