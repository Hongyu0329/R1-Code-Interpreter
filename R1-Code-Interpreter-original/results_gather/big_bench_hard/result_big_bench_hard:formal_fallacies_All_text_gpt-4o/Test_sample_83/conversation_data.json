    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap.\n   - This is a straightforward statement about Jonathan's consumption habits.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an owner of a Lever soap or not being a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n   - This is a conditional statement. It can be broken down into:\n     - If Jonathan owns a Lever soap or Jonathan is not a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap, then Jonathan is a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n   - This is the statement we need to evaluate based on the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap.\n- From Premise 2, we have a conditional statement: \n  - If (Jonathan owns a Lever soap OR Jonathan is not a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap), then Jonathan is a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n- Since Jonathan is a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap (Premise 1), the part \"Jonathan is not a regular consumer of Eucalyptus soap\" is false.\n- For the conditional statement in Premise 2 to be true, the other part \"Jonathan owns a Lever soap\" must be false, otherwise, Jonathan would be a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo, contradicting the conclusion.\n- Therefore, the only way for the conclusion \"Jonathan is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo\" to hold true is if Jonathan does not own a Lever soap.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The argument assumes that Jonathan does not own a Lever soap to conclude that he is not a frequent consumer of Herbal Essences shampoo.\n- However, the premises do not provide any information about whether Jonathan owns a Lever soap or not.\n- Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
