    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Nobody is neither an ancestor of Alvin nor a workmate of Tony.\"\n   - This is a double negative, which simplifies to: \"Everyone is either an ancestor of Alvin or a workmate of Tony.\"\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Whoever is a schoolmate of Keith is not an ancestor of Alvin.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they cannot be an ancestor of Alvin.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Everyone who is a schoolmate of Keith is a workmate of Tony, too.\"\n   - The conclusion states that if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they must also be a workmate of Tony.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that schoolmates of Keith cannot be ancestors of Alvin.\n- From Premise 1, we know that everyone must be either an ancestor of Alvin or a workmate of Tony.\n- Therefore, if someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they cannot be an ancestor of Alvin (from Premise 2), and thus, by necessity, they must be a workmate of Tony (from Premise 1).\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. If someone is a schoolmate of Keith, they cannot be an ancestor of Alvin, and since everyone must be either an ancestor of Alvin or a workmate of Tony, they must be a workmate of Tony.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
