    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - Premise 1: \"Whoever is a schoolmate of Sondra is not a stepsister of Pricilla.\"\n     - This can be understood as: If someone is a schoolmate of Sondra, then they cannot be a stepsister of Pricilla.\n     - In logical terms, this is: If A (schoolmate of Sondra), then not B (not a stepsister of Pricilla).\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - Conclusion: \"Whoever is not a stepsister of Pricilla is a schoolmate of Sondra.\"\n     - This can be understood as: If someone is not a stepsister of Pricilla, then they are a schoolmate of Sondra.\n     - In logical terms, this is: If not B (not a stepsister of Pricilla), then A (schoolmate of Sondra).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Argument:**\n   - The argument is attempting to establish a logical equivalence between being a schoolmate of Sondra and not being a stepsister of Pricilla.\n   - The premise provides a one-way implication: If A, then not B.\n   - The conclusion attempts to reverse this implication: If not B, then A.\n\n4. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - The premise \"If A, then not B\" does not logically imply \"If not B, then A.\"\n   - The conclusion is attempting to assert the converse of the premise, which is not a valid logical inference.\n   - The valid inference from \"If A, then not B\" would be \"If B, then not A\" (the contrapositive), not \"If not B, then A.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the conclusion is not a valid logical inference from the given premise, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
