The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, it is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo. Second, everything that is an ingredient of Chickadee is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo, too. So, necessarily, it is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Chickadee.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"It is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\"\n   - This means Coffee bean extract is not found in Go 365 Shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Everything that is an ingredient of Chickadee is an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo, too.\"\n   - This implies that if something is an ingredient of Chickadee, it must also be an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"So, necessarily, it is not the case that Coffee bean extract is an ingredient of Chickadee.\"\n   - The argument concludes that Coffee bean extract is not an ingredient of Chickadee.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, if Coffee bean extract were an ingredient of Chickadee, it would also have to be an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n- However, Premise 1 states that Coffee bean extract is not an ingredient of Go 365 Shampoo.\n- Therefore, it logically follows that Coffee bean extract cannot be an ingredient of Chickadee, because if it were, it would contradict Premise 1.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
