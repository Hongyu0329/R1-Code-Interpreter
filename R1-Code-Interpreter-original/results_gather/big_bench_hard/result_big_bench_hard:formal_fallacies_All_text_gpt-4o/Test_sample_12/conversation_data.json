    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is an ingredient of Eye Restore or an ingredient of 03 Bronzing Powder.\n   - This means that if something is an ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13, it must be found in either Eye Restore or 03 Bronzing Powder.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: No ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is an ingredient of 03 Bronzing Powder.\n   - This means that if something is an ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13, it cannot be found in 03 Bronzing Powder.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is sufficient for being an ingredient of Eye Restore.\n   - This conclusion suggests that if something is an ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13, it must be an ingredient of Eye Restore.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that every ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 must be in either Eye Restore or 03 Bronzing Powder.\n- From Premise 2, we know that no ingredient of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 can be in 03 Bronzing Powder.\n- Therefore, the only option left for the ingredients of SILKY EYE PENCIL 13 is to be in Eye Restore.\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion logically follows. If an ingredient cannot be in 03 Bronzing Powder, it must be in Eye Restore, as per the premises. Thus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<valid>>>."
