Third premise: No regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap is a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap. Therefore, whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Being a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap is necessary for being a regular user of Nag Champa soap.\n   - This implies that if someone is a regular user of Nag Champa soap, they must also be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap. In logical terms, if N (Nag Champa) is true, then K (Kiss My Face) must also be true.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is at least one of these: a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap, a regular user of Nag Champa soap, or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n   - This means that if someone is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo, then at least one of the following must be true: M (Mrs. Meyer's), N (Nag Champa), or R (René Furterer).\n\n3. **Third Premise**: No regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap is a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n   - This implies that if someone is a regular consumer of Mrs. Meyer's soap (M), they cannot be a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap (K).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Whoever is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo is not a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap or a regular user of René Furterer shampoo.\n   - This conclusion states that if someone is a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo, then they are neither a regular consumer of Kiss My Face soap (K) nor a regular user of René Furterer shampoo (R).\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From the second premise, a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo must be at least one of M, N, or R.\n- If they are M, then from the third premise, they cannot be K.\n- If they are N, then from the first premise, they must be K, which contradicts the conclusion.\n- If they are R, the conclusion directly states they cannot be R.\n\nThe conclusion states that a rare consumer of John Frieda shampoo cannot be K or R. However, the premises allow for the possibility of being N, which necessitates being K, contradicting the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not deductively valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
