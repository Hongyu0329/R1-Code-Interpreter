    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC.\"\n   - This is a straightforward statement about Jose's admiration for a specific football club.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Every admirer of AEK Athens FC is an expert of Feyenoord.\"\n   - This is a universal statement that applies to all admirers of AEK Athens FC, stating that they are also experts of Feyenoord.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Jose is an expert of Feyenoord.\"\n   - This is the conclusion that the argument is trying to establish based on the given premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC.\n- Premise 2 states that if someone is an admirer of AEK Athens FC, then they are also an expert of Feyenoord.\n- Since Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC (from Premise 1), we can apply Premise 2 to conclude that Jose must also be an expert of Feyenoord.\n\n**Logical Structure**:\n- The argument follows a classic form of logical reasoning known as \"modus ponens,\" which can be summarized as:\n  - If P, then Q.\n  - P is true.\n  - Therefore, Q is true.\n\nIn this case:\n- P: Jose is an admirer of AEK Athens FC.\n- Q: Jose is an expert of Feyenoord.\n\nSince both premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from these premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
