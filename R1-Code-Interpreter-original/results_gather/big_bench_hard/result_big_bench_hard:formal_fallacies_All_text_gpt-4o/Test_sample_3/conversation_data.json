    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: No devotee of FK Partizan is an expert of Southampton FC.\n   - This means if someone is a devotee of FK Partizan, they cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: No critic of FC Spartak Moskva is an expert of Southampton FC.\n   - This means if someone is a critic of FC Spartak Moskva, they cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: To be a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan is necessary for being an admirer of Qarabağ FK.\n   - This means if someone is an admirer of Qarabağ FK, they must be either a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan (or both).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: No admirer of Qarabağ FK is an expert of Southampton FC.\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 3, if someone is an admirer of Qarabağ FK, they must be either a critic of FC Spartak Moskva or a devotee of FK Partizan.\n- From Premise 1, if they are a devotee of FK Partizan, they cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n- From Premise 2, if they are a critic of FC Spartak Moskva, they cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n- Therefore, in both cases (whether they are a devotee of FK Partizan or a critic of FC Spartak Moskva), they cannot be an expert of Southampton FC.\n\nSince the conclusion that no admirer of Qarabağ FK is an expert of Southampton FC logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
