    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: William is a devotee of AC Milan.\n   - This is a straightforward statement about William's current support.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every devotee of AC Milan and every expert of Yeni Malatyaspor is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n   - This premise establishes a condition that links being a devotee of AC Milan (or an expert of Yeni Malatyaspor) to being an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: William is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n   - The conclusion is that William, based on the premises, is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that William is a devotee of AC Milan.\n- Premise 2 states that every devotee of AC Milan is an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n- Since William is a devotee of AC Milan, according to Premise 2, he must be an ex-supporter of Fenerbahçe SK.\n\nThe argument follows a logical structure where the premises, if true, necessarily lead to the conclusion. The conclusion is directly supported by the premises without any additional assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nFinal answer: <<<valid>>>"
