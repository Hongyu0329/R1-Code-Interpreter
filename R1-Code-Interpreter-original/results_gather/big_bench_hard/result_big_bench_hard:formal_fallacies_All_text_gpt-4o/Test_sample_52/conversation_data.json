    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premise:**\n   - The first premise states: \"Whoever is an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo is not a regular user of Ivory soap.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: If a person is an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo, then they are not a regular user of Ivory soap.\n   - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If P (occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo), then not Q (not a regular user of Ivory soap).\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion states: \"Being a regular user of Ivory soap is sufficient for not being an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: If a person is a regular user of Ivory soap, then they are not an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo.\n   - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If Q (regular user of Ivory soap), then not P (not an occasional purchaser of Suave shampoo).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise is structured as: If P, then not Q.\n   - The conclusion is structured as: If Q, then not P.\n   - The conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. **Determining Validity:**\n   - Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent to their original statements, the argument is deductively valid.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
