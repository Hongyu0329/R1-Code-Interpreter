    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Whoever is a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap is not a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\"\n   - This means if someone is a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap, they cannot be a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Whoever is an owner of a Lush soap and an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is not a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap.\"\n   - This means if someone owns a Lush soap and is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap, they cannot be a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Every owner of a Lush soap who is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is also a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\"\n   - This conclusion suggests that if someone owns a Lush soap and is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap, they must be a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, we know that an owner of a Lush soap who is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is not a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is not a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap, it does not necessarily mean they are a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap. Premise 1 only states that being a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap excludes being a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap, but it does not establish a direct relationship between not being a loyal buyer of Bentley Organic soap and being a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The conclusion that every owner of a Lush soap who is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is also a regular user of Paul Mitchell soap does not logically follow from the premises. The premises do not provide sufficient information to deduce this conclusion. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
