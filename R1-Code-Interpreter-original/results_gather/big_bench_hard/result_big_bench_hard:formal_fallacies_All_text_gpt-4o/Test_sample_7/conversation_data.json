    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Peach Paint is sufficient for being an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n   - This means if something is an ingredient of Peach Paint, it must also be an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER is an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde or an ingredient of Calming Shampoo.\n   - This means if something is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, it must be an ingredient of either Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every ingredient of Peach Paint is an ingredient of Calming Shampoo or an ingredient of Brow Filler Blonde.\n   - This is what we need to determine as valid or invalid based on the premises.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, then X is also an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, then X is an ingredient of either Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo.\n- Therefore, if X is an ingredient of Peach Paint, by Premise 1, X is an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, and by Premise 2, X must be an ingredient of either Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo.\n\nThe conclusion directly follows from the premises. If every ingredient of Peach Paint is also an ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER, and every ingredient of AUTOGRAPH EYELINER is an ingredient of either Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo, then it logically follows that every ingredient of Peach Paint must be an ingredient of either Brow Filler Blonde or Calming Shampoo.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
