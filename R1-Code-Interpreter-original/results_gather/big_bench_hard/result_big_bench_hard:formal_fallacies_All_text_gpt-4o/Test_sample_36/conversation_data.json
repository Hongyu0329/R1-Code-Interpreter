    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Whoever is not a rare consumer of Lever soap is an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If a person is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, then they are an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: There exists an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who is not an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap or not an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n   - This means that at least one person who uses TRESemmé shampoo infrequently does not buy Paul Mitchell soap occasionally or does not buy Zest soap occasionally.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Some rare consumer of Lever soap is not both an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap and an occasional purchaser of Zest soap.\n   - This suggests that there is at least one person who is a rare consumer of Lever soap and does not buy both Paul Mitchell soap and Zest soap occasionally.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is not a rare consumer of Lever soap, they must be an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo.\n- Premise 2 tells us that there is at least one infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who does not buy either Paul Mitchell soap or Zest soap occasionally.\n- The conclusion states that some rare consumer of Lever soap does not buy both Paul Mitchell soap and Zest soap occasionally.\n\n**Logical Deduction**:\n- If someone is a rare consumer of Lever soap, Premise 1 does not apply to them directly because it only applies to those who are not rare consumers.\n- Premise 2 provides a specific case of an infrequent user of TRESemmé shampoo who does not buy either Paul Mitchell or Zest soap occasionally. However, it does not directly link to rare consumers of Lever soap.\n- The conclusion requires that a rare consumer of Lever soap does not buy both Paul Mitchell and Zest soap occasionally, but the premises do not provide a direct logical path to this conclusion.\n\nSince the premises do not logically lead to the conclusion, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
