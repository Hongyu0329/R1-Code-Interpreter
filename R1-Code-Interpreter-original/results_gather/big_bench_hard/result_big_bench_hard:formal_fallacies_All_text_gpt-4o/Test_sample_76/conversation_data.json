    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **First Premise:**\n   - \"Whoever is not a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo is not a rare consumer of South of France soap or not a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is not a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo, then they are either not a rare consumer of South of France soap or not a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap (or both).\n\n2. **Second Premise:**\n   - \"Being a rare consumer of South of France soap is necessary for not being a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap.\"\n   - This means: If someone is not a rare consumer of South of France soap, then they are a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap.\n\n3. **Third Premise:**\n   - \"Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap nor a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\"\n   - This implies: Everyone is either a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap or a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap (or both).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - \"Whoever is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap is a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap, then they must be a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From the third premise, we know that everyone is either a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap or a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- If someone is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap, according to the third premise, they must be a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- According to the first premise, if someone is not a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo, they must be either not a rare consumer of South of France soap or not a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap.\n- If they are a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap (from the third premise), then they cannot be not a rare consumer of Kiss My Face soap, which means they must be a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo to satisfy the first premise.\n- Therefore, if someone is not a frequent consumer of Proactiv soap, they must be a regular consumer of Pantene shampoo, which aligns with the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is structured such that the premises logically lead to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
