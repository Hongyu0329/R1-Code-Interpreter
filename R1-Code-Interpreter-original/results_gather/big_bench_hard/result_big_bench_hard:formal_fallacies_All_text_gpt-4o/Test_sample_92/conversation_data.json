    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the First Premise:**\n   - \"Nobody is neither an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap nor an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\"\n   - This is a double negative statement. It means that everyone is either an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap or an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap, or both.\n\n2. **Understanding the Second Premise:**\n   - \"No owner of an Aveeno shampoo who is an infrequent user of Zest soap is an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\"\n   - This means that if someone owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap, they cannot be an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap.\n\n3. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - \"Whoever is an owner of an Aveeno shampoo and an infrequent user of Zest soap is also an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\"\n   - The conclusion is that if someone owns Aveeno shampoo and is an infrequent user of Zest soap, they must be an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Argument:**\n   - From the first premise, we know that everyone must be an occasional purchaser of either Yardley London soap or Paul Mitchell soap.\n   - From the second premise, we know that owners of Aveeno shampoo who are infrequent users of Zest soap cannot be occasional purchasers of Paul Mitchell soap.\n   - Therefore, the only option left for these individuals, according to the premises, is to be occasional purchasers of Yardley London soap.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion logically follows from the premises. If someone cannot be an occasional purchaser of Paul Mitchell soap (due to the second premise) and must be an occasional purchaser of either Yardley London soap or Paul Mitchell soap (due to the first premise), then they must be an occasional purchaser of Yardley London soap.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
