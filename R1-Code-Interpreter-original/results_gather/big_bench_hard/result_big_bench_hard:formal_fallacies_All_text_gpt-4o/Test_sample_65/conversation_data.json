    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **First Premise**: \"It is not the case that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Nobility.\"\n   - This means Propylene oxide is not found in the product Nobility.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: \"It is false that Propylene oxide is an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core.\"\n   - This means Propylene oxide is not found in the product Cover Pink, Core.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: \"Every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is neither an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core nor an ingredient of Nobility.\"\n   - This means that if something is an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry, it cannot be an ingredient of either Cover Pink, Core or Nobility.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \"It follows that propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry.\"\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From the first and second premises, we know that Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of either Nobility or Cover Pink, Core.\n- The third premise states that any ingredient of Charged Up Cherry cannot be an ingredient of either Cover Pink, Core or Nobility.\n- Since Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core or Nobility, the third premise does not directly exclude Propylene oxide from being an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry.\n- The premises do not provide information that directly links Propylene oxide to Charged Up Cherry, nor do they exclude it based on the given conditions.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The argument does not logically exclude Propylene oxide from being an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry based on the premises provided. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
