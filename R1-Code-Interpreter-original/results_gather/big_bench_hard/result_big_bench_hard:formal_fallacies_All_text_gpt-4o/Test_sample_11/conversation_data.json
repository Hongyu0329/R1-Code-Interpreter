    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap is necessary for being an owner of a Lever soap.\"\n   - This can be translated into a logical statement: If someone is an owner of a Lever soap, then they must be a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\text{Owner of Lever soap} \\rightarrow \\text{Rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap} \\).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Being an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is sufficient for being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\"\n   - This can be translated into a logical statement: If someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, then they are a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\text{Infrequent user of American Crew shampoo} \\rightarrow \\text{Rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap} \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Every infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is an owner of a Lever soap.\"\n   - This can be translated into a logical statement: If someone is an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo, then they are an owner of a Lever soap.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\text{Infrequent user of American Crew shampoo} \\rightarrow \\text{Owner of Lever soap} \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we have: \\( \\text{Infrequent user of American Crew shampoo} \\rightarrow \\text{Rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap} \\).\n- From Premise 1, we have: \\( \\text{Owner of Lever soap} \\rightarrow \\text{Rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap} \\).\n\nTo reach the conclusion \\( \\text{Infrequent user of American Crew shampoo} \\rightarrow \\text{Owner of Lever soap} \\), we would need a logical connection that allows us to deduce the ownership of Lever soap from being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap. However, the premises do not provide this connection. Instead, they establish that being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap is necessary for owning Lever soap, not that it leads to owning Lever soap.\n\nTherefore, the argument does not logically follow from the premises, as there is no direct or indirect logical path from the premises to the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
