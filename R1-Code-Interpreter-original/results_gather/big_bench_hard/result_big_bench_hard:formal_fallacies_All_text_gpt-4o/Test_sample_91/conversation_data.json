    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **First Premise**: Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n   - This means Oliver either supports FC Vaduz or is neutral towards them.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Oliver is not a supporter of FC Viitorul.\n   - This clearly states that Oliver does not support FC Viitorul.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Every supporter of SK Rapid Wien is neither a supporter of FC Viitorul nor an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n   - This means if someone supports SK Rapid Wien, they cannot support FC Viitorul and cannot be an opponent to FC Vaduz.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: It is false that Oliver is a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From the third premise, a supporter of SK Rapid Wien cannot be an opponent to FC Vaduz. Oliver is not an opponent to FC Vaduz, which is consistent with being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n- However, a supporter of SK Rapid Wien also cannot be a supporter of FC Viitorul. Oliver is not a supporter of FC Viitorul, which is also consistent with being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nGiven the premises:\n- Oliver not being an opponent to FC Vaduz does not contradict being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n- Oliver not being a supporter of FC Viitorul does not contradict being a supporter of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nTherefore, the premises do not logically lead to the conclusion that Oliver cannot be a supporter of SK Rapid Wien. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
