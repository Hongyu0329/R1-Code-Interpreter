    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every aunt of Rosa who is a sister of Amanda is also a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n   - This premise establishes a conditional relationship: If someone is both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda, then that person is a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: It is not the case that Amy is an aunt of Rosa.\n   - This premise explicitly states that Amy does not fulfill the condition of being an aunt of Rosa.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Amy is a sister of Amanda.\n   - This premise confirms that Amy fulfills the condition of being a sister of Amanda.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Hence, Amy is not a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n   - The conclusion is that Amy does not fulfill the condition of being a great-grandmother of Hellen.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- According to Premise 1, to be a great-grandmother of Hellen, one must be both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda.\n- Premise 2 tells us that Amy is not an aunt of Rosa, which means she does not meet the first part of the condition required by Premise 1.\n- Therefore, even though Amy is a sister of Amanda (Premise 3), she does not meet the full condition of being both an aunt of Rosa and a sister of Amanda.\n- As a result, Amy cannot be a great-grandmother of Hellen based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument follows logically from the premises: if Amy does not meet the necessary conditions outlined in Premise 1, then she cannot be a great-grandmother of Hellen. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
