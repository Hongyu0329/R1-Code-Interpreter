    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\"\n   - This establishes a relationship between Cecil and Tyler, indicating that they are schoolmates.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Nobody is neither a schoolmate of Tyler nor a nephew of Owen.\"\n   - This is a double negative statement. Simplifying it, it means that everyone is either a schoolmate of Tyler or a nephew of Owen (or both).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"So, necessarily, Cecil is not a nephew of Owen.\"\n   - The argument concludes that Cecil cannot be a nephew of Owen.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler.\n- From Premise 2, we know that everyone must be either a schoolmate of Tyler or a nephew of Owen.\n- Since Cecil is already established as a schoolmate of Tyler (from Premise 1), Premise 2 does not require him to be a nephew of Owen. However, Premise 2 does not explicitly state that being a schoolmate of Tyler excludes the possibility of also being a nephew of Owen.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The argument concludes that Cecil is not a nephew of Owen based on the premises.\n- However, the premises do not logically exclude the possibility of Cecil being both a schoolmate of Tyler and a nephew of Owen. The premises only require that Cecil be at least one of these, which he is (a schoolmate of Tyler).\n- Therefore, the conclusion that Cecil is necessarily not a nephew of Owen does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
