    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n   - This establishes a specific familial relationship between Darwin and Dewayne.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne is an ancestor of Leslie.\n   - This is a conditional statement. It can be broken down as follows:\n     - If a person is not both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne, then that person is an ancestor of Leslie.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: It follows that it is false that Darwin is an ancestor of Leslie.\n   - This conclusion directly contradicts the conditional statement in Premise 2 if Darwin does not meet the criteria of being both a half-brother of Alvin and a grandson of Dewayne.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - From Premise 1, we know Darwin is a grandson of Dewayne.\n   - To determine if Darwin is an ancestor of Leslie, we need to check if he is a half-brother of Alvin.\n   - The argument does not provide information about whether Darwin is a half-brother of Alvin.\n   - If Darwin is not a half-brother of Alvin, then according to Premise 2, he would be an ancestor of Leslie, contradicting the conclusion.\n   - If Darwin is a half-brother of Alvin, then Premise 2 does not apply to him, and the conclusion that he is not an ancestor of Leslie could be true.\n   - However, without explicit information about Darwin being a half-brother of Alvin, we cannot definitively conclude that the premises lead to the conclusion.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The argument relies on an unstated assumption about Darwin's relationship with Alvin.\n   - Since the premises do not provide enough information to definitively support the conclusion, the argument is not deductively valid.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
