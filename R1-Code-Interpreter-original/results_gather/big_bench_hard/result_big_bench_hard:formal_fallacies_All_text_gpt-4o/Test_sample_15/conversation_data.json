Next, being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ. Plus,being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some backer of BSC Young Boys is a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who supports BSC Young Boys, criticizes Trabzonspor AŞ, and is knowledgeable about Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n   - This implies that if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, then they are necessarily a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n   - This means that if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, they must be an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n**Conclusion**: There is somebody who is a backer of BSC Young Boys and an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know there is a person who is both a backer of BSC Young Boys and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- From Premise 3, being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is necessary for being an ex-fan of NK Maribor. This means that if someone is an ex-fan of NK Maribor, they must be an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. However, being an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen does not necessarily mean they are an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n- Premise 2 states that being an ex-fan of NK Maribor is sufficient for being a critic of Trabzonspor AŞ. This does not directly help us establish a connection between being a backer of BSC Young Boys and being an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nThe conclusion requires that there is a person who is both a backer of BSC Young Boys and an ex-fan of NK Maribor. However, the premises do not provide a direct logical connection that guarantees this conclusion. The premises allow for the possibility that the person who is a backer of BSC Young Boys and an expert of Bayer 04 Leverkusen is not necessarily an ex-fan of NK Maribor.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
