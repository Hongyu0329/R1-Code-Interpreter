    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Whatever is an ingredient of Vertica Rush and an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\"\n   - This can be expressed as: If something is an ingredient of both Vertica Rush and Liqua Versa Gel, then it is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: \"Every ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.\"\n   - This can be expressed as: If something is an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad, then it is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or it is not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.\n\n3. **Logical Analysis**:\n   - The premise states a condition about ingredients that are common to both Vertica Rush and Liqua Versa Gel, specifically that such ingredients cannot be in Eyeshadow Quad.\n   - The conclusion is attempting to state a condition about ingredients of Eyeshadow Quad, specifically that they cannot be in both Liqua Versa Gel and Vertica Rush simultaneously.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The premise can be rewritten in logical terms as: If \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), then not \\( C \\). (Where \\( A \\) is \"ingredient of Vertica Rush\", \\( B \\) is \"ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel\", and \\( C \\) is \"ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad\").\n   - The conclusion can be rewritten as: If \\( C \\), then not \\( A \\) or not \\( B \\).\n\n5. **Checking Validity**:\n   - The conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n   - Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument deductively valid.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
