    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Being an ex-fan of Villarreal CF is necessary for being a member of SK Rapid Wien.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, then they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF. In logical terms, if \\( M \\) represents being a member of SK Rapid Wien and \\( E \\) represents being an ex-fan of Villarreal CF, the premise can be expressed as: \\( M \\rightarrow E \\).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Some supporter of Östersunds FK is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\"\n   - This means there exists at least one person who supports Östersunds FK and is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF. In logical terms, if \\( S \\) represents being a supporter of Östersunds FK, the premise can be expressed as: \\( \\exists x (S(x) \\land \\neg E(x)) \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Somebody is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not a member of SK Rapid Wien.\"\n   - This conclusion states that there exists at least one person who supports Östersunds FK and is not a member of SK Rapid Wien. In logical terms, this can be expressed as: \\( \\exists x (S(x) \\land \\neg M(x)) \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1 (\\( M \\rightarrow E \\)), we know that if someone is a member of SK Rapid Wien, they must be an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n- From Premise 2 (\\( \\exists x (S(x) \\land \\neg E(x)) \\)), we know there is at least one person who supports Östersunds FK and is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF.\n- If someone is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF (\\( \\neg E \\)), they cannot be a member of SK Rapid Wien (\\( \\neg M \\)), because being an ex-fan of Villarreal CF is necessary for being a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nTherefore, the person who supports Östersunds FK and is not an ex-fan of Villarreal CF cannot be a member of SK Rapid Wien. This directly supports the conclusion that there exists someone who is a supporter of Östersunds FK and not a member of SK Rapid Wien.\n\nThe argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
