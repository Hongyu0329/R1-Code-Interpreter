    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **First Premise:** \"Being a workmate of Monte is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: If someone is not an ancestor of Patrick, then they must be a workmate of Monte.\n   - Symbolically: If \\( \\neg A_P \\) (not an ancestor of Patrick), then \\( W_M \\) (workmate of Monte).\n\n2. **Second Premise:** \"Not being an ancestor of Nathan is sufficient for not being a workmate of Monte.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: If someone is not an ancestor of Nathan, then they are not a workmate of Monte.\n   - Symbolically: If \\( \\neg A_N \\) (not an ancestor of Nathan), then \\( \\neg W_M \\) (not a workmate of Monte).\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Being an ancestor of Nathan is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: If someone is not an ancestor of Patrick, then they must be an ancestor of Nathan.\n   - Symbolically: If \\( \\neg A_P \\), then \\( A_N \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From the first premise, we have: \\( \\neg A_P \\rightarrow W_M \\).\n- From the second premise, we have: \\( \\neg A_N \\rightarrow \\neg W_M \\).\n\nWe need to determine if these premises logically lead to the conclusion: \\( \\neg A_P \\rightarrow A_N \\).\n\n**Logical Analysis:**\n\n- From the first premise, if \\( \\neg A_P \\), then \\( W_M \\).\n- From the second premise, if \\( \\neg A_N \\), then \\( \\neg W_M \\).\n\nTo satisfy both premises simultaneously:\n- If \\( \\neg A_P \\) (not an ancestor of Patrick), then \\( W_M \\) (workmate of Monte) must be true.\n- However, if \\( \\neg A_N \\) (not an ancestor of Nathan), then \\( \\neg W_M \\) (not a workmate of Monte) must be true.\n\nThis creates a contradiction if both \\( \\neg A_P \\) and \\( \\neg A_N \\) are true, as one would imply \\( W_M \\) and the other \\( \\neg W_M \\).\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction:\n- If \\( \\neg A_P \\) is true, \\( \\neg A_N \\) cannot be true, meaning \\( A_N \\) must be true.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg A_P \\rightarrow A_N \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
