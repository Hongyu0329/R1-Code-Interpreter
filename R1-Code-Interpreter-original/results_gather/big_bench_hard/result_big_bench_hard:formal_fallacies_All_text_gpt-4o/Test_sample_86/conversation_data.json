    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap is a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n   - This means if someone is a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap, then they must be a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a rare consumer of Camay soap is necessary for being a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap.\n   - This implies that if someone is a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap, they must also be a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Not every infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo is both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is an infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo and is not both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Somebody is an infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo and not a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap.\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we can deduce that if someone is a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap, they must be both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n- Premise 3 states that not every infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo fits this description (being both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap).\n- Therefore, there must be at least one infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo who does not meet the criteria of being both a frequent consumer of Sexy Hair shampoo and a rare consumer of Camay soap.\n- If someone is not a rare consumer of Camay soap, they cannot be a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap (from Premise 2).\n- Thus, there exists at least one infrequent user of Organix Hair shampoo who is not a rare consumer of Pre De Provence soap.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
