  "question": "\"Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: Every expert of AS Saint-Étienne is an admirer of FC Krasnodar. Every ex-fan of FC Sion is not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor. Being an admirer of FC Krasnodar is necessary for being an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor. We may conclude: Being an ex-fan of FC Sion is sufficient for being an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every expert of AS Saint-Étienne is an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n   - This means if someone is an expert of AS Saint-Étienne, then they must also be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ex-fan of FC Sion is not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, then they are either not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor (or both).\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Being an admirer of FC Krasnodar is necessary for being an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n   - This means if someone is an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, then they must be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Being an ex-fan of FC Sion is sufficient for being an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n   - This means if someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, then they must be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 3, we know that to be an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, one must be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is an ex-fan of FC Sion, they are either not an expert of AS Saint-Étienne or not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor.\n- If they are not an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, Premise 3 does not apply directly. However, if they are an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, they must be an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n- Premise 1 does not directly affect the conclusion since it only relates experts of AS Saint-Étienne to admirers of FC Krasnodar.\n\nThe conclusion states that being an ex-fan of FC Sion is sufficient for being an admirer of FC Krasnodar. However, the premises do not provide a direct link that guarantees this conclusion. The premises allow for the possibility that an ex-fan of FC Sion might not be an ex-fan of Osmanlıspor, in which case Premise 3 does not ensure they are an admirer of FC Krasnodar.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not deductively valid because the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
