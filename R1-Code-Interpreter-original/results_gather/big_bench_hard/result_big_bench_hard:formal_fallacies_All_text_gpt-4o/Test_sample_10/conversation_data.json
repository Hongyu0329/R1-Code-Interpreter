The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, no member of Juventus is an expert of Getafe CF. Next, somebody is a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF. So, necessarily, not every follower of West Ham United FC is a member of Juventus.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"No member of Juventus is an expert of Getafe CF.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a member of Juventus, they cannot be an expert of Getafe CF.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Somebody is a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF.\"\n   - This indicates that there exists at least one person who is both a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Not every follower of West Ham United FC is a member of Juventus.\"\n   - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one follower of West Ham United FC who is not a member of Juventus.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, we know there is at least one person who is both a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF.\n- From Premise 1, we know that no member of Juventus can be an expert of Getafe CF.\n- Therefore, the person who is both a follower of West Ham United FC and an expert of Getafe CF cannot be a member of Juventus.\n- This directly supports the conclusion that not every follower of West Ham United FC is a member of Juventus, as we have identified at least one such person who is not.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
