    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. **Identify the Premise:**\n   - The premise given is: \"Being a cousin of Chris is sufficient for not being a son of Kermit.\"\n\n2. **Understand the Premise:**\n   - This means that if someone is a cousin of Chris, then they are not a son of Kermit. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n     - If A (being a cousin of Chris), then B (not being a son of Kermit).\n\n3. **Identify the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion drawn is: \"Whoever is not a son of Kermit is a cousin of Chris.\"\n\n4. **Understand the Conclusion:**\n   - This conclusion suggests that if someone is not a son of Kermit, then they must be a cousin of Chris. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n     - If B (not being a son of Kermit), then A (being a cousin of Chris).\n\n5. **Analyze the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise provides a conditional statement: If A, then B.\n   - The conclusion attempts to reverse this conditional: If B, then A.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Validity:**\n   - The logical structure of the argument is attempting to affirm the converse of the original conditional statement.\n   - In logic, the converse of a true conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because \"If A, then B\" is true, it does not mean \"If B, then A\" is true.\n   - Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\n7. **Determine the Validity:**\n   - Since the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<answer>>> invalid"
