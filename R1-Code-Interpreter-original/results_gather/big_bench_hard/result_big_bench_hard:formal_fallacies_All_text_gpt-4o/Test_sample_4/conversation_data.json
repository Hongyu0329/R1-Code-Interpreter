    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - **First Premise:** Being an expert of Aberdeen FC is sufficient for not being a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n     - This can be interpreted as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n     - Symbolically: If A (expert of Aberdeen FC), then not M (not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid).\n\n   - **Second Premise:** Every expert of Aberdeen FC is not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n     - This can be interpreted as: If someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are either not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n     - Symbolically: If A, then not Z (not a fan of AZ Alkmaar) or not M.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion is: Whoever is an expert of Aberdeen FC is not a fan of AZ Alkmaar.\n   - Symbolically: If A, then not Z.\n\n3. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - From the first premise, we have: If A, then not M.\n   - From the second premise, we have: If A, then not Z or not M.\n   - The conclusion we want to reach is: If A, then not Z.\n\n4. **Checking Validity:**\n   - The second premise already states that if someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, then they are either not a fan of AZ Alkmaar or not a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid.\n   - The first premise ensures that if someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, they cannot be a follower of Club Atlético de Madrid (not M).\n   - Therefore, combining these, if someone is an expert of Aberdeen FC, they must satisfy both conditions: not M (from the first premise) and not Z or not M (from the second premise).\n   - Since not M is always true for an expert of Aberdeen FC (from the first premise), the \"or\" condition in the second premise simplifies to not Z being true.\n   - Thus, the conclusion \"If A, then not Z\" logically follows from the premises.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
