    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Being an ancestor of Christy is necessary for being a daughter of Denise.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a daughter of Denise, then they must be an ancestor of Christy. In logical terms, if D (being a daughter of Denise) is true, then A (being an ancestor of Christy) must also be true. This can be expressed as: D → A.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Not being a cousin of Maryann is sufficient for not being an ancestor of Christy.\"\n   - This means that if someone is not a cousin of Maryann, then they are not an ancestor of Christy. In logical terms, if ¬C (not being a cousin of Maryann) is true, then ¬A (not being an ancestor of Christy) must also be true. This can be expressed as: ¬C → ¬A.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Whoever is not a daughter of Denise is a cousin of Maryann.\"\n   - This means that if someone is not a daughter of Denise, then they must be a cousin of Maryann. In logical terms, if ¬D (not being a daughter of Denise) is true, then C (being a cousin of Maryann) must also be true. This can be expressed as: ¬D → C.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1 (D → A), we know that if someone is not an ancestor of Christy (¬A), then they cannot be a daughter of Denise (¬D). This is the contrapositive of Premise 1: ¬A → ¬D.\n\n- From Premise 2 (¬C → ¬A), we know that if someone is not a cousin of Maryann, then they are not an ancestor of Christy.\n\n- We need to determine if the conclusion (¬D → C) logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the conclusion: ¬C → D. This would mean that if someone is not a cousin of Maryann, then they are a daughter of Denise.\n\n- From Premise 2, we have ¬C → ¬A. If we combine this with the contrapositive of Premise 1 (¬A → ¬D), we get ¬C → ¬D. This means that if someone is not a cousin of Maryann, then they are not a daughter of Denise.\n\n- However, the contrapositive of the conclusion (¬C → D) suggests the opposite: that if someone is not a cousin of Maryann, then they are a daughter of Denise.\n\nSince ¬C → ¬D contradicts ¬C → D, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
