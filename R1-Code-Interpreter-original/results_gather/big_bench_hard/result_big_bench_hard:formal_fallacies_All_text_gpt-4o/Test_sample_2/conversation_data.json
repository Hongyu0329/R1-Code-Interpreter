    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n   - This premise establishes that Vitamin A is definitely found in LIQUID EYELINER.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml is not an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n   - This premise can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, then it is either not an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER (or both).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: It is not the case that Vitamin A is an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\n   - The conclusion claims that Vitamin A is not an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n- From Premise 2, if Vitamin A were an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml, it would have to be either not an ingredient of Mango Lip Butter or not an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER.\n- However, since Vitamin A is an ingredient of LIQUID EYELINER (from Premise 1), the only way for Premise 2 to hold true is if Vitamin A is not an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml.\n- Therefore, the conclusion that Vitamin A is not an ingredient of BC Eye Cream 15 ml logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This means the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
