  "question": "\"Is Siri a stepsister of Mary? Is Susan related to Kate? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, being a close friend of Catherine is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie. Now, being a granddaughter of Courtney is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie. Moreover, whoever is not a classmate of Mary is however a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney. In consequence, whoever is not a classmate of Leslie is a classmate of Mary.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a close friend of Catherine is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie.\n   - This implies that if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be a close friend of Catherine.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a granddaughter of Courtney is necessary for not being a classmate of Leslie.\n   - This implies that if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be a granddaughter of Courtney.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is not a classmate of Mary is a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n   - This implies that if someone is not a classmate of Mary, they must be either a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Whoever is not a classmate of Leslie is a classmate of Mary.\n   - This is the statement we need to evaluate based on the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we know that not being a classmate of Leslie requires being a close friend of Catherine and being a granddaughter of Courtney.\n- From Premise 3, we know that not being a classmate of Mary requires being a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney.\n- The conclusion states that if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be a classmate of Mary.\n\n**Logical Deduction**:\n- If someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they must be both a close friend of Catherine and a granddaughter of Courtney (from Premises 1 and 2).\n- If someone is a close friend of Catherine or a granddaughter of Courtney, they are not a classmate of Mary (from Premise 3).\n- Therefore, if someone is not a classmate of Leslie, they cannot be not a classmate of Mary, meaning they must be a classmate of Mary.\n\nThe argument logically follows from the premises to the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
