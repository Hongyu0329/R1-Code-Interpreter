    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a cousin of Lawrence is sufficient for being a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This means if someone is a cousin of Lawrence, then they are also a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Somebody is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n   - This introduces a person who is a close friend of Philip but does not meet the condition of being a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence.\n   - This conclusion suggests that there exists at least one close friend of Philip who is not a cousin of Lawrence.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a cousin of Lawrence, they must be a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n- From Premise 2, we have a person who is a close friend of Philip and not a schoolmate of Kenneth.\n- Since this person is not a schoolmate of Kenneth, according to Premise 1, they cannot be a cousin of Lawrence.\n- Therefore, this person serves as an example of a close friend of Philip who is not a cousin of Lawrence.\n\nThe argument logically follows from the premises to the conclusion. The existence of a close friend of Philip who is not a schoolmate of Kenneth directly supports the conclusion that not every close friend of Philip is a cousin of Lawrence.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
