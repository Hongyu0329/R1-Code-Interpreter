    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, then that thing is not an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies or not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit.\n   - This can be represented as: ¬S → (¬N ∨ ¬E)\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit is necessary for not being an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101.\n   - This can be represented as: ¬E → I (where I represents being an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101)\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whatever is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 is an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies.\n   - This can be represented as: ¬I → N\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Necessarily, nothing is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.\n   - This can be represented as: ¬(¬I ∧ ¬S)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2 (¬E → I), we know that if something is not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit, it must be an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101.\n- From Premise 3 (¬I → N), we know that if something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101, it must be an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies.\n- From Premise 1 (¬S → (¬N ∨ ¬E)), if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, it must either not be an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies or not be an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion ¬(¬I ∧ ¬S), which means that it is not the case that something is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX.\n\n- If something is not an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (¬I), by Premise 3, it must be an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies (N).\n- If something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (¬S), by Premise 1, it must either not be an ingredient of NYC Nail Glossies (¬N) or not be an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit (¬E).\n- If it is not an ingredient of Eyebrow Kit (¬E), by Premise 2, it must be an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 (I).\n\nThus, if something is not an ingredient of Skin Tint FX (¬S), it cannot be the case that it is neither an ingredient of EYE SHADOW No 101 nor an ingredient of Skin Tint FX, because it would lead to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
