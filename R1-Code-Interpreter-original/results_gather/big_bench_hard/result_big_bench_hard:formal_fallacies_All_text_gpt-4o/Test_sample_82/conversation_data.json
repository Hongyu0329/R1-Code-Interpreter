    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - The first premise states: \"Whoever is a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy is not a great-grandmother of Jaime.\"\n   - This means that if someone is both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy, then they cannot be a great-grandmother of Jaime.\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion drawn is: \"Everyone who is not a great-grandmother of Jaime is however a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\"\n   - This implies that if someone is not a great-grandmother of Jaime, then they must be both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise provides a conditional statement: If someone is both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy, then they are not a great-grandmother of Jaime.\n   - The conclusion attempts to reverse this logic: If someone is not a great-grandmother of Jaime, then they must be both a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Validity:**\n   - The premise does not logically support the conclusion. The premise only states a condition under which someone is not a great-grandmother of Jaime, but it does not imply that the absence of being a great-grandmother of Jaime necessitates being a great-grandmother of Dawn and a sister of Nancy.\n   - The conclusion is an invalid inference because it assumes a biconditional relationship (if and only if) from a unidirectional conditional statement (if-then).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
