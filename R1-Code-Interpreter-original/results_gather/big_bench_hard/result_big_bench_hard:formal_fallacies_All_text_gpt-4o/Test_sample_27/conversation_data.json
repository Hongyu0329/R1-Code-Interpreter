    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every schoolmate of Jeffery is a grandson of Todd.\n   - This means if someone is a schoolmate of Jeffery, then they are a grandson of Todd.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is a schoolmate of Jeffery is at least one of these: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern.\n   - This means if someone is a schoolmate of Jeffery, they must be at least one of the following: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Every schoolmate of Jeffery is an uncle of Lavern.\n   - This means if someone is a schoolmate of Jeffery, then they are an uncle of Lavern.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Jeffery is a brother of Kenneth, too.\n   - This is what we need to determine as valid or invalid based on the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that every schoolmate of Jeffery is a grandson of Todd.\n- From Premise 3, we know that every schoolmate of Jeffery is also an uncle of Lavern.\n- Premise 2 states that a schoolmate of Jeffery must be at least one of the following: a grandson of Todd, a brother of Kenneth, or an uncle of Lavern. Since every schoolmate of Jeffery is already a grandson of Todd (Premise 1) and an uncle of Lavern (Premise 3), Premise 2 is satisfied without needing to be a brother of Kenneth.\n\nThe conclusion states that every schoolmate of Jeffery is a brother of Kenneth. However, the premises do not provide any information that directly links being a schoolmate of Jeffery to being a brother of Kenneth. The premises only ensure that schoolmates of Jeffery are grandsons of Todd and uncles of Lavern, which satisfies Premise 2 without needing the condition of being a brother of Kenneth.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
