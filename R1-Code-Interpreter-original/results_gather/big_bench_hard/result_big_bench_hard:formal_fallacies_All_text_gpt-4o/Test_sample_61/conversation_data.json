    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - Premise 1: \"Every uncle of Harvey is not an ancestor of Adrian.\"\n     - This means that if someone is an uncle of Harvey, then that person cannot be an ancestor of Adrian.\n   - Premise 2: \"Every uncle of Harvey is not a nephew of Ward.\"\n     - This means that if someone is an uncle of Harvey, then that person cannot be a nephew of Ward.\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - Conclusion: \"No nephew of Ward and no ancestor of Adrian is an uncle of Harvey.\"\n     - This means that if someone is a nephew of Ward, then that person cannot be an uncle of Harvey.\n     - Additionally, if someone is an ancestor of Adrian, then that person cannot be an uncle of Harvey.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premises state conditions about uncles of Harvey, specifically that they cannot be ancestors of Adrian or nephews of Ward.\n   - The conclusion states that if someone is a nephew of Ward or an ancestor of Adrian, they cannot be an uncle of Harvey.\n\n4. **Checking for Logical Consistency:**\n   - The premises provide conditions that exclude certain individuals from being uncles of Harvey based on their relationships to Adrian and Ward.\n   - The conclusion is essentially a restatement of these exclusions in a different form, asserting that those who are excluded (nephews of Ward and ancestors of Adrian) cannot be uncles of Harvey.\n\n5. **Evaluating Deductive Validity:**\n   - A deductive argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n   - In this case, the conclusion directly follows from the premises. The premises exclude certain individuals from being uncles of Harvey, and the conclusion states that these excluded individuals are indeed not uncles of Harvey.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
