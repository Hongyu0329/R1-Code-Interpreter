    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"No half-sister of Nelda is a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a half-sister of Nelda, then they cannot be a close friend of Terrie and they cannot be a cousin of Amanda.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"It is false that Gretchen is a close friend of Terrie.\"\n   - This means that Gretchen is not a close friend of Terrie.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: \"Moreover, it is false that Gretchen is a cousin of Amanda.\"\n   - This means that Gretchen is not a cousin of Amanda.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \"We may conclude: It is not the case that Gretchen is a half-sister of Nelda.\"\n   - The conclusion states that Gretchen is not a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- According to Premise 1, if someone is a half-sister of Nelda, they cannot be a close friend of Terrie or a cousin of Amanda.\n- Premises 2 and 3 state that Gretchen is neither a close friend of Terrie nor a cousin of Amanda.\n- The conclusion claims that Gretchen is not a half-sister of Nelda.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 provides a condition for being a half-sister of Nelda: not being a close friend of Terrie and not being a cousin of Amanda.\n- Premises 2 and 3 confirm that Gretchen meets this condition (she is neither a close friend of Terrie nor a cousin of Amanda).\n- However, meeting the condition (not being a close friend of Terrie and not being a cousin of Amanda) does not necessarily mean Gretchen cannot be a half-sister of Nelda. The premises do not provide information that would exclude Gretchen from being a half-sister of Nelda based on the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Gretchen is not a half-sister of Nelda does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is deductively invalid because the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
