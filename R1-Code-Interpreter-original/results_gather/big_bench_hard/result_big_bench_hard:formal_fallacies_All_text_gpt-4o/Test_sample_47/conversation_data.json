    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis:**\n   - The premise states: \"Every close friend of Myra is neither a cousin of Sue nor a daughter of Tommy.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a close friend of Myra, then they cannot be a cousin of Sue and they cannot be a daughter of Tommy.\n\n2. **Conclusion Analysis:**\n   - The conclusion drawn is: \"No cousin of Sue and no daughter of Tommy is a close friend of Myra.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a cousin of Sue, they cannot be a close friend of Myra, and if someone is a daughter of Tommy, they cannot be a close friend of Myra.\n\n3. **Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise is structured as: If A (close friend of Myra), then not B (cousin of Sue) and not C (daughter of Tommy).\n   - The conclusion is structured as: If B (cousin of Sue), then not A (close friend of Myra) and if C (daughter of Tommy), then not A (close friend of Myra).\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence:**\n   - The premise is essentially stating a conditional: If A, then not B and not C.\n   - The conclusion is stating the contrapositive of the premise: If B, then not A and if C, then not A.\n   - In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n5. **Validity Determination:**\n   - Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is deductively valid. The truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nBased on the analysis, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
