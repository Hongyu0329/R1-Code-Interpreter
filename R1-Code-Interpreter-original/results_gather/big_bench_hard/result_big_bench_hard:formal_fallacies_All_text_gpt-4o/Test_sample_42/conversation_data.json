    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - The first premise states: \"Every ingredient of Moisturizing Bar is neither an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR nor an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM.\"\n     - This means that if something is an ingredient of the Moisturizing Bar, it cannot be an ingredient of either 31 EYE COLOUR or VITAMIN E BB CREAM.\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion is: \"So, necessarily, whatever is none of this: an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM or ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR, is an ingredient of Moisturizing Bar.\"\n     - This implies that if something is not an ingredient of VITAMIN E BB CREAM and not an ingredient of 31 EYE COLOUR, then it must be an ingredient of the Moisturizing Bar.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise provides a condition about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar, specifically that they do not overlap with the ingredients of the other two products.\n   - The conclusion attempts to assert that anything not in the other two products must be in the Moisturizing Bar.\n\n4. **Checking for Logical Consistency:**\n   - The premise only states a condition about the ingredients of the Moisturizing Bar, not about the ingredients of the other two products.\n   - The conclusion, however, makes a universal claim about all ingredients not in the other two products, which is not supported by the premise.\n   - The premise does not provide information about the exclusivity or exhaustiveness of the ingredients across the three products.\n\n5. **Evaluating Deductive Validity:**\n   - For the argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises.\n   - In this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise because the premise does not establish that the only possible ingredients are those in the three products, nor does it establish that all non-overlapping ingredients must belong to the Moisturizing Bar.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premise.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
