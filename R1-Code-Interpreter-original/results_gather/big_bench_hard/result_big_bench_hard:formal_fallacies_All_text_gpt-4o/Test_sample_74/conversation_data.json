The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm. Everything that is an ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, too. In consequence, every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm and an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone?.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, then it is either not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm (or both).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Everything that is an ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch, too.\n   - This means that if something is an ingredient of Black Shadow, it must also be an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm and an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone?.\n   - This conclusion claims that if something is an ingredient of Black Shadow, it must be an ingredient of both Exfoliating Balm and Ice Queen Anyone?.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that every ingredient of Black Shadow is also an ingredient of Hawaiian Punch.\n- According to Premise 1, every ingredient of Hawaiian Punch is either not an ingredient of Ice Queen Anyone? or not an ingredient of Exfoliating Balm.\n- Therefore, if something is an ingredient of Black Shadow (and thus Hawaiian Punch), it cannot be an ingredient of both Ice Queen Anyone? and Exfoliating Balm simultaneously, as per Premise 1.\n\nThe conclusion contradicts Premise 1 because it states that every ingredient of Black Shadow is an ingredient of both Exfoliating Balm and Ice Queen Anyone?, which is not possible given Premise 1.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
