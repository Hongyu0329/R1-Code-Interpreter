    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n   - This means if someone is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945, they must have been a fan of KF Skënderbeu in the past.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945 is an opponent to OGC Nice.\n   - This means if someone is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945, they are also an opponent of OGC Nice.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Some fan of Burnley FC is an opponent to OGC Nice and an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n   - This means there exists at least one fan of Burnley FC who is both an opponent of OGC Nice and was previously a fan of KF Skënderbeu.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Some fan of Burnley FC is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945.\n   - The conclusion claims that there is at least one fan of Burnley FC who is an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we know that to be an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945, one must be both an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu and an opponent of OGC Nice.\n- Premise 3 provides that there is a fan of Burnley FC who meets both these conditions (being an ex-fan of KF Skënderbeu and an opponent of OGC Nice).\n- Therefore, based on the premises, this fan of Burnley FC satisfies the conditions to be an expert of PFC Ludogorets 1945.\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
