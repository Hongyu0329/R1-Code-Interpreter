The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Whoever is not a workmate of Hilda is a stepsister of Heather.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Whoever is not a workmate of Hilda is a stepsister of Heather.\n   - This means that if someone is not a workmate of Hilda, they must be a stepsister of Heather.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every workmate of Hilda is either a stepsister of Heather or an aunt of Clara, or both.\n   - This means that if someone is a workmate of Hilda, they must be at least one of the following: a stepsister of Heather, an aunt of Clara, or both.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda.\n   - This implies that if someone is a workmate of Hilda, they must be an aunt of Clara.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, we know that a workmate of Hilda can be a stepsister of Heather, an aunt of Clara, or both. \n- The conclusion states that being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda, which means that every workmate of Hilda must be an aunt of Clara.\n- However, Premise 2 allows for the possibility that a workmate of Hilda could be only a stepsister of Heather and not an aunt of Clara. This contradicts the conclusion that being an aunt of Clara is necessary for being a workmate of Hilda.\n\nSince the premises allow for a workmate of Hilda to not be an aunt of Clara, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
