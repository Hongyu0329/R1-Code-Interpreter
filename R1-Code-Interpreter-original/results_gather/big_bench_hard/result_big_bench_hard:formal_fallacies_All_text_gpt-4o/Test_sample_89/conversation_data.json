    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Justin is not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn.\"\n   - This is a disjunction (either-or statement). It means at least one of the following is true:\n     - Justin is not an uncle of Roberto.\n     - Justin is not a workmate of Glenn.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Every great-grandfather of Reyes is an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\"\n   - This is a universal statement. It means:\n     - If someone is a great-grandfather of Reyes, then that person is both an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"It is not the case that Justin is a great-grandfather of Reyes.\"\n   - This is a negation. It means:\n     - Justin is not a great-grandfather of Reyes.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, if Justin were a great-grandfather of Reyes, then he would have to be both an uncle of Roberto and a workmate of Glenn.\n- However, Premise 1 states that Justin is not an uncle of Roberto or not a workmate of Glenn. This means that at least one of these conditions is false for Justin.\n- Therefore, Justin cannot satisfy both conditions required to be a great-grandfather of Reyes.\n- As a result, the conclusion that Justin is not a great-grandfather of Reyes logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\nFinal answer: <<<valid>>>"
