    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Andres is a member of Paris Saint-Germain.\"\n   - This establishes that Andres is part of the Paris Saint-Germain club.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"It is false that Andres is a follower of FC Mariupol.\"\n   - This means Andres does not follow FC Mariupol.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: \"Whoever is a follower of FC Mariupol and a member of Paris Saint-Germain is also a devotee of FC Arouca.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It states that if someone is both a follower of FC Mariupol and a member of Paris Saint-Germain, then they are a devotee of FC Arouca.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \"Therefore, Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca.\"\n   - The argument concludes that Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The third premise provides a condition for being a devotee of FC Arouca: being both a follower of FC Mariupol and a member of Paris Saint-Germain.\n- According to the second premise, Andres is not a follower of FC Mariupol. Therefore, the condition in the third premise is not satisfied for Andres.\n- Since the condition is not satisfied, the third premise does not apply to Andres, and we cannot conclude from it that Andres is a devotee of FC Arouca.\n\nThe conclusion that Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca is consistent with the premises because the condition for being a devotee (as per the third premise) is not met. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nHowever, the argument is structured to show that Andres is not a devotee of FC Arouca, which is consistent with the premises. The premises do not lead to a contradiction, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
