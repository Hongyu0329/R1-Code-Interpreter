    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Being an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig is necessary for being an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB.\"\n   - This can be expressed as: If something is an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB, then it must be an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\text{FACIAL SCRUB} \\rightarrow \\text{Eye Definer Twig} \\)\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Not being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is sufficient for not being an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\"\n   - This can be expressed as: If something is not an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder, then it is not an ingredient of Eye Definer Twig.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg \\text{NARS Pressed Powder} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Eye Definer Twig} \\)\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Being an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder is necessary for being an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB.\"\n   - This can be expressed as: If something is an ingredient of FACIAL SCRUB, then it must be an ingredient of NARS Pressed Powder.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\text{FACIAL SCRUB} \\rightarrow \\text{NARS Pressed Powder} \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we have: \\( \\text{FACIAL SCRUB} \\rightarrow \\text{Eye Definer Twig} \\)\n- From Premise 2, we have: \\( \\neg \\text{NARS Pressed Powder} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Eye Definer Twig} \\)\n\nUsing the contrapositive of Premise 2, we can deduce: \n- \\( \\text{Eye Definer Twig} \\rightarrow \\text{NARS Pressed Powder} \\)\n\nNow, we have:\n- \\( \\text{FACIAL SCRUB} \\rightarrow \\text{Eye Definer Twig} \\) (from Premise 1)\n- \\( \\text{Eye Definer Twig} \\rightarrow \\text{NARS Pressed Powder} \\) (from the contrapositive of Premise 2)\n\nBy the transitive property of implication, we can conclude:\n- \\( \\text{FACIAL SCRUB} \\rightarrow \\text{NARS Pressed Powder} \\)\n\nThis matches the conclusion of the argument. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
