The following argument pertains to this question: To start with, every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.

Therefore, every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n   - This means if someone criticizes FC Ufa, they must support İstanbul Başakşehir.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir or a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n   - This expands the possibilities for critics of FC Ufa. They can be supporters of İstanbul Başakşehir, critics of PFC CSKA Moskva, or experts of Randers FC.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every critic of FC Ufa is a critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or an expert of Randers FC.\n   - This conclusion suggests that critics of FC Ufa must be either critics of PFC CSKA Moskva or experts of Randers FC, excluding the possibility of being just supporters of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that every critic of FC Ufa is a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir.\n- Premise 2 allows for additional possibilities (critic of PFC CSKA Moskva or expert of Randers FC) but does not negate the requirement from Premise 1.\n- The conclusion, however, excludes the possibility of being just a supporter of İstanbul Başakşehir, which contradicts Premise 1.\n\nSince the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises (as it excludes a possibility that is explicitly stated in Premise 1), the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
