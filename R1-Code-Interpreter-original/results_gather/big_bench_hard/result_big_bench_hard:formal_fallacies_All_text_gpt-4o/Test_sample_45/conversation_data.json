    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premise:**\n   - The first premise states: \"Not being a close friend of Williams is sufficient for not being a nephew of Rolando.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: If someone is not a close friend of Williams, then they are not a nephew of Rolando.\n   - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If not P (not a close friend of Williams), then not Q (not a nephew of Rolando).\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion derived from the premise is: \"Every nephew of Rolando is a close friend of Williams.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If Q (a nephew of Rolando), then P (a close friend of Williams).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise provides a conditional statement: If not P, then not Q.\n   - The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise: If Q, then P.\n   - In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. **Determining Validity:**\n   - Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is deductively valid.\n   - The conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
