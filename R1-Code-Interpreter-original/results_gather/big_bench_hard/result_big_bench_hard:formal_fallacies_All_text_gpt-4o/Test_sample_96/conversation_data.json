    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Being an ingredient of Gorgeous is necessary for not being an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is not an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow, then it must be an ingredient of Gorgeous.\n   - In logical terms: If not Baked Eyeshadow, then Gorgeous.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Something is not an ingredient of Gorgeous and, in addition, not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: There exists something that is not an ingredient of Gorgeous and either not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n   - In logical terms: There exists an x such that (not Gorgeous(x) and (not Coverage Duo(x) or not Deternined(x))).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"There is something that is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow and not both an ingredient of Coverage Duo and an ingredient of Deternined.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: There exists something that is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow and either not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n   - In logical terms: There exists an x such that (Baked Eyeshadow(x) and (not Coverage Duo(x) or not Deternined(x))).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if something is not an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow, it must be an ingredient of Gorgeous.\n- Premise 2 states that there is something that is not an ingredient of Gorgeous. This implies that this something must be an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow (from Premise 1).\n- Premise 2 also states that this something is either not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n- Therefore, this something satisfies the condition of the conclusion: it is an ingredient of Baked Eyeshadow and either not an ingredient of Coverage Duo or not an ingredient of Deternined.\n\nThe premises logically lead to the conclusion, making the argument deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
