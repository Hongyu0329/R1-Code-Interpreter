    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **First Premise**: Every opponent to AS Roma is a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin or a fan of AC Sparta Praha or not a fan of FCSB.\n   - This means if someone is an opponent to AS Roma, they must satisfy at least one of the following conditions:\n     - Be a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin.\n     - Be a fan of AC Sparta Praha.\n     - Not be a fan of FCSB.\n\n2. **Second Premise**: No fan of FCSB is an expert of FK Sūduva.\n   - This implies that if someone is a fan of FCSB, they cannot be an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n3. **Third Premise**: Every fan of AC Sparta Praha is an expert of FK Sūduva.\n   - This means if someone is a fan of AC Sparta Praha, they must be an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n4. **Fourth Premise**: Being an expert of FK Sūduva is necessary for being a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin.\n   - This implies that if someone is a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, they must be an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Being an expert of FK Sūduva is necessary for being an opponent to AS Roma.\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From the first premise, an opponent to AS Roma must be a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, a fan of AC Sparta Praha, or not a fan of FCSB.\n- From the second premise, if someone is not a fan of FCSB, there is no direct information about their expertise in FK Sūduva.\n- From the third premise, if someone is a fan of AC Sparta Praha, they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n- From the fourth premise, if someone is a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, they are an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios for an opponent to AS Roma:\n- If they are a backer of Hertha BSC Berlin, they must be an expert of FK Sūduva (from the fourth premise).\n- If they are a fan of AC Sparta Praha, they must be an expert of FK Sūduva (from the third premise).\n- If they are not a fan of FCSB, the premises do not provide direct information about their expertise in FK Sūduva, but they could still be an expert of FK Sūduva.\n\nIn all scenarios where the premises provide information, being an expert of FK Sūduva is necessary for being an opponent to AS Roma. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
