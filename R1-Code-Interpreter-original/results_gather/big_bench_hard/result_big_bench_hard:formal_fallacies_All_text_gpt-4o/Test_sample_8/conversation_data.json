    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - Premise 1: \"Not being an opponent to FC Utrecht is sufficient for not being an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\"\n     - This can be rephrased as: If a person is not an opponent to FC Utrecht, then they are not an admirer of St Johnstone FC.\n     - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If not Opponent(FC Utrecht), then not Admirer(St Johnstone FC).\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - Conclusion: \"Everyone who is an admirer of St Johnstone FC is an opponent to FC Utrecht, too.\"\n     - This can be rephrased as: If a person is an admirer of St Johnstone FC, then they are an opponent to FC Utrecht.\n     - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If Admirer(St Johnstone FC), then Opponent(FC Utrecht).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise provides a conditional statement: If not Opponent(FC Utrecht), then not Admirer(St Johnstone FC).\n   - The conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise: If Admirer(St Johnstone FC), then Opponent(FC Utrecht).\n   - In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n4. **Determining Validity:**\n   - Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and they are logically equivalent, the argument is deductively valid. The truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
