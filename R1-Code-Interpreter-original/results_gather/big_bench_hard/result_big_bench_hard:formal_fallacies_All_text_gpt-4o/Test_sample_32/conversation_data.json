  "question": "\"Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, everyone who is both an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK is a follower of Liverpool FC, too. Second, being an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is sufficient for not being an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol. Third, whoever is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK. In consequence, every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is both an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK is a follower of Liverpool FC.\n   - This premise establishes a condition: if someone is both an opponent of Real Sociedad and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş, then they must be a follower of Liverpool.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is sufficient for not being an opponent to Real Sociedad de Fútbol.\n   - This premise tells us that if someone admires HŠK Zrinjski, they cannot be an opponent of Real Sociedad.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Whoever is an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş JK.\n   - This premise indicates that if someone admires HŠK Zrinjski, they cannot be an ex-fan of Beşiktaş.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC.\n   - The conclusion claims that if someone admires HŠK Zrinjski, they must be a follower of Liverpool.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, if someone admires HŠK Zrinjski, they are not an opponent of Real Sociedad.\n- From Premise 3, if someone admires HŠK Zrinjski, they are not an ex-fan of Beşiktaş.\n- To satisfy Premise 1 and become a follower of Liverpool, a person must be both an opponent of Real Sociedad and an ex-fan of Beşiktaş. However, Premises 2 and 3 ensure that an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski can be neither.\n- Therefore, an admirer of HŠK Zrinjski cannot meet the conditions of Premise 1 to be a follower of Liverpool.\n\nThe conclusion that every admirer of HŠK Zrinjski is a follower of Liverpool FC does not logically follow from the premises. The premises do not provide a valid deductive path to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
