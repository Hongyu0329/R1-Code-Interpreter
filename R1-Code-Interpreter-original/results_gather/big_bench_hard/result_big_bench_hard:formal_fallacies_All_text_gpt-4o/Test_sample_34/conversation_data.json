    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and see if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, then that person is not a backer of FC Augsburg or not a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not Feyenoord, then not FC Augsburg or not AS Monaco FC.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a devotee of AS Monaco FC is necessary for not being a member of AC Milan.\n   - This can be expressed as: If not AC Milan, then AS Monaco FC.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a backer of FC Augsburg.\n   - This can be expressed as: Everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a backer of FC Augsburg.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Nobody is neither a member of AC Milan nor a follower of Feyenoord.\n   - This can be expressed as: Everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a follower of Feyenoord.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 3, we know that everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a backer of FC Augsburg.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is not a member of AC Milan, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n- From Premise 1, if someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, they must be either a backer of FC Augsburg or a devotee of AS Monaco FC.\n\nLet's consider the implications:\n\n- If someone is not a member of AC Milan, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC (Premise 2).\n- If they are a devotee of AS Monaco FC, they could still be a backer of FC Augsburg or a follower of Feyenoord (Premise 1).\n- If someone is not a follower of Feyenoord, they must be a backer of FC Augsburg or a devotee of AS Monaco FC (Premise 1).\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows:\n\n- The conclusion states that everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a follower of Feyenoord.\n- From Premise 3, everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a backer of FC Augsburg.\n- If someone is not a member of AC Milan, they must be a devotee of AS Monaco FC (Premise 2).\n- If they are a devotee of AS Monaco FC, they could still be a backer of FC Augsburg or a follower of Feyenoord (Premise 1).\n\nThe conclusion that everyone is either a member of AC Milan or a follower of Feyenoord does not necessarily follow from the premises. The premises do not eliminate the possibility of someone being a backer of FC Augsburg without being a follower of Feyenoord.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
