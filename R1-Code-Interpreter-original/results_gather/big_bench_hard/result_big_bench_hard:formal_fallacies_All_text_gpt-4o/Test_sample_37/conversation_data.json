    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Whoever is an uncle of Owen is not a nephew of Gene.\n   - This means if someone is an uncle of Owen, they cannot be a nephew of Gene.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David is a schoolmate of Steve or an uncle of Owen.\n   - This means if someone is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David, they must either be a schoolmate of Steve or an uncle of Owen.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Steve is a nephew of Gene.\n   - This means if someone is a schoolmate of Steve, they must also be a nephew of Gene.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Every brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is not a nephew of Gene.\n   - This conclusion states that if someone is both a brother of David and a nephew of Ignacio, they cannot be a nephew of Gene.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, if someone is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David, they are either a schoolmate of Steve or an uncle of Owen.\n- From Premise 3, if they are a schoolmate of Steve, they must be a nephew of Gene.\n- From Premise 1, if they are an uncle of Owen, they cannot be a nephew of Gene.\n\n**Logical Deduction**:\n- If a person is both a nephew of Ignacio and a brother of David, they have two possibilities:\n  1. They are a schoolmate of Steve, which makes them a nephew of Gene.\n  2. They are an uncle of Owen, which means they are not a nephew of Gene.\n- The conclusion states that every brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is not a nephew of Gene. This conclusion can only be true if the only possibility for such a person is to be an uncle of Owen (and not a schoolmate of Steve).\n\n**Validity Check**:\n- The premises allow for the possibility that a brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio could be a schoolmate of Steve, which would make them a nephew of Gene.\n- Therefore, the conclusion that every brother of David who is a nephew of Ignacio is not a nephew of Gene does not necessarily follow from the premises, as there is a scenario where they could be a nephew of Gene.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
