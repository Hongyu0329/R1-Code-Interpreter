    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premise:**\n   - The first premise states: \"Nobody is neither a workmate of Calvin nor a schoolmate of Barton.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: Everyone is either a workmate of Calvin or a schoolmate of Barton (or both).\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion is: \"Being a workmate of Calvin is necessary for not being a schoolmate of Barton.\"\n   - This implies that if someone is not a schoolmate of Barton, then they must be a workmate of Calvin.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise essentially states that for any person, at least one of the two conditions must be true: being a workmate of Calvin or being a schoolmate of Barton.\n   - The conclusion suggests a conditional relationship: if not a schoolmate of Barton, then a workmate of Calvin.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Validity:**\n   - The premise allows for three possibilities:\n     1. A person is a workmate of Calvin and not a schoolmate of Barton.\n     2. A person is not a workmate of Calvin but is a schoolmate of Barton.\n     3. A person is both a workmate of Calvin and a schoolmate of Barton.\n   - The conclusion, however, only considers the first possibility as necessary for not being a schoolmate of Barton.\n   - The premise does not exclude the possibility of someone being both a workmate of Calvin and a schoolmate of Barton, which means the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The argument is not deductively valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The premise allows for the possibility of someone being both a workmate of Calvin and a schoolmate of Barton, which contradicts the necessity implied in the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
