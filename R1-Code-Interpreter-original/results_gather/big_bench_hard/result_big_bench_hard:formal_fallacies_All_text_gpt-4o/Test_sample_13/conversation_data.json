    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ancestor of Jonathan is sufficient for not being a grandson of Carmelo.\n   - This means if someone is an ancestor of Jonathan, they cannot be a grandson of Carmelo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is an ancestor of Jonathan is not a schoolmate of Reyes.\n   - This implies that if someone is an ancestor of Jonathan, they cannot be a schoolmate of Reyes.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Every grandson of Carmelo who is a schoolmate of Reyes is also a close friend of Clifford.\n   - This means if someone is both a grandson of Carmelo and a schoolmate of Reyes, then they are a close friend of Clifford.\n\n**Conclusion**: Being an ancestor of Jonathan is sufficient for being a close friend of Clifford.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that an ancestor of Jonathan cannot be a grandson of Carmelo.\n- From Premise 2, we know that an ancestor of Jonathan cannot be a schoolmate of Reyes.\n- Premise 3 states a condition for being a close friend of Clifford: being both a grandson of Carmelo and a schoolmate of Reyes. However, an ancestor of Jonathan cannot satisfy both conditions simultaneously because they cannot be a schoolmate of Reyes (Premise 2) and cannot be a grandson of Carmelo (Premise 1).\n\nThe conclusion states that being an ancestor of Jonathan is sufficient for being a close friend of Clifford. However, none of the premises provide a direct link between being an ancestor of Jonathan and being a close friend of Clifford. The premises only establish conditions under which someone cannot be a close friend of Clifford, but they do not establish that being an ancestor of Jonathan leads to being a close friend of Clifford.\n\nTherefore, the argument does not logically follow from the premises, making it deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
