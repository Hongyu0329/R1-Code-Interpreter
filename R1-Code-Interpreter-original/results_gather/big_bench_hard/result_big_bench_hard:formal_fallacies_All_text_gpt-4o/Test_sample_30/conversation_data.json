The following argument pertains to this question: To start with, every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach. Now, being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach. Moreover, nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n   - This means if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they must be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach.\n   - This implies that if someone is not an expert of SCR Altach, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC.\n   - This means everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\n**Conclusion**: Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro.\n   - This suggests that if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they are either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is not an expert of SCR Altach, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n- From Premise 3, everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion logically follows from these premises:\n- If someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, by Premise 1, they are either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.\n- If they are not an expert of SCR Altach, by Premise 2, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n- By Premise 3, if they are not an opponent to West Ham United FC, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC.\n\nThus, in all cases, if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, they must be a backer of Chelsea FC, which aligns with the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
