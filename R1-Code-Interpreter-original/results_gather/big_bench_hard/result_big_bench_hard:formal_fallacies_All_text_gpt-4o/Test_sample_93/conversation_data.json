    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises:**\n   - **First Premise:** \"Being a friend of Kilmarnock FC is sufficient for not being an admirer of The New Saints FC.\"\n     - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a friend of Kilmarnock FC, then they are not an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n     - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If F (friend of Kilmarnock FC), then not A (not an admirer of The New Saints FC).\n\n   - **Second Premise:** \"It is false that Maximo is an admirer of The New Saints FC.\"\n     - This means: Maximo is not an admirer of The New Saints FC.\n     - In logical terms, this is: not A.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - Conclusion: \"We may conclude that it is false that Maximo is a friend of Kilmarnock FC.\"\n     - This means: Maximo is not a friend of Kilmarnock FC.\n     - In logical terms, this is: not F.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Argument:**\n   - The first premise establishes a conditional relationship: If F, then not A.\n   - The second premise provides not A (Maximo is not an admirer of The New Saints FC).\n   - The conclusion claims not F (Maximo is not a friend of Kilmarnock FC).\n\n4. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - The argument structure is:\n     - If F, then not A.\n     - not A.\n     - Therefore, not F.\n   - This is a classic example of the logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" Just because not A is true, it does not logically follow that not F must be true. The premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude not F.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
