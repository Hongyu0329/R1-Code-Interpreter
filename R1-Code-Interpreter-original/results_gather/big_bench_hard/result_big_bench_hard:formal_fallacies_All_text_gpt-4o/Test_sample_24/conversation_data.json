    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\"\n   - This means that everyone is either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap (or both).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Nobody is neither a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\"\n   - This means that everyone is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap (or both).\n\n3. **Premise 3**: \"Every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\"\n   - This means that if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo (or both).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \"Being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap.\"\n   - This means that if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must also be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that everyone is either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n- From Premise 2, we know that everyone is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.\n- From Premise 3, if someone is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n\nNow, let's consider someone who is an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap:\n- According to Premise 3, they must be either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n- If they are a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap, Premise 1 is satisfied.\n- If they are a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo, Premise 2 is satisfied.\n- In both cases, they do not necessarily have to be an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap, as they can satisfy the conditions by being either a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap does not logically follow from the premises. The premises do not force the conclusion to be true in all cases.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
