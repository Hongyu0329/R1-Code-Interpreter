    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being an ingredient of Aquablush is sufficient for being an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n   - This means if something is an ingredient of Aquablush, it must also be an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whatever is neither an ingredient of Stop and Stare nor an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or an ingredient of Aquablush.\n   - This means if something is not an ingredient of Stop and Stare and not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, then it must be an ingredient of either Lash Tinsel Mascara or Aquablush.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Everything that is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara is an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n   - This means if something is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara, it must also be an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Whatever is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow is however an ingredient of Stop and Stare or an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This is the statement we need to verify based on the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, if something is an ingredient of Aquablush, it is also an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n- From Premise 3, if something is an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara, it is also an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n- From Premise 2, if something is neither an ingredient of Stop and Stare nor A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, it must be an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or Aquablush, and thus, by Premises 1 and 3, it must be an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow.\n\nTherefore, if something is not an ingredient of NARS Duo Eyeshadow, it cannot be an ingredient of Lash Tinsel Mascara or Aquablush. Consequently, it must be an ingredient of either Stop and Stare or A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, which matches the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
