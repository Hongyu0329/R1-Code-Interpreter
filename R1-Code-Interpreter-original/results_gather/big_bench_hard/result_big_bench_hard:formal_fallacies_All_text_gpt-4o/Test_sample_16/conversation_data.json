    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Whoever is an expert of BSC Young Boys is not an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\"\n   - This means that if someone is an expert of BSC Young Boys, they cannot be an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Whoever is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is not an expert of BSC Young Boys.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, they cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"No friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv is an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\"\n   - This conclusion suggests that if someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, they cannot be an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys.\n- From Premise 1, we know that an expert of BSC Young Boys cannot be an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié.\n- Therefore, if someone is a friend of FC Dynamo Kyiv, they cannot be an expert of BSC Young Boys, and thus, they cannot be an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié (since being an expert of BSC Young Boys is a necessary condition for being an ex-fan of Real Betis Balompié).\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is structured such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
