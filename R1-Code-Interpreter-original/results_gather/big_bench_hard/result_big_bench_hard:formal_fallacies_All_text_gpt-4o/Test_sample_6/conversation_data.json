  "question": "\"Is Titanium oxide an ingredient of my washing power? Which chemicals does my perfume contain? It is really difficult to keep track of all chemicals one is regularly exposed to. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Every ingredient of Sahara Saphire is both an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and an ingredient of Brushless Mascara. Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap. Therefore, Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\"\nIs the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?\nOptions:\n- valid \n- invalid\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every ingredient of Sahara Saphire is both an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap and an ingredient of Brushless Mascara.\n   - This means if something is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire, it must also be found in both Pink Lotion Soap and Brushless Mascara.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Cocamide is an ingredient of Pink Lotion Soap.\n   - This tells us that Cocamide is found in Pink Lotion Soap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire.\n   - The argument concludes that because Cocamide is in Pink Lotion Soap, it must also be in Sahara Saphire.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The premises do not provide a direct link from Cocamide being in Pink Lotion Soap to it being in Sahara Saphire.\n- Premise 1 only states that ingredients of Sahara Saphire are also in Pink Lotion Soap and Brushless Mascara, not the other way around.\n- There is no premise stating that if something is in Pink Lotion Soap, it must be in Sahara Saphire.\n- Therefore, the conclusion that Cocamide is an ingredient of Sahara Saphire does not logically follow from the premises provided.\n\nGiven this analysis, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
