    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some regular consumer of AXE shampoo is not an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who regularly uses AXE shampoo and does not occasionally purchase Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Everyone who is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap is an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n   - This implies that if someone is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap, they must also be an occasional purchaser of Sexy Hair shampoo.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Somebody is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap.\n   - The conclusion suggests that there exists at least one person who regularly uses AXE shampoo and does not regularly use Nubian Heritage soap.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know there is at least one person who uses AXE shampoo and does not purchase Sexy Hair shampoo occasionally.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap, they must purchase Sexy Hair shampoo occasionally.\n- Therefore, the person mentioned in Premise 1, who does not purchase Sexy Hair shampoo occasionally, cannot be a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap. This directly supports the conclusion that there is someone who is a regular consumer of AXE shampoo and not a regular user of Nubian Heritage soap.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
