    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Everyone who is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal is not a son of Ronald.\"\n   - This premise establishes a condition: If someone is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal, then they cannot be a son of Ronald.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"It is false that Santo is a son of Ronald.\"\n   - This premise directly states that Santo is not a son of Ronald.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"So, necessarily, Santo is a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\"\n   - The conclusion claims that because Santo is not a son of Ronald, he must be either a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The first premise provides a sufficient condition for not being a son of Ronald: being a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\n- The second premise confirms that Santo is not a son of Ronald.\n- However, the conclusion attempts to assert that because Santo is not a son of Ronald, he must fulfill the condition of being a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal.\n\n**Logical Structure**:\n- The argument assumes that the only way for someone to not be a son of Ronald is to be a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal. However, the first premise only states that being a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal is a sufficient condition for not being a son of Ronald, not a necessary one.\n- There could be other reasons or conditions under which someone is not a son of Ronald that are not covered by the first premise.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The argument is invalid because the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion. The premises do not establish that being a half-brother of Ronny or a classmate of Sal is the only way to not be a son of Ronald.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
