    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Being a stepbrother of Benjamin is necessary for being a grandson of Alan.\n   - This means if someone is a grandson of Alan, then they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every half-brother of Melvin is a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n   - This means if someone is a half-brother of Melvin, then they are also a stepbrother of Benjamin.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: Everyone who is not a cousin of Solomon and not a stepbrother of Dominic is a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin.\n   - This means if someone is neither a cousin of Solomon nor a stepbrother of Dominic, then they must be either a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: So, necessarily, someone who is not a stepbrother of Benjamin is a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic.\n   - This is the statement we need to verify based on the premises.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n- From Premise 1, if someone is a grandson of Alan, they must be a stepbrother of Benjamin. Therefore, if someone is not a stepbrother of Benjamin, they cannot be a grandson of Alan.\n  \n- From Premise 2, if someone is a half-brother of Melvin, they are a stepbrother of Benjamin. Therefore, if someone is not a stepbrother of Benjamin, they cannot be a half-brother of Melvin.\n\n- From Premise 3, if someone is neither a cousin of Solomon nor a stepbrother of Dominic, they must be either a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin. However, if they are not a stepbrother of Benjamin, they cannot be either a grandson of Alan or a half-brother of Melvin (from the analysis of Premises 1 and 2).\n\n- Therefore, if someone is not a stepbrother of Benjamin, they must be either a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic to satisfy Premise 3.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, as the only way for someone not to be a stepbrother of Benjamin is if they are a cousin of Solomon or a stepbrother of Dominic.\n\nThus, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<answer>>>valid"
