    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Premise:**\n   - The premise states: \"No son of Alexander who is an ancestor of Ahmed is a great-grandfather of Ronny.\"\n   - This means that if someone is both a son of Alexander and an ancestor of Ahmed, then that person cannot be a great-grandfather of Ronny.\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion drawn is: \"No great-grandfather of Ronny is an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\"\n   - This conclusion is making two claims:\n     a. No great-grandfather of Ronny is an ancestor of Ahmed.\n     b. No great-grandfather of Ronny is a son of Alexander.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logical Flow:**\n   - The premise provides a condition about individuals who are both sons of Alexander and ancestors of Ahmed, stating they cannot be great-grandfathers of Ronny.\n   - The conclusion, however, makes a broader claim about all great-grandfathers of Ronny, stating none of them can be either an ancestor of Ahmed or a son of Alexander.\n\n4. **Checking for Logical Consistency:**\n   - The premise only restricts a specific group (sons of Alexander who are ancestors of Ahmed) from being great-grandfathers of Ronny.\n   - The conclusion, however, extends this restriction to all great-grandfathers of Ronny, which is not supported by the premise.\n   - The premise does not provide information about great-grandfathers of Ronny who are not sons of Alexander or not ancestors of Ahmed.\n\n5. **Evaluating Deductive Validity:**\n   - For an argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises.\n   - In this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise because the premise does not address all great-grandfathers of Ronny, only a specific subset.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premise.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
