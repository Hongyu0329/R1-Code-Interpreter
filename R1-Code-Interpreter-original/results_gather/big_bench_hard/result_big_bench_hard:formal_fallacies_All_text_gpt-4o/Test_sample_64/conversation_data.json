    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis:**\n   - The first premise states: \"Every fan of FC Lugano is neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\"\n     - This can be interpreted as: If someone is a fan of FC Lugano, then they are not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and they are not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem.\n     - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If A (fan of FC Lugano), then not B (devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva) and not C (ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem).\n\n2. **Conclusion Analysis:**\n   - The conclusion states: \"Whoever is none of this: a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva or ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, is a fan of FC Lugano.\"\n     - This can be interpreted as: If someone is not a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva and not an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem, then they are a fan of FC Lugano.\n     - In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If not B and not C, then A.\n\n3. **Logical Structure:**\n   - The premise provides a conditional statement: If A, then not B and not C.\n   - The conclusion attempts to reverse this: If not B and not C, then A.\n\n4. **Validity Check:**\n   - For an argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must logically follow from the premises.\n   - The premise states a condition for being a fan of FC Lugano, but it does not state that being neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem is sufficient to be a fan of FC Lugano.\n   - The conclusion attempts to reverse the premise, which is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because all fans of FC Lugano are neither devotees of PFC CSKA Moskva nor ex-supporters of SV Zulte Waregem, it does not mean that everyone who is neither a devotee of PFC CSKA Moskva nor an ex-supporter of SV Zulte Waregem is a fan of FC Lugano.\n\n5. **Final Determination:**\n   - The argument is attempting to reverse the logical implication, which is not valid. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
