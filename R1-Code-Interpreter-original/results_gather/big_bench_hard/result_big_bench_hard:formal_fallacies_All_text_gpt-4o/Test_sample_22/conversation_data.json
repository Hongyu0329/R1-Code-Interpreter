    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some uncle of Dominic is a schoolmate of Earl.\n   - This means there exists at least one person who is both an uncle of Dominic and a schoolmate of Earl.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Everyone who is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey is not a schoolmate of Earl.\n   - This implies that if someone is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey, they cannot be a schoolmate of Earl.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Some uncle of Dominic is not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey.\n   - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one uncle of Dominic who is either not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know there is at least one uncle of Dominic who is a schoolmate of Earl.\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey, they cannot be a schoolmate of Earl.\n- Therefore, the uncle of Dominic who is a schoolmate of Earl cannot be both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey, because that would contradict Premise 2.\n- Thus, this uncle of Dominic must be either not an uncle of Reyes or not an uncle of Corey.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The premises ensure that there is an uncle of Dominic who cannot be both an uncle of Reyes and an uncle of Corey, which directly supports the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
