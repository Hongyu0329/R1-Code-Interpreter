    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a close friend of Glenna is a close friend of Tamara.\n   - This establishes a direct relationship between being a close friend of Glenna and being a close friend of Tamara. If someone is a close friend of Glenna, they must also be a close friend of Tamara.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Glenna.\n   - This premise provides a condition for being a close friend of Glenna. If a person is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Glenna.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Whoever is none of this: a half-sister of Deborah or workmate of Nila, is a close friend of Tamara.\n   - The conclusion states that if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then they are a close friend of Tamara.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 2, we know that if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, they are a close friend of Glenna.\n- From Premise 1, we know that if someone is a close friend of Glenna, they are also a close friend of Tamara.\n- Therefore, if someone is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, they are a close friend of Glenna, and by Premise 1, they must also be a close friend of Tamara.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The premises provide a chain of reasoning that leads directly to the conclusion without any gaps or additional assumptions. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
