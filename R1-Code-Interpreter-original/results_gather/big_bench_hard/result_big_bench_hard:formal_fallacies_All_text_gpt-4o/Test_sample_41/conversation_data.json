The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, everyone who is a schoolmate of Mildred is a daughter of Jeanette, too. Now, being a daughter of Jeanette is sufficient for not being a cousin of Cristi.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Everyone who is a schoolmate of Mildred is a daughter of Jeanette.\n   - This establishes a relationship between being a schoolmate of Mildred and being a daughter of Jeanette. If someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, then they must also be a daughter of Jeanette.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Being a daughter of Jeanette is sufficient for not being a cousin of Cristi.\n   - This means that if someone is a daughter of Jeanette, they cannot be a cousin of Cristi.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: No schoolmate of Mildred is a cousin of Cristi.\n   - The conclusion is that if someone is a schoolmate of Mildred, they cannot be a cousin of Cristi.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, we know that all schoolmates of Mildred are daughters of Jeanette.\n- From Premise 2, we know that all daughters of Jeanette are not cousins of Cristi.\n- Therefore, by combining these two premises, we can deduce that all schoolmates of Mildred are not cousins of Cristi.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. The premises provide a chain of reasoning that leads directly to the conclusion without any gaps or additional assumptions. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
