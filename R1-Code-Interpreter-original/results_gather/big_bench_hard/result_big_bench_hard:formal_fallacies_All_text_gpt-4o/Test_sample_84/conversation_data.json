The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, not being an ingredient of Pink Smoothie is sufficient for not being an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Not being an ingredient of Pink Smoothie is sufficient for not being an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is not an ingredient of Pink Smoothie, then it is not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - In logical terms: If not P, then not A.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Everything that is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER, then it is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n   - In logical terms: If I, then A.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n   - This can be interpreted as: If something is an ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER, then it is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n   - In logical terms: If I, then P.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2 (If I, then A), we know that every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC.\n- Premise 1 states that if something is not an ingredient of Pink Smoothie, then it is not an ingredient of A.D LIPSTICK CHIC (If not P, then not A).\n- To reach the conclusion (If I, then P), we need to establish that every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is also an ingredient of Pink Smoothie.\n\nHowever, the premises do not provide a direct link from ILLUMINIZING POWDER to Pink Smoothie. The premises only establish a relationship between Pink Smoothie and A.D LIPSTICK CHIC, and between ILLUMINIZING POWDER and A.D LIPSTICK CHIC. There is no premise that directly connects ILLUMINIZING POWDER to Pink Smoothie.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that every ingredient of ILLUMINIZING POWDER is an ingredient of Pink Smoothie does not logically follow from the given premises. The argument is deductively invalid because the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the premises.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
