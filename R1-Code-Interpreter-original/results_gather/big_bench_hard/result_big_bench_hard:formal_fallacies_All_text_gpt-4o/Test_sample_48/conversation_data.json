    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\"\n   - This is a straightforward statement establishing a relationship between Carmen and Hattie.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Being a niece of Shona is sufficient for not being a daughter of Hattie.\"\n   - This premise establishes a conditional relationship: If someone is a niece of Shona, then they cannot be a daughter of Hattie.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Carmen is not a niece of Shona.\"\n   - The conclusion is drawn from the premises.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that Carmen is a daughter of Hattie.\n- Premise 2 provides a conditional statement: If someone is a niece of Shona, then they are not a daughter of Hattie.\n- Since Carmen is a daughter of Hattie (Premise 1), according to Premise 2, she cannot be a niece of Shona. \n\nThe argument follows a logical structure where the conclusion directly follows from the premises. The premises lead to the conclusion that Carmen cannot be a niece of Shona because being a niece of Shona would contradict her being a daughter of Hattie.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
