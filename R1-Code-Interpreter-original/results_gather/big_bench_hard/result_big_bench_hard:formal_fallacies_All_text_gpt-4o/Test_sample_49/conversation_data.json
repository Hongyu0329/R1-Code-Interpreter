    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"No ex-supporter of Getafe CF is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\"\n   - This means that if someone is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF, they cannot be a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Everyone who is a friend of R. Charleroi SC is a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\"\n   - This means that if someone is a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they must be a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \"Therefore, whoever is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\"\n   - This conclusion suggests that if someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC, they must be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical flow:\n\n- From Premise 2, we know that being a friend of R. Charleroi SC implies being a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- From Premise 1, we know that being an ex-supporter of Getafe CF implies not being a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- The conclusion attempts to establish a relationship between not being a friend of R. Charleroi SC and being an ex-supporter of Getafe CF.\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n\n- If someone is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC, Premise 2 does not apply to them, so they are not necessarily a critic of Kilmarnock FC.\n- However, Premise 1 does not imply that not being a critic of Kilmarnock FC means one must be an ex-supporter of Getafe CF. It only states that ex-supporters are not critics, not that all non-critics are ex-supporters.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the premises do not establish that not being a friend of R. Charleroi SC necessarily means being an ex-supporter of Getafe CF. The argument is attempting to establish a converse relationship that is not supported by the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\n<<<invalid>>>"
