Second, every fan of FC Utrecht is not an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or not an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.

    "To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every opponent to FC Mariupol is an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n   - This means if someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, they must have been an ex-supporter of either Hertha BSC Berlin or Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Every fan of FC Utrecht is not an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or not an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n   - This means if someone is a fan of FC Utrecht, they cannot have been an ex-supporter of both Hertha BSC Berlin and Bayer 04 Leverkusen. They might have been an ex-supporter of one, but not both.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Being an opponent to FC Mariupol is sufficient for not being a fan of FC Utrecht.\n   - The conclusion claims that if someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, they cannot be a fan of FC Utrecht.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- From Premise 1, if someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, they must have been an ex-supporter of either Hertha BSC Berlin or Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- From Premise 2, if someone is a fan of FC Utrecht, they cannot have been an ex-supporter of both Hertha BSC Berlin and Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n- The conclusion states that being an opponent to FC Mariupol (which implies being an ex-supporter of either Hertha BSC Berlin or Bayer 04 Leverkusen) is sufficient to ensure that one is not a fan of FC Utrecht.\n\nThe premises together imply that if someone is an opponent to FC Mariupol, they must have been an ex-supporter of at least one of the two clubs (Hertha BSC Berlin or Bayer 04 Leverkusen). Since a fan of FC Utrecht cannot have been an ex-supporter of both clubs, the conclusion logically follows that an opponent to FC Mariupol cannot be a fan of FC Utrecht.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n<<<valid>>>"
