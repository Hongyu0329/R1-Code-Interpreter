    "\nassistant > To determine if the sentence is plausible, we need to consider the context of American football:\n\n1. **Tyler Boyd**: He is a professional American football player who plays as a wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n2. **Screen Pass**: This is a type of play in American football where the quarterback throws a short pass to a receiver or running back behind the line of scrimmage, often with blockers in front to help gain yardage.\n\n3. **NFC Divisional Round**: This is a playoff round in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the NFL. The Cincinnati Bengals, Tyler Boyd's team, are part of the American Football Conference (AFC), not the NFC.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is not plausible because Tyler Boyd, as a member of the Cincinnati Bengals, would not be playing in the NFC divisional round.\n\n<<<answer>>> No, the sentence is not plausible. <<<answer>>>"
