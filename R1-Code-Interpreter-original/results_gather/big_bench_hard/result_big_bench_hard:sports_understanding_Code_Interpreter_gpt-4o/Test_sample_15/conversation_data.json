    "\nassistant > In ice hockey, the blue line is a significant part of the rink, marking the boundary of the offensive and defensive zones. Players typically cross the blue line during gameplay. However, Frederik Andersen is a professional ice hockey goaltender, and goaltenders usually do not leave their goal crease to cross the blue line during a game, especially in a high-stakes game like the Stanley Cup. It would be highly unusual and implausible for a goaltender to cross the blue line in such a context.\n\n<<<answer>>> No, the sentence is not plausible."
