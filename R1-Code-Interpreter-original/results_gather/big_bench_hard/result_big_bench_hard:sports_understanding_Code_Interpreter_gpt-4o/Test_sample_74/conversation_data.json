    "\nassistant > The phrase \"hail mary\" is commonly used in sports to describe a long, desperate pass with a low probability of success, typically in American football. Igor Shesterkin is a professional ice hockey goaltender, so the context of a \"hail mary\" would not typically apply to his role in hockey. However, if the sentence is metaphorically describing a desperate or unlikely action taken by Shesterkin, it could be considered plausible in a figurative sense.\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes, the sentence is plausible if used metaphorically."
