Wayne Rooney is a retired professional soccer player from England, known for his career in football (soccer) with Manchester United and the England national team. The Superbowl is an American football championship game, and touchdowns are scored in American football, not soccer. It is highly unlikely for Wayne Rooney, a soccer player, to have participated in the Superbowl and thrown a touchdown.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
