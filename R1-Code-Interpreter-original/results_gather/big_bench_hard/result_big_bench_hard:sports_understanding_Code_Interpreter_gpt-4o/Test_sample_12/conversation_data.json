    "\nassistant > In baseball, a player walks to first base when they receive a base on balls, which occurs when the pitcher throws four pitches outside the strike zone that the batter does not swing at. Jack Flaherty is a professional baseball player known primarily as a pitcher. While pitchers can bat in the National League, it is less common for them to be in a position to walk to first base, especially in a high-stakes game like the National League Championship Series. However, it is not impossible for a pitcher to walk to first base if they are batting and receive a base on balls.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
