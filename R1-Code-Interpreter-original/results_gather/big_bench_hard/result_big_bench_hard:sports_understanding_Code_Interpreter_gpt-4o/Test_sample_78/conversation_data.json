  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > The sentence \"Nazem Kadri was out at home\" is plausible in the context of sports, particularly if referring to a baseball game. In baseball, a player can be \"out at home\" if they are tagged out or forced out while trying to score a run at home plate. However, Nazem Kadri is a professional ice hockey player, not a baseball player. Therefore, the sentence is not plausible in the context of his professional career. \n\n<<<answer>>> No, the sentence is not plausible in the context of Nazem Kadri's professional career as an ice hockey player."
