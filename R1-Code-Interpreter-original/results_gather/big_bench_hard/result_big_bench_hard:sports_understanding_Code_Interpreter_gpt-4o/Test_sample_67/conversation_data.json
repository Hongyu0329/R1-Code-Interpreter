    "\nassistant > In ice hockey, Jordan Binnington is known as a goaltender, not a skater. While it is extremely rare for goaltenders to score goals, it is not impossible. There have been instances in the NHL where goaltenders have scored, usually by shooting the puck into an empty net when the opposing team has pulled their goalie for an extra attacker. However, such events are very uncommon.\n\nGiven this context, the sentence \"Jordan Binnington scored in the third period\" is plausible, but it would be an unusual and noteworthy event.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
