    "\nassistant > The sentence \"Brandin Cooks went for it on fourth down\" is not plausible in the context of American football. Brandin Cooks is a wide receiver, and typically, decisions to \"go for it\" on fourth down are made by the team's coach or quarterback, not by individual players like wide receivers. Wide receivers are responsible for catching passes, not making strategic decisions about whether to attempt a fourth-down conversion.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
