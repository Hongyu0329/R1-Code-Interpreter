    "\nassistant > The sentence \"Robin Lehner launched the desperation heave\" is plausible in the context of sports, particularly ice hockey. Robin Lehner is a professional ice hockey goaltender, and the term \"desperation heave\" could refer to a situation where he makes a last-ditch effort to clear the puck or make a play. While goaltenders typically do not launch the puck down the ice, in rare situations, they might attempt a long pass or clear the puck in a desperate situation.\n\n<<<plausible>>>"
