    "\nassistant > The sentence is not plausible. Fred VanVleet is a professional basketball player, not a soccer player. He plays in the NBA, primarily known for his time with the Toronto Raptors. The Champions League Final refers to a major soccer (football) event, and a \"freekick\" is a term used in soccer, not basketball. Therefore, it is unlikely for Fred VanVleet to score a freekick in the Champions League Final.\n\n<<<answer>>> No, the sentence is not plausible."
