    "\nassistant > To determine if the sentence is plausible, we need to consider T.Y. Hilton's position and typical role in football games. T.Y. Hilton is a professional American football player known for playing as a wide receiver. Wide receivers typically catch passes rather than throw them. However, it is not impossible for a wide receiver to throw a touchdown pass, as trick plays or special situations can occur in football games.\n\nWhile it is uncommon, it is plausible for T.Y. Hilton to have thrown a touchdown pass in a game, including the AFC divisional round, if a trick play was executed.\n\n<<<answer>>> Yes, the sentence is plausible."
