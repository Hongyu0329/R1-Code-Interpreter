    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the object that is directly to the left of the teal object, which is the teal envelope. Let's list the objects in the order they are arranged:\n\n1. Gold pen\n2. Mauve mug\n3. Teal envelope\n4. Red keychain\n5. Turquoise fidget spinner\n\nThe object directly to the left of the teal envelope is the mauve mug. Therefore, the color of the object directly to the left of the teal object is mauve.\n\nNow, let's match this color with the options provided:\n\n- (A) red\n- (B) orange\n- (C) yellow\n- (D) green\n- (E) blue\n- (F) brown\n- (G) magenta\n- (H) fuchsia\n- (I) mauve\n- (J) teal\n- (K) turquoise\n- (L) burgundy\n- (M) silver\n- (N) gold\n- (O) black\n- (P) grey\n- (Q) purple\n- (R) pink\n\nThe correct option for the color mauve is (I).\n\n<<<I>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the table, you see several objects arranged in a row: a gold pen, a mauve mug, a teal envelope, a red keychain, and a turquoise fidget spinner.
