    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the arrangement of the items on the desk and determine how many non-turquoise items are to the left of the magenta sheet of paper.\n\nThe arrangement given is:\n1. Magenta sheet of paper\n2. Pink fidget spinner\n3. Turquoise keychain\n4. Green pen\n\nWe are asked to find the number of non-turquoise things to the left of the magenta sheet of paper. \n\nLet's break it down:\n- The magenta sheet of paper is the first item in the row.\n- There are no items to the left of the magenta sheet of paper.\n\nSince there are no items to the left of the magenta sheet of paper, the number of non-turquoise items to the left is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A) zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the desk, you see a set of things arranged in a row: a magenta sheet of paper, a pink fidget spinner, a turquoise keychain, and a green pen.
