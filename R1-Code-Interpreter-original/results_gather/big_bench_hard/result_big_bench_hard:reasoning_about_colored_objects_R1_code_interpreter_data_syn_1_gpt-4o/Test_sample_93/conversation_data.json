    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the object directly to the left of the silver object in the given arrangement. The objects are arranged in the following order:\n\n1. Mauve pencil\n2. Silver textbook\n3. Blue envelope\n4. Turquoise necklace\n\nThe silver object is the \"silver textbook.\" The object directly to the left of the silver textbook is the \"mauve pencil.\" Therefore, the color of the object directly to the left of the silver object is \"mauve.\"\n\nNow, we need to match this color with the options provided:\n\n- (I) mauve\n\nThe correct option is (I) mauve.\n\n<<<I>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the floor, you see a bunch of objects arranged in a row: a mauve pencil, a silver textbook, a blue envelope, and a turquoise necklace.
