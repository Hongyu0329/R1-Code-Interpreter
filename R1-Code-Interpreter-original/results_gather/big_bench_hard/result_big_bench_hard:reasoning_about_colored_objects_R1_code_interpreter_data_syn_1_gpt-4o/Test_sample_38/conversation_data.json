    "To determine the color of the left-most thing on the desk, we need to analyze the arrangement of the items:\n\n1. The items are arranged in a row as follows: a silver crayon, a green dog leash, and a burgundy booklet.\n2. The left-most item in this arrangement is the silver crayon.\n\nNow, we need to identify the color of the silver crayon from the given options. The color of the silver crayon is \"silver.\"\n\nLet's check the options to find the corresponding color:\n\n- (A) red\n- (B) orange\n- (C) yellow\n- (D) green\n- (E) blue\n- (F) brown\n- (G) magenta\n- (H) fuchsia\n- (I) mauve\n- (J) teal\n- (K) turquoise\n- (L) burgundy\n- (M) silver\n- (N) gold\n- (O) black\n- (P) grey\n- (Q) purple\n- (R) pink\n\nThe option that corresponds to \"silver\" is (M).\n\nTherefore, the color of the left-most thing is \"silver,\" which corresponds to option (M).\n\n<<<M>>>"
