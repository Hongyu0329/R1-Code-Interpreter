    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the color of the object that is directly to the left of the turquoise paperclip. According to the description, the items are arranged in the following order:\n\n1. Black pencil\n2. Turquoise paperclip\n3. Yellow stress ball\n\nThe object directly to the left of the turquoise paperclip is the black pencil. Therefore, the color of the object directly to the left of the paperclip is black.\n\nNow, we need to match this color with the options provided:\n\n- (A) red\n- (B) orange\n- (C) yellow\n- (D) green\n- (E) blue\n- (F) brown\n- (G) magenta\n- (H) fuchsia\n- (I) mauve\n- (J) teal\n- (K) turquoise\n- (L) burgundy\n- (M) silver\n- (N) gold\n- (O) black\n- (P) grey\n- (Q) purple\n- (R) pink\n\nThe correct option that matches the color black is (O).\n\n<<<O>>>"
