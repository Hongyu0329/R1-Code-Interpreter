    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many booklets remain on the desk after removing all the pink items. Let's break down the items on the desk:\n\n1. **Turquoise Plates**: 3\n2. **Pink Plates**: 1\n3. **Pink Booklets**: 3\n\nThe task is to remove all pink items, which include both pink plates and pink booklets. \n\n- Removing the pink plates: 1 pink plate is removed.\n- Removing the pink booklets: 3 pink booklets are removed.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of booklets remaining on the desk:\n\n- Initially, there are 3 pink booklets.\n- After removing all pink items, 0 booklets remain because all booklets were pink.\n\nThus, the number of booklets remaining on the desk is zero.\n\nThe correct option is (A) zero.\n\n<<<zero>>>"
