    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the position of each item in the row and then count the number of non-turquoise items to the left of the yellow item.\n\nLet's list the items in the order they are mentioned:\n\n1. Red cup\n2. Turquoise scrunchiephone charger\n3. Yellow dog leash\n4. Blue pair of sunglasses\n5. Green stress ball\n\nThe yellow item is the \"yellow dog leash,\" which is the third item in the list. We need to count the non-turquoise items to the left of this yellow item.\n\nThe items to the left of the yellow dog leash are:\n1. Red cup\n2. Turquoise scrunchiephone charger\n\nAmong these, the non-turquoise item is:\n1. Red cup\n\nThus, there is one non-turquoise item to the left of the yellow item.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) one.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the table, you see a set of items arranged in a row: a red cup, a turquoise scrunchiephone charger, a yellow dog leash, a blue pair of sunglasses, and a green stress ball.
