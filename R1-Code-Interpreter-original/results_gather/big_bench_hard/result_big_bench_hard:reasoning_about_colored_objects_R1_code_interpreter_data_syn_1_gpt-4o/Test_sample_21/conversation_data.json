    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the objects that are to the left of the teal textbook and count how many of them are non-purple.\n\nLet's list the objects in the order they are arranged:\n\n1. Burgundy necklace\n2. Turquoise cup\n3. Black mug\n4. Teal textbook\n5. Purple jug\n\nThe teal textbook is the fourth object in the list. We need to consider the objects that are to the left of the teal textbook, which are:\n\n1. Burgundy necklace\n2. Turquoise cup\n3. Black mug\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of these objects are non-purple. The objects to the left of the textbook are:\n\n- Burgundy necklace (not purple)\n- Turquoise cup (not purple)\n- Black mug (not purple)\n\nAll three objects are non-purple. Therefore, the number of non-purple objects to the left of the textbook is three.\n\nThe correct option is (D) three.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the desk, you see the following objects arranged in a row: a burgundy necklace, a turquoise cup, a black mug, a teal textbook, and a purple jug.
