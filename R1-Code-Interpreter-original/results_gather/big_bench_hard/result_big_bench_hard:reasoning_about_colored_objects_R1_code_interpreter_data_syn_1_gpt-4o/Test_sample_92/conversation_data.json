    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the position of the turquoise object in the list of objects and then determine the color of the object directly to its left.\n\nThe objects are arranged in the following order:\n1. Mauve keychain\n2. Silver puzzle\n3. Brown bracelet\n4. Red booklet\n5. Turquoise scrunchiephone charger\n6. Burgundy necklace\n\nThe turquoise object is the \"turquoise scrunchiephone charger,\" which is the fifth object in the list. The object directly to the left of the turquoise object is the fourth object, which is the \"red booklet.\"\n\nTherefore, the color of the object directly to the left of the turquoise object is red.\n\n<<<red>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the table, you see a bunch of objects arranged in a row: a mauve keychain, a silver puzzle, a brown bracelet, a red booklet, a turquoise scrunchiephone charger, and a burgundy necklace.
