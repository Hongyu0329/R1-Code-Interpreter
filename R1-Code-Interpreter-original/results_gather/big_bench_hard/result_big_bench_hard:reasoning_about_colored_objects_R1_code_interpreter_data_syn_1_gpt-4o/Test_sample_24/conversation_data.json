    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the position of the yellow object in the sequence and count the number of non-teal objects to its left. The sequence of objects is as follows:\n\n1. Yellow cat toy\n2. Pink stress ball\n3. Silver teddy bear\n4. Brown booklet\n\nThe yellow object is the first in the sequence. Since it is the first object, there are no objects to its left. Therefore, the number of non-teal objects to the left of the yellow object is zero.\n\nNow, let's match this with the given options:\n\n- (A) zero\n- (B) one\n- (C) two\n- (D) three\n- (E) four\n- (F) five\n- (G) six\n\nThe correct answer is (A) zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the table, you see several objects arranged in a row: a yellow cat toy, a pink stress ball, a silver teddy bear, and a brown booklet.
