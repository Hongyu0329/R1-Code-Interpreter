    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the position of each item on the table and then determine how many non-burgundy items are to the right of the mauve booklet.\n\nLet's list the items in the order they are mentioned:\n1. Blue plate\n2. Grey cup\n3. Pink envelope\n4. Burgundy paperclip\n5. Mauve booklet\n6. Gold keychain\n\nThe mauve booklet is the fifth item in the sequence. We need to count the items to the right of the booklet that are not burgundy.\n\nThe items to the right of the mauve booklet are:\n- Gold keychain\n\nNow, we check if these items are non-burgundy:\n- Gold keychain: non-burgundy\n\nThere is only one item to the right of the booklet, and it is non-burgundy.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-burgundy things to the right of the booklet is one.\n\nThe correct option is (B) one.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the table, you see several things arranged in a row: a blue plate, a grey cup, a pink envelope, a burgundy paperclip, a mauve booklet, and a gold keychain.
