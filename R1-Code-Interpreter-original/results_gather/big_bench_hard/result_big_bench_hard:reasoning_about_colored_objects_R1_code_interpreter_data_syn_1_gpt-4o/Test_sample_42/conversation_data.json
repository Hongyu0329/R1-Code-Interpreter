    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of each item on the desk and identify the item that is furthest from the turquoise sheet of paper. Then, we will find the color of that item.\n\nLet's list the items in the order they are arranged:\n\n1. Green plate\n2. Fuchsia teddy bear\n3. Brown scrunchiephone charger\n4. Gold crayon\n5. Burgundy necklace\n6. Turquoise sheet of paper\n\nThe turquoise sheet of paper is the last item in the row. Therefore, the item furthest from it is the first item in the row, which is the green plate.\n\nNow, we need to find the color of the green plate. The color of the green plate is \"green.\"\n\nLet's match this with the options provided:\n\n(A) red\n(B) orange\n(C) yellow\n(D) green\n(E) blue\n(F) brown\n(G) magenta\n(H) fuchsia\n(I) mauve\n(J) teal\n(K) turquoise\n(L) burgundy\n(M) silver\n(N) gold\n(O) black\n(P) grey\n(Q) purple\n(R) pink\n\nThe correct option for the color \"green\" is (D).\n\nTherefore, the color of the item furthest from the turquoise item is green.\n\n<<<D>>>"
