    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the position of each item on the nightstand and determine how many non-mauve items are to the right of the yellow item.\n\n1. List the items in the order they are arranged:\n   - Orange cat toy\n   - Mauve pencil\n   - Black crayon\n   - Yellow pair of sunglasses\n\n2. Identify the position of the yellow item:\n   - The yellow pair of sunglasses is the last item in the row.\n\n3. Determine the items to the right of the yellow item:\n   - Since the yellow pair of sunglasses is the last item, there are no items to its right.\n\n4. Count the non-mauve items to the right of the yellow item:\n   - There are zero items to the right of the yellow pair of sunglasses.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is option (A) zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the nightstand, you see several things arranged in a row: an orange cat toy, a mauve pencil, a black crayon, and a yellow pair of sunglasses.
