    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many scrunchiephone chargers remain on the table after removing all the black items.\n\n1. **Identify the items on the table:**\n   - Three pink scrunchiephone chargers\n   - Two orange crayons\n   - Two black scrunchiephone chargers\n\n2. **Remove all black items:**\n   - The black items are the two black scrunchiephone chargers.\n\n3. **Count the remaining scrunchiephone chargers:**\n   - Initially, there are three pink scrunchiephone chargers and two black scrunchiephone chargers.\n   - After removing the two black scrunchiephone chargers, only the three pink scrunchiephone chargers remain.\n\nThus, the number of scrunchiephone chargers remaining on the table is three.\n\nNow, let's match this with the given options:\n\n- (A) zero\n- (B) one\n- (C) two\n- (D) three\n- (E) four\n- (F) five\n- (G) six\n- (H) seven\n- (I) eight\n- (J) nine\n- (K) ten\n- (L) eleven\n- (M) twelve\n- (N) thirteen\n- (O) fourteen\n- (P) fifteen\n- (Q) sixteen\n\nThe correct option is (D) three.\n\n<<<three>>>"
