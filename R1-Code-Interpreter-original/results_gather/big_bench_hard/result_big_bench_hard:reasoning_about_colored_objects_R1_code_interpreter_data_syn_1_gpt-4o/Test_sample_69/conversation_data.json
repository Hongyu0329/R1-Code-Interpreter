    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the object that is directly to the left of the brown pair of sunglasses in the given sequence of items. The sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Yellow mug\n2. Turquoise notebook\n3. Black crayon\n4. Brown pair of sunglasses\n5. Gold paperclip\n\nThe item directly to the left of the brown pair of sunglasses is the black crayon. Therefore, we need to determine the color of the black crayon from the given options.\n\nThe color of the black crayon is black, which corresponds to option (O).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<O>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    On the desk, you see a set of things arranged in a row: a yellow mug, a turquoise notebook, a black crayon, a brown pair of sunglasses, and a gold paperclip.
