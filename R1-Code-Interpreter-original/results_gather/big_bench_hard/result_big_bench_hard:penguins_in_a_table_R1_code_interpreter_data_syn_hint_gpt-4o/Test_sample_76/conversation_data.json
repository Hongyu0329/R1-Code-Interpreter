    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data about the penguins and determine how many of them meet the criteria of being less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. **Louis**: Age = 7, Weight = 11 kg\n2. **Bernard**: Age = 5, Weight = 13 kg\n3. **Vincent**: Age = 9, Weight = 11 kg\n4. **Gwen**: Age = 8, Weight = 15 kg\n\nNow, we will check each penguin against the criteria:\n\n- **Louis**: Age is 7 (less than 8) and Weight is 11 kg (less than 12 kg). Louis meets both criteria.\n- **Bernard**: Age is 5 (less than 8) but Weight is 13 kg (not less than 12 kg). Bernard does not meet the weight criterion.\n- **Vincent**: Age is 9 (not less than 8). Vincent does not meet the age criterion.\n- **Gwen**: Age is 8 (not less than 8). Gwen does not meet the age criterion.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Louis meets both criteria.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg is 1.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
