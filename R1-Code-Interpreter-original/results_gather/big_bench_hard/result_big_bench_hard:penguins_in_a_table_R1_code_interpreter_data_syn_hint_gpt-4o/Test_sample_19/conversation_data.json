    "To determine the youngest penguin, we need to analyze the given data and identify the penguin with the lowest age. The table provided is:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nHowever, the problem states that Bernard is deleted from the table. After removing Bernard, the table becomes:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nNow, we compare the ages of the remaining penguins:\n\n- Louis: 7 years\n- Vincent: 9 years\n- Gwen: 8 years\n\nThe youngest penguin among the remaining ones is Louis, who is 7 years old.\n\nThe options provided are:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nSince Bernard is removed and James is not in the table, the correct answer is (A) Louis.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
