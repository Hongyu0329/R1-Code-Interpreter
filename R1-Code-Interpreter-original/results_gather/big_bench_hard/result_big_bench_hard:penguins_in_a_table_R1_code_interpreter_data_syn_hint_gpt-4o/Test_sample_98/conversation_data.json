    "To determine the oldest penguin, we need to compare the ages of the penguins listed in the table. The penguins and their ages are as follows:\n\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\nWe need to identify the penguin with the highest age value. Let's compare the ages:\n\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is older than Louis (7), Bernard (5), and Gwen (8).\n\nTherefore, Vincent is the oldest penguin.\n\nThe options provided are:\n(A) Louis\n(B) Bernard\n(C) Vincent\n(D) Gwen\n(E) James\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Vincent.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
