    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the penguin with a height of 0.6 meters. The table provides the height in centimeters, so we need to convert 0.6 meters to centimeters:\n\n\\[ 0.6 \\, \\text{meters} = 60 \\, \\text{centimeters} \\]\n\nNow, we will look for the penguin with a height of 60 cm in the given data:\n\n- Louis: 50 cm\n- Bernard: 80 cm\n- Vincent: 60 cm\n- Gwen: 70 cm\n\nFrom the data, Vincent is the penguin with a height of 60 cm.\n\nTherefore, the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin is Vincent.\n\n<<<Vincent>>>"
