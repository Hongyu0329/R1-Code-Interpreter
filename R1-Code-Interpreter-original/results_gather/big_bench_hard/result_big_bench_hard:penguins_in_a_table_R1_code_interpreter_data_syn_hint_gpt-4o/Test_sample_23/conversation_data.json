  "question": "Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nHow many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?\nOptions:\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n(C) 3\n(D) 4\n(E) 5\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the data provided for each penguin and determine how many meet the criteria of being more than 5 years old and weighing more than 12 kg.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old, 11 kg\n2. Bernard: 5 years old, 13 kg\n3. Vincent: 9 years old, 11 kg\n4. Gwen: 8 years old, 15 kg\n5. James: 12 years old, 12 kg\n\nNow, let's evaluate each penguin against the criteria:\n\n- Louis is more than 5 years old but weighs 11 kg, which is not more than 12 kg.\n- Bernard is 5 years old, which is not more than 5 years old.\n- Vincent is more than 5 years old but weighs 11 kg, which is not more than 12 kg.\n- Gwen is more than 5 years old and weighs 15 kg, which is more than 12 kg.\n- James is more than 5 years old but weighs 12 kg, which is not more than 12 kg.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Gwen meets both criteria.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg is 1.\n\nThe correct option is (A) 1.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
