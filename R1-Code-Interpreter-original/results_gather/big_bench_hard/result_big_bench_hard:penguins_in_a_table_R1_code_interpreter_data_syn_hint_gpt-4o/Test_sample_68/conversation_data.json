    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data about the penguins and apply the specified modifications. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Table of Penguins:**\n   - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Add a New Penguin:**\n   - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n3. **Remove Bernard:**\n   - After adding James, we remove Bernard from the list.\n\n4. **Final List of Penguins:**\n   - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n   - James: age 12, height 90 cm, weight 12 kg\n\n5. **Criteria for Selection:**\n   - Age less than 8 years\n   - Weight less than 12 kg\n\n6. **Check Each Penguin Against the Criteria:**\n   - Louis: age 7, weight 11 kg (meets both criteria)\n   - Vincent: age 9, weight 11 kg (does not meet age criteria)\n   - Gwen: age 8, weight 15 kg (does not meet either criteria)\n   - James: age 12, weight 12 kg (does not meet either criteria)\n\nFrom the final list, only Louis meets both criteria of being less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins that meet the criteria is 1.\n\n<<<'answer'>>> A"
