  "question": "Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nWe then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\nWhat is the cumulated weight of the penguins?\nOptions:\n(A) 37\n(B) 49\n(C) 50\n(D) 62\n(E) 63\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the penguins after adding James and removing Bernard.\n\n1. **Initial Table of Penguins:**\n   - Louis: 7 years, 50 cm, 11 kg\n   - Bernard: 5 years, 80 cm, 13 kg\n   - Vincent: 9 years, 60 cm, 11 kg\n   - Gwen: 8 years, 70 cm, 15 kg\n\n2. **Add James:**\n   - James: 12 years, 90 cm, 12 kg\n\n3. **Remove Bernard:**\n   - Bernard is removed from the table.\n\n4. **Calculate the Cumulated Weight:**\n   - Remaining Penguins: Louis, Vincent, Gwen, James\n   - Weights: 11 kg (Louis) + 11 kg (Vincent) + 15 kg (Gwen) + 12 kg (James)\n\nLet's calculate the total weight:\n\n```python\n# Weights of the remaining penguins\nweights = [11, 11, 15, 12]\n\n# Calculate the total weight\ntotal_weight = sum(weights)\n\n# Output the total weight\nprint(total_weight)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the total weight of the penguins.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total weight of the penguins is 49 kg. This matches one of the options provided in the problem statement.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n\n- Louis: 11 kg\n- Vincent: 11 kg\n- Gwen: 15 kg\n- James: 12 kg\n\nAdding these weights together:  \n11 + 11 + 15 + 12 = 49 kg\n\nThis confirms that the calculation is correct. Therefore, the cumulated weight of the penguins is 49 kg.\n\n<<<answer>>>B"
