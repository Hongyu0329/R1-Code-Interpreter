    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which penguin is two years younger than Vincent. \n\nFirst, let's identify Vincent's age from the table:\n- Vincent is 9 years old.\n\nNow, we need to find a penguin who is 2 years younger than Vincent:\n- 9 years (Vincent's age) - 2 years = 7 years.\n\nNext, we check the ages of the other penguins to find who is 7 years old:\n- Louis is 7 years old.\n- Bernard is 5 years old.\n- Gwen is 8 years old.\n\nFrom this, we can see that Louis is the penguin who is 7 years old, which is 2 years younger than Vincent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Louis.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
