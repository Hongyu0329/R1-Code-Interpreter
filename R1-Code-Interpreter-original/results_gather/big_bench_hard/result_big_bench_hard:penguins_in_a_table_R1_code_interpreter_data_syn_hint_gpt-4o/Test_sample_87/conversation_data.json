    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old after removing Bernard from the table.\n\nLet's first list the penguins and their ages:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Bernard: 5 years old (to be removed)\n3. Vincent: 9 years old\n4. Gwen: 8 years old\n\nAfter removing Bernard, we have the following penguins:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Vincent: 9 years old\n3. Gwen: 8 years old\n\nNow, we count how many of these penguins are more than 5 years old:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is more than 5.\n\nAll three remaining penguins are more than 5 years old.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins more than 5 years old is 3.\n\nThe correct option is (C) 3.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
