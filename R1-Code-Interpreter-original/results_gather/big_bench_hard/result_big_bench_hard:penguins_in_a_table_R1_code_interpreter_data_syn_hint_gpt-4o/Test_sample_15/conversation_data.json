    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data about the penguins and apply the specified modifications (adding and deleting penguins) to determine how many penguins meet the criteria of being more than 5 years old and weighing more than 12 kg.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Data:**\n   - Louis: Age 7, Height 50 cm, Weight 11 kg\n   - Bernard: Age 5, Height 80 cm, Weight 13 kg\n   - Vincent: Age 9, Height 60 cm, Weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: Age 8, Height 70 cm, Weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Add a Penguin:**\n   - James: Age 12, Height 90 cm, Weight 12 kg\n\n3. **Delete Bernard:**\n   - After deleting Bernard, the list of penguins is:\n     - Louis: Age 7, Weight 11 kg\n     - Vincent: Age 9, Weight 11 kg\n     - Gwen: Age 8, Weight 15 kg\n     - James: Age 12, Weight 12 kg\n\n4. **Criteria Check:**\n   - We need to find penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.\n\nLet's evaluate each penguin:\n- **Louis:** Age 7 (>5), Weight 11 (not >12) - Does not meet criteria\n- **Vincent:** Age 9 (>5), Weight 11 (not >12) - Does not meet criteria\n- **Gwen:** Age 8 (>5), Weight 15 (>12) - Meets criteria\n- **James:** Age 12 (>5), Weight 12 (not >12) - Does not meet criteria\n\nOnly Gwen meets both criteria.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg is 1.\n\n<<<'A'>>>"
