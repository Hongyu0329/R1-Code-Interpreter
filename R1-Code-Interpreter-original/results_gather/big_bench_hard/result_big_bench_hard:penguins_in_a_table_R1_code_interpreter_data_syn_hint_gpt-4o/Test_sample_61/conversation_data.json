    "To find the cumulated age of the penguins, we need to sum the ages of all the penguins listed in the table. Let's break down the information given:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old.\n- Bernard is 5 years old.\n- Vincent is 9 years old.\n- Gwen is 8 years old.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total age by adding these values together:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Age} = 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 \\]\n\nLet's compute this sum using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the ages of the penguins\nages = [7, 5, 9, 8]\n\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_age = sum(ages)\n\n# Print the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the total age of the penguins.",
    "The code execution result shows that the total age of the penguins is 29. This matches one of the options provided in the question. Therefore, the cumulated age of the penguins is 29.\n\nThe correct option is (B) 29.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
