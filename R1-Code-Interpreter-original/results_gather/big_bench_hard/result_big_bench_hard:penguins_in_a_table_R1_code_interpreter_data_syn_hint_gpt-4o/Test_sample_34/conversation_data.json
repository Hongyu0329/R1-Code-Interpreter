  "response_list": [
    "To determine how many species are listed in the table, we need to analyze the information provided. The table lists penguins with their respective names, ages, heights, and weights. However, the table does not provide any information about the species of the penguins. All the penguins are simply listed by their names and physical attributes.\n\nSince there is no mention of different species or any indication that the penguins belong to different species, we can infer that all the penguins listed are of the same species. Therefore, the number of species listed in the table is 1.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) 1"
