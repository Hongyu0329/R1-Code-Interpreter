    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins in the table are less than 10 years old. Let's list the penguins and their ages:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Bernard: 5 years old\n3. Vincent: 9 years old\n4. Gwen: 8 years old\n5. James: 12 years old\n\nNow, we count the number of penguins whose ages are less than 10:\n\n- Louis (7 years old) is less than 10.\n- Bernard (5 years old) is less than 10.\n- Vincent (9 years old) is less than 10.\n- Gwen (8 years old) is less than 10.\n- James (12 years old) is not less than 10.\n\nThere are 4 penguins who are less than 10 years old.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) 4.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
