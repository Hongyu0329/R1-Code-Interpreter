    "To determine the second heaviest penguin, we need to compare the weights of the penguins listed in the table. Let's extract the relevant information:\n\n- Louis: 11 kg\n- Bernard: 13 kg\n- Vincent: 11 kg\n- Gwen: 15 kg\n\nWe need to sort these weights in descending order to find the second heaviest penguin. The sorted order of weights is: 15 kg, 13 kg, 11 kg, 11 kg. The second heaviest weight is 13 kg, which belongs to Bernard.\n\nTherefore, the second heaviest penguin is Bernard.\n\n<<<B) Bernard>>>"
