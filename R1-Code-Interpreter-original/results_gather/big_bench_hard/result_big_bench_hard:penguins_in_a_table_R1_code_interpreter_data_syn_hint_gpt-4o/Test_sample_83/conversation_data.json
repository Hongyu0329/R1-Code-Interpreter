    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data about the penguins and apply the conditions specified in the question. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Data**: We have the following penguins with their respective attributes:\n   - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Remove Bernard**: According to the problem, Bernard is removed from the table. So, we are left with:\n   - Louis: age 7, weight 11 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, weight 15 kg\n\n3. **Apply Conditions**: We need to find penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.\n   - Louis: age 7 (>5), weight 11 kg (<12) - Satisfies both conditions\n   - Vincent: age 9 (>5), weight 11 kg (<12) - Satisfies both conditions\n   - Gwen: age 8 (>5), weight 15 kg (not <12) - Does not satisfy the weight condition\n\n4. **Count the Penguins**: From the above analysis, Louis and Vincent satisfy both conditions.\n\nThus, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 2.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
