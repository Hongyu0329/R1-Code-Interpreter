    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data about the penguins and determine how many of them are more than 8 years old after removing Bernard from the list.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Bernard: 5 years old (to be removed)\n3. Vincent: 9 years old\n4. Gwen: 8 years old\n\nAfter removing Bernard, we have the following penguins:\n\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\nNow, we need to count how many of these penguins are more than 8 years old:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is not more than 8.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 8.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is not more than 8.\n\nTherefore, only Vincent is more than 8 years old.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 1.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
