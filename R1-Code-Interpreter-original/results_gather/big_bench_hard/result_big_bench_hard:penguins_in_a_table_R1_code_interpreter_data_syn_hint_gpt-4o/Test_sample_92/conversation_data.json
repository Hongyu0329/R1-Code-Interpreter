    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data about the penguins and apply the conditions specified in the question. The conditions are:\n\n1. The penguin must be less than 8 years old.\n2. The penguin must weigh more than 12 kg.\n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n- Louis: age 7, weight 11 kg\n- Bernard: age 5, weight 13 kg\n- Vincent: age 9, weight 11 kg\n- Gwen: age 8, weight 15 kg\n\nNow, let's apply the conditions to each penguin:\n\n1. **Louis**: \n   - Age: 7 (less than 8)\n   - Weight: 11 kg (not more than 12 kg)\n   - Does not satisfy both conditions.\n\n2. **Bernard**: \n   - Age: 5 (less than 8)\n   - Weight: 13 kg (more than 12 kg)\n   - Satisfies both conditions.\n\n3. **Vincent**: \n   - Age: 9 (not less than 8)\n   - Weight: 11 kg (not more than 12 kg)\n   - Does not satisfy both conditions.\n\n4. **Gwen**: \n   - Age: 8 (not less than 8)\n   - Weight: 15 kg (more than 12 kg)\n   - Does not satisfy both conditions.\n\nFrom the analysis, only Bernard satisfies both conditions. Therefore, there is only 1 penguin that meets the criteria.\n\nThe answer is (A) 1.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
