    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of animals (both penguins and giraffes) that are more than 5 years old. We will go through each list and count the animals that meet this criterion.\n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n**Penguins:**\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\n**Giraffes:**\n- Jody: 5 years old\n- Gladys: 10 years old\n- Marian: 2 years old\n- Donna: 9 years old\n\nNow, let's count the animals that are more than 5 years old:\n\n- Penguins: Louis (7), Vincent (9), Gwen (8) → 3 penguins\n- Giraffes: Gladys (10), Donna (9) → 2 giraffes\n\nTotal animals more than 5 years old = 3 (penguins) + 2 (giraffes) = 5 animals.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) 5.\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) 5"
