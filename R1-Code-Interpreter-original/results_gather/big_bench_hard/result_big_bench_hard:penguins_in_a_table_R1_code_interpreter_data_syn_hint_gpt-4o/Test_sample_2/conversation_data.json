    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old based on the given data. Let's analyze the ages of each penguin:\n\n1. Louis is 7 years old.\n2. Bernard is 5 years old.\n3. Vincent is 9 years old.\n4. Gwen is 8 years old.\n\nNow, we count the number of penguins whose age is greater than 5:\n\n- Louis (7 years old) is more than 5 years old.\n- Bernard (5 years old) is not more than 5 years old.\n- Vincent (9 years old) is more than 5 years old.\n- Gwen (8 years old) is more than 5 years old.\n\nThus, there are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old.\n\nThe correct option is (C) 3.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
