    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins in the table are more than 5 years old. Let's list the penguins and their ages:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Bernard: 5 years old\n3. Vincent: 9 years old\n4. Gwen: 8 years old\n5. James: 12 years old\n\nNow, we count the number of penguins whose age is greater than 5:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Bernard is 5 years old, which is not more than 5.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 5.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is more than 5.\n- James is 12 years old, which is more than 5.\n\nThus, there are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old.\n\nThe correct option is (D) 4.\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) 4"
