    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins in the table are more than 8 years old. Let's list the penguins and their ages:\n\n1. Louis: 7 years old\n2. Bernard: 5 years old\n3. Vincent: 9 years old\n4. Gwen: 8 years old\n5. James: 12 years old\n\nNow, we identify which penguins are older than 8 years:\n\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 8.\n- James is 12 years old, which is more than 8.\n\nThus, there are 2 penguins who are more than 8 years old.\n\nThe correct option is (B) 2.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
