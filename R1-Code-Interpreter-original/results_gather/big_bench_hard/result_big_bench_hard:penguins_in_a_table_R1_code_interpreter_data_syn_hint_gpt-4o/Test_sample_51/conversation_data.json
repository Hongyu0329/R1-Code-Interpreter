    "To determine the shortest penguin, we need to compare the heights of each penguin listed in the table. Let's extract the relevant information:\n\n- Louis: 50 cm\n- Bernard: 80 cm\n- Vincent: 60 cm\n- Gwen: 70 cm\n\nWe need to identify the penguin with the smallest height value.\n\n1. Louis has a height of 50 cm.\n2. Bernard has a height of 80 cm.\n3. Vincent has a height of 60 cm.\n4. Gwen has a height of 70 cm.\n\nBy comparing these heights, we can see that Louis, with a height of 50 cm, is the shortest penguin.\n\nJames is not listed in the table, so we can disregard option (E).\n\nTherefore, the shortest penguin is Louis.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
