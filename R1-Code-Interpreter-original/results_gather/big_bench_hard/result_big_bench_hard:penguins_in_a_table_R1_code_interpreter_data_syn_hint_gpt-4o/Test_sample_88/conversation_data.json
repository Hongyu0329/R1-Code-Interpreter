    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the table of penguins and their attributes. Initially, we have the following penguins:\n\n1. Louis: age 7\n2. Bernard: age 5\n3. Vincent: age 9\n4. Gwen: age 8\n\nWe then add a new penguin:\n\n5. James: age 12\n\nAfter adding James, we delete Bernard from the table. The updated list of penguins is:\n\n1. Louis: age 7\n2. Vincent: age 9\n3. Gwen: age 8\n4. James: age 12\n\nNow, we need to count how many penguins are more than 8 years old. Let's evaluate each penguin:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old, which is not more than 8.\n- Vincent is 9 years old, which is more than 8.\n- Gwen is 8 years old, which is not more than 8.\n- James is 12 years old, which is more than 8.\n\nFrom this evaluation, we find that Vincent and James are more than 8 years old. Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 8 years old.\n\nThe correct option is (B) 2.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) 2"
