    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are less than 10 years old based on the given data. Let's analyze the ages of each penguin:\n\n1. Louis is 7 years old.\n2. Bernard is 5 years old.\n3. Vincent is 9 years old.\n4. Gwen is 8 years old.\n\nNow, we count the number of penguins whose ages are less than 10:\n\n- Louis (7 years old) is less than 10.\n- Bernard (5 years old) is less than 10.\n- Vincent (9 years old) is less than 10.\n- Gwen (8 years old) is less than 10.\n\nAll four penguins are less than 10 years old. Therefore, the number of penguins less than 10 years old is 4.\n\nThe correct option is (D) 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
