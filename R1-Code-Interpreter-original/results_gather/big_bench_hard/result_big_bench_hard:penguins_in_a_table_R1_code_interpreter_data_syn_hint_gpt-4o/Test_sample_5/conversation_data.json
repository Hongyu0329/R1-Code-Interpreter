  "question": "Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nJody, 5, 430, 620\nGladys, 10, 420, 590\nMarian, 2, 310, 410\nDonna, 9, 440, 650\nWhat is the cumulated age of the giraffes?\nOptions:\n(A) 26\n(B) 29\n(C) 41\n(D) 55\n(E) 67\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
  "response_list": [
    "To find the cumulated age of the giraffes, we need to sum up the ages of all the giraffes listed in the table. The ages of the giraffes are as follows:\n\n- Jody: 5 years\n- Gladys: 10 years\n- Marian: 2 years\n- Donna: 9 years\n\nLet's calculate the total age by adding these values together.\n\n```python\n# Ages of the giraffes\nages = [5, 10, 2, 9]\n\n# Calculate the cumulated age\ncumulated_age = sum(ages)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(cumulated_age)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the cumulated age of the giraffes.",
    "The code execution result shows that the cumulated age of the giraffes is 26. This matches one of the options provided in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (A) 26"
