    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the table of penguins and determine how many of them are less than 8 years old after the specified modifications.\n\nInitially, the table is as follows:\n\n1. Louis, 7, 50, 11\n2. Bernard, 5, 80, 13\n3. Vincent, 9, 60, 11\n4. Gwen, 8, 70, 15\n\nWe then add a new penguin:\n\n5. James, 12, 90, 12\n\nAfter adding James, we delete Bernard from the table. The updated table is:\n\n1. Louis, 7, 50, 11\n2. Vincent, 9, 60, 11\n3. Gwen, 8, 70, 15\n4. James, 12, 90, 12\n\nNow, we need to count the penguins who are less than 8 years old:\n\n- Louis is 7 years old.\n- Vincent is 9 years old.\n- Gwen is 8 years old.\n- James is 12 years old.\n\nOnly Louis is less than 8 years old.\n\nTherefore, the number of penguins less than 8 years old is 1.\n\nThe correct option is (A) 1.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
