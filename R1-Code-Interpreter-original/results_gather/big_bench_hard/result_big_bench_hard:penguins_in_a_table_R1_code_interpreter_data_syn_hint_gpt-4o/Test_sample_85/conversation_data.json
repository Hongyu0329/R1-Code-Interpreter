    "To solve this problem, we need to update the table of penguins by adding James and removing Bernard. Then, we will identify the penguin with a height of 60 cm.\n\nInitially, the table is as follows:\n\n| Name    | Age | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |\n|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|\n| Louis   | 7   | 50          | 11          |\n| Bernard | 5   | 80          | 13          |\n| Vincent | 9   | 60          | 11          |\n| Gwen    | 8   | 70          | 15          |\n\nAfter adding James and removing Bernard, the updated table is:\n\n| Name    | Age | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) |\n|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|\n| Louis   | 7   | 50          | 11          |\n| Vincent | 9   | 60          | 11          |\n| Gwen    | 8   | 70          | 15          |\n| James   | 12  | 90          | 12          |\n\nNow, we need to find the penguin with a height of 60 cm. From the updated table, we can see that Vincent is the penguin with a height of 60 cm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> Vincent"
