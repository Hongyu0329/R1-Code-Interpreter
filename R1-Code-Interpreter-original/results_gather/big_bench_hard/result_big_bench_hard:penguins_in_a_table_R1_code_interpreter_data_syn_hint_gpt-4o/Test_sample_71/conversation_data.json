    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the ages of the penguins mentioned in the table. We are looking for a penguin whose age is less than Vincent's age and greater than Louis's age.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Louis is 7 years old.\n- Bernard is 5 years old.\n- Vincent is 9 years old.\n- Gwen is 8 years old.\n\nWe need to find a penguin whose age is greater than 7 (Louis's age) and less than 9 (Vincent's age).\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- (A) Louis: 7 years old, not greater than 7.\n- (B) Bernard: 5 years old, not greater than 7.\n- (C) Vincent: 9 years old, not less than 9.\n- (D) Gwen: 8 years old, which is greater than 7 and less than 9.\n- (E) James: Not mentioned in the table, so we cannot consider this option.\n\nThe only penguin that fits the criteria is Gwen.\n\n<<<D>>>"
