    "To determine the oldest penguin, we need to analyze the ages of the penguins in the updated table after adding James and removing Bernard.\n\nInitially, the table is as follows:\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Bernard: 5 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n\nAfter adding James and removing Bernard, the table becomes:\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n- James: 12 years old\n\nNow, we compare the ages of the remaining penguins:\n- Louis: 7 years old\n- Vincent: 9 years old\n- Gwen: 8 years old\n- James: 12 years old\n\nJames is the oldest penguin at 12 years old.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) James.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
