    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given data about the penguins and apply the conditions specified in the question. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Data**: We have the following penguins with their respective attributes:\n   - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Bernard: age 5, height 80 cm, weight 13 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n2. **Remove Bernard**: According to the problem, Bernard is removed from the table. So, we are left with:\n   - Louis: age 7, height 50 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Vincent: age 9, height 60 cm, weight 11 kg\n   - Gwen: age 8, height 70 cm, weight 15 kg\n\n3. **Apply Conditions**: We need to find penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.\n   - Louis: age 7 (more than 5), weight 11 kg (not more than 12 kg) - Does not satisfy both conditions.\n   - Vincent: age 9 (more than 5), weight 11 kg (not more than 12 kg) - Does not satisfy both conditions.\n   - Gwen: age 8 (more than 5), weight 15 kg (more than 12 kg) - Satisfies both conditions.\n\n4. **Count the Penguins**: Only Gwen satisfies both conditions.\n\nThus, there is only 1 penguin that meets the criteria.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
