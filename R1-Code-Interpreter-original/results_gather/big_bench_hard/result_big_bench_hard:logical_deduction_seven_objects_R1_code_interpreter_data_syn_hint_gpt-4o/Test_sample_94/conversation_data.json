    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the golfers based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Rob finished second.\n2. Rob finished above Eve.\n3. Joe finished above Ada.\n4. Joe finished below Eve.\n5. Ada finished above Ana.\n6. Eli finished third-to-last.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From condition 1, we know Rob is in the 2nd position.\n- From condition 2, Eve must be below Rob, so Eve cannot be 1st.\n- From condition 3, Joe is above Ada.\n- From condition 4, Joe is below Eve, so Eve must be above Joe.\n- From condition 5, Ada is above Ana.\n- From condition 6, Eli is third-to-last, which is the 5th position.\n\nNow, let's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n1. Since Rob is 2nd, the 1st position must be filled by someone else. Eve cannot be 1st because she is below Rob. Joe cannot be 1st because he is below Eve. Ada and Ana cannot be 1st because they are below Joe. Therefore, Amy must be 1st.\n\n2. Rob is 2nd.\n\n3. Eli is 5th.\n\n4. Joe is below Eve, and above Ada, so Joe can be 4th, and Eve can be 3rd.\n\n5. Ada is above Ana, so Ada can be 6th, and Ana can be 7th.\n\nThe order is: Amy, Rob, Eve, Joe, Eli, Ada, Ana.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) Ada finished second - False\n(B) Amy finished second - False\n(C) Eli finished second - False\n(D) Rob finished second - True\n(E) Joe finished second - False\n(F) Eve finished second - False\n(G) Ana finished second - False\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Rob finished second.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
