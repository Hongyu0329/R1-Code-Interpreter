    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the information:\n\n1. The pears are the third-cheapest.\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n3. The pears are more expensive than the plums.\n4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n6. The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since the pears are the third-cheapest, there are two fruits cheaper than pears.\n- The kiwis are the second-most expensive, so there is only one fruit more expensive than kiwis.\n- The mangoes are the third-most expensive, so there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n- The peaches are the second-cheapest, which means there is only one fruit cheaper than peaches.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits based on the given information:\n\n1. Cheapest: ?\n2. Second-cheapest: Peaches\n3. Third-cheapest: Pears\n4. Fourth-cheapest: Plums (since pears are more expensive than plums)\n5. Third-most expensive: Mangoes\n6. Second-most expensive: Kiwis\n7. Most expensive: ?\n\nNow, we need to fill in the remaining positions:\n\n- Since oranges are less expensive than kiwis, they cannot be in the second-most expensive position. They must be cheaper than kiwis.\n- The only position left for oranges is the first position (cheapest) or the fifth position (fourth-cheapest).\n\nGiven the options, the only fruit that matches the second-cheapest position is the peaches.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> F"
