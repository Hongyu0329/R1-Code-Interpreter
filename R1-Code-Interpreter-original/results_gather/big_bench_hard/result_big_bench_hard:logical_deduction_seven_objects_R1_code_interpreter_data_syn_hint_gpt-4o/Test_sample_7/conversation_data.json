    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues:\n\n1. Peaches are the cheapest.\n2. Apples are the second-cheapest.\n3. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n4. Plums are the fourth-most expensive.\n5. Kiwis are more expensive than mangoes.\n6. Oranges are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since peaches are the cheapest, they are in the first position.\n- Apples are the second-cheapest, so they are in the second position.\n- Loquats are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- Plums are the fourth-most expensive, which means they are in the fourth position.\n- Kiwis are more expensive than mangoes, so kiwis must be in a position after mangoes.\n- Oranges are less expensive than mangoes, so oranges must be in a position before mangoes.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the remaining fruits (oranges, mangoes, kiwis) in the remaining positions (fifth, sixth, and seventh):\n\n- Since oranges are less expensive than mangoes, oranges must be in the fifth position, and mangoes must be in the sixth position.\n- This leaves kiwis to be in the seventh position, as they are more expensive than mangoes.\n\nThe order based on price from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Peaches\n2. Apples\n3. Loquats\n4. Plums\n5. Oranges\n6. Mangoes\n7. Kiwis\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The oranges are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, oranges are fifth.\n(B) The loquats are the third-cheapest - Correct, loquats are third.\n(C) The apples are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, apples are second.\n(D) The kiwis are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, kiwis are seventh.\n(E) The mangoes are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, mangoes are sixth.\n(F) The plums are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, plums are fourth.\n(G) The peaches are the third-cheapest - Incorrect, peaches are first.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The loquats are the third-cheapest"
