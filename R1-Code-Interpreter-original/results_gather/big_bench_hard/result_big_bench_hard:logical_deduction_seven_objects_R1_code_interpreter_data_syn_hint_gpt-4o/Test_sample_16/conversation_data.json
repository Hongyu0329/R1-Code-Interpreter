    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n3. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n4. Loquats are less expensive than kiwis.\n5. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n6. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n7. Plums are the cheapest.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since plums are the cheapest, they are in the 7th position.\n- Loquats are the third-cheapest, so they are in the 5th position.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in the 2nd position.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats but less expensive than cantaloupes, so apples are in the 4th position.\n- Loquats are less expensive than kiwis, so kiwis must be more expensive than loquats.\n- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, the most expensive fruit must be either kiwis, cantaloupes, or pears.\n\nNow, let's arrange the fruits based on the information:\n\n1. Most expensive: ?\n2. Watermelons\n3. ?\n4. Apples\n5. Loquats\n6. ?\n7. Plums\n\nSince watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes, cantaloupes cannot be the most expensive. Therefore, the most expensive fruit must be kiwis or pears.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\n(A) The plums are the most expensive - Incorrect, as plums are the cheapest.\n(B) The kiwis are the most expensive - Possible.\n(C) The cantaloupes are the most expensive - Incorrect, as watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n(D) The pears are the most expensive - Possible.\n(E) The watermelons are the most expensive - Incorrect, as they are the second-most expensive.\n(F) The apples are the most expensive - Incorrect, as they are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n(G) The loquats are the most expensive - Incorrect, as they are the third-cheapest.\n\nSince the only possibilities for the most expensive fruit are kiwis or pears, and we have no information to distinguish between them, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(B) The kiwis are the most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
