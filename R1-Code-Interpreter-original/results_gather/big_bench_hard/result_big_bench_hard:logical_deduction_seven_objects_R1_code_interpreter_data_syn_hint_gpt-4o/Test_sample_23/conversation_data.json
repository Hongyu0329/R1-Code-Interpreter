    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Mangoes are the cheapest.**  \n   This means mangoes are in position 7 (if we consider 1 as the most expensive and 7 as the least expensive).\n\n2. **Kiwis are the third-cheapest.**  \n   This means kiwis are in position 5.\n\n3. **Peaches are the second-most expensive.**  \n   This means peaches are in position 2.\n\n4. **Cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive.**  \n   This means cantaloupes are in position 4.\n\n5. **Pears are less expensive than cantaloupes.**  \n   Since cantaloupes are in position 4, pears must be in position 5, 6, or 7. But since kiwis are in position 5 and mangoes are in position 7, pears must be in position 6.\n\n6. **Oranges are more expensive than peaches.**  \n   Since peaches are in position 2, oranges must be in position 1.\n\nNow, let's summarize the positions:\n- 1st: Oranges\n- 2nd: Peaches\n- 3rd: (unknown)\n- 4th: Cantaloupes\n- 5th: Kiwis\n- 6th: Pears\n- 7th: Mangoes\n\nThe only position left is the 3rd, which must be occupied by watermelons.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n- (A) The watermelons are the fourth-most expensive: Incorrect, they are third.\n- (B) The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive: Incorrect, they are seventh.\n- (C) The kiwis are the fourth-most expensive: Incorrect, they are fifth.\n- (D) The pears are the fourth-most expensive: Incorrect, they are sixth.\n- (E) The cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive: Correct.\n- (F) The oranges are the fourth-most expensive: Incorrect, they are first.\n- (G) The peaches are the fourth-most expensive: Incorrect, they are second.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
