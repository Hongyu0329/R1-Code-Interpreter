    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions and determine which bird is the rightmost.\n\nLet's list the conditions:\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.\n2. The quail is to the right of the crow.\n3. The raven is to the left of the robin.\n4. The blue jay is the third from the right.\n5. The cardinal is the leftmost.\n6. The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n1. The cardinal is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n2. The hummingbird is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n3. The blue jay is third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n4. The hummingbird is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n5. The quail is to the right of the crow, so the crow cannot be in position 7.\n6. The raven is to the left of the robin.\n\nLet's place the birds step by step:\n\n- Position 1: Cardinal\n- Position 4: Hummingbird\n- Position 5: Blue Jay\n\nNow, we need to place the crow, quail, raven, and robin.\n\nSince the crow cannot be in position 7, it can be in position 6. The quail, which is to the right of the crow, must be in position 7.\n\n- Position 6: Crow\n- Position 7: Quail\n\nNow, we have positions 2 and 3 left for the raven and robin. Since the raven is to the left of the robin, the raven must be in position 2 and the robin in position 3.\n\n- Position 2: Raven\n- Position 3: Robin\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1. Cardinal\n2. Raven\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Blue Jay\n6. Crow\n7. Quail\n\nThe rightmost bird is the quail.\n\n<<<answer>>>E"
