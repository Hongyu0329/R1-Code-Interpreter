    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. The loquats are less expensive than the oranges.\n2. The oranges are the third-most expensive.\n3. The apples are the cheapest.\n4. The kiwis are more expensive than the pears.\n5. The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons.\n6. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that apples are the cheapest. Therefore, option (E) is correct. Let's verify this by checking the consistency of the other statements:\n\n- Since apples are the cheapest, they are in the 7th position.\n- Oranges are the third-most expensive, so they are in the 3rd position.\n- Loquats are less expensive than oranges, so they must be in the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th position. However, since loquats are more expensive than kiwis, they cannot be in the 7th position. Therefore, loquats are in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.\n- Kiwis are more expensive than pears, so kiwis cannot be in the 7th position. Therefore, pears are in the 6th or 7th position.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than watermelons, so mangoes cannot be in the 7th position.\n\nGiven that apples are the cheapest, the only consistent option is (E).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
