    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and determine which book is the rightmost.\n\n1. We have seven books: brown, yellow, black, white, green, orange, and purple.\n2. The purple book is the rightmost.\n3. The yellow book is the leftmost.\n4. The orange book is the second from the right.\n5. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n6. The brown book is to the left of the green book.\n7. The brown book is to the right of the black book.\n\nLet's arrange the books step by step:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n- The purple book is the rightmost, so it is in position 7.\n- The orange book is second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- The white book is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n\nNow, the arrangement looks like this:\n1. Yellow\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. White\n5. ?\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNext, we know:\n- The brown book is to the left of the green book.\n- The brown book is to the right of the black book.\n\nSince the brown book must be to the right of the black book, and both must fit in the remaining positions (2, 3, 5), we can deduce:\n- Black must be in position 2.\n- Brown must be in position 3.\n- Green must be in position 5.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1. Yellow\n2. Black\n3. Brown\n4. White\n5. Green\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nThe rightmost book is the purple book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The purple book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
