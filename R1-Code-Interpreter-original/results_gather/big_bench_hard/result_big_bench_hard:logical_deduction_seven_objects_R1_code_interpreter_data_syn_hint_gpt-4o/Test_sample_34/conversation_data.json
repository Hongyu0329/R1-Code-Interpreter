    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The pears are the third-cheapest.\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n3. The pears are more expensive than the plums.\n4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n6. The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nFrom these clues, we can start arranging the fruits:\n\n- Since the peaches are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- The pears are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- The plums must be cheaper than the pears, so they are in position 1.\n- The kiwis are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- The mangoes are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n- The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis, so they must be in position 4.\n- The only fruit left is the watermelons, which must be the most expensive, in position 7.\n\nNow, let's list the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Plums\n2. Peaches\n3. Pears\n4. Oranges\n5. Mangoes\n6. Kiwis\n7. Watermelons\n\nAccording to this order, the fruit that is the fourth-most expensive is the oranges.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The oranges are the fourth-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>> G"
