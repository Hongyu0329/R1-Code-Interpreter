    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n2. The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n3. The plums are more expensive than the mangoes.\n4. The plums are less expensive than the peaches.\n5. The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\n6. The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats.\n\nGiven these clues, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since the loquats are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, which means they are in position 4.\n- The plums are more expensive than the mangoes, so they must be in position 5 or higher.\n- The plums are less expensive than the peaches, so the peaches must be in position 6 or 7.\n- The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes, so the cantaloupes must be in position 7.\n- The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats, so they must be in position 3 or higher.\n\nLet's try to fill in the positions:\n\n1. Cheapest: Apples (since loquats are second-cheapest and mangoes are fourth)\n2. Second-cheapest: Loquats\n3. Third-cheapest: Watermelons (since they are more expensive than loquats)\n4. Fourth-most expensive: Mangoes\n5. Fifth: Plums (since they are more expensive than mangoes and less than peaches)\n6. Sixth: Peaches (since they are less expensive than cantaloupes)\n7. Most expensive: Cantaloupes\n\nNow, we can see that the third-cheapest fruit is the watermelons.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(F) The watermelons are the third-cheapest\n\n<<<answer>>>"
