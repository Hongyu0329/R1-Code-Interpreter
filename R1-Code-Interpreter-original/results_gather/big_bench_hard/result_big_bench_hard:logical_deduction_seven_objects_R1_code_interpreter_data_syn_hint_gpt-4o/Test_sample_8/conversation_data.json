    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n2. The tractor is the fourth-newest, which means it is the fourth from the end, or equivalently, the fourth-oldest.\n3. The minivan is older than the truck.\n4. The truck is older than the limousine.\n5. The hatchback is the third-oldest.\n6. The bus is newer than the limousine.\n\nLet's arrange the vehicles based on these clues:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it occupies the second position.\n- The hatchback is the third-oldest, so it occupies the third position.\n- The tractor is the fourth-oldest, so it occupies the fourth position.\n\nNow, we have the following partial order:\n1. ?\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Tractor\n5. ?\n6. ?\n7. ?\n\nNext, we know:\n- The minivan is older than the truck, and the truck is older than the limousine. Therefore, the order among these three is: Minivan > Truck > Limousine.\n- The bus is newer than the limousine, so the bus must be in the seventh position.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining positions:\n- The minivan must be the oldest because it is older than the truck and limousine, and the only available position for it is the first.\n- The truck must be in the fifth position because it is older than the limousine.\n- The limousine must be in the sixth position because it is older than the bus.\n\nThe final order from oldest to newest is:\n1. Minivan\n2. Convertible\n3. Hatchback\n4. Tractor\n5. Truck\n6. Limousine\n7. Bus\n\nTherefore, the minivan is the oldest.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) The minivan is the oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
