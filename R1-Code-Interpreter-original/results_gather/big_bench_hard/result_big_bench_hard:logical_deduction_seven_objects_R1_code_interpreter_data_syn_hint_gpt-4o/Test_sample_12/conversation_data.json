    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Eve finished above Amy.\n2. Dan finished second.\n3. Ada finished below Ana.\n4. Ana finished third-to-last.\n5. Mel finished last.\n6. Amy finished third.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n- Since Dan finished second, the second position is occupied by Dan.\n- Amy finished third, so the third position is occupied by Amy.\n- Ana finished third-to-last, which means Ana is in the fifth position.\n- Mel finished last, so Mel is in the seventh position.\n- Eve finished above Amy, so Eve must be in the first position because the second and third positions are already occupied by Dan and Amy, respectively.\n- Ada finished below Ana, so Ada must be in the sixth position because the fifth position is occupied by Ana.\n- The only position left is the fourth position, which must be occupied by Joe.\n\nThus, the order from first to last is: Eve, Dan, Amy, Joe, Ana, Ada, Mel.\n\nNow, let's check the options to see who finished last:\n\n(A) Joe finished last - Incorrect, Joe finished fourth.\n(B) Dan finished last - Incorrect, Dan finished second.\n(C) Ana finished last - Incorrect, Ana finished fifth.\n(D) Mel finished last - Correct, Mel finished seventh.\n(E) Ada finished last - Incorrect, Ada finished sixth.\n(F) Eve finished last - Incorrect, Eve finished first.\n(G) Amy finished last - Incorrect, Amy finished third.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Mel finished last.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
