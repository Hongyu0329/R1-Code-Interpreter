    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the golfers based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Ada finished above Rob.\n2. Eve finished below Rob.\n3. Mel finished above Eli.\n4. Ada finished below Dan.\n5. Ana finished third.\n6. Eli finished second.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since Eli finished second, the order is: _ , Eli, _ , _ , _ , _ , _.\n- Ana finished third, so the order is: _ , Eli, Ana, _ , _ , _ , _.\n- Mel finished above Eli, so Mel must be first. The order is: Mel, Eli, Ana, _ , _ , _ , _.\n- Ada finished below Dan, so Dan must be fourth. The order is: Mel, Eli, Ana, Dan, _ , _ , _.\n- Ada finished above Rob, and Eve finished below Rob. Therefore, the only positions left for Ada, Rob, and Eve are fifth, sixth, and seventh. Since Ada is above Rob, and Rob is above Eve, the order is: Mel, Eli, Ana, Dan, Ada, Rob, Eve.\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- Ada finished above Rob: Ada (5th) is above Rob (6th).\n- Eve finished below Rob: Eve (7th) is below Rob (6th).\n- Mel finished above Eli: Mel (1st) is above Eli (2nd).\n- Ada finished below Dan: Ada (5th) is below Dan (4th).\n- Ana finished third: Ana is indeed 3rd.\n- Eli finished second: Eli is indeed 2nd.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Now, we need to determine who finished third. According to the order, Ana finished third.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) Ana finished third.\n\n<<<answer>>> (E) Ana finished third"
