    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest.**\n   - This means there are three vehicles newer than the station wagon and three vehicles older than it.\n\n2. **The motorcycle is newer than the truck.**\n   - This implies the truck is older than the motorcycle.\n\n3. **The station wagon is older than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon.\n\n4. **The minivan is newer than the hatchback.**\n   - This means the hatchback is older than the minivan.\n\n5. **The bus is newer than the minivan.**\n   - This means the minivan is older than the bus.\n\n6. **The truck is newer than the limousine.**\n   - This implies the limousine is older than the truck.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these clues:\n\n- Since the station wagon is the fourth-newest, it is in the middle position: 4th.\n- The hatchback is newer than the station wagon, so it must be in the 5th, 6th, or 7th position.\n- The minivan is newer than the hatchback, so it must be in a position after the hatchback.\n- The bus is newer than the minivan, so it must be in a position after the minivan.\n- The motorcycle is newer than the truck, so the truck must be in a position before the motorcycle.\n- The truck is newer than the limousine, so the limousine must be in a position before the truck.\n\nLet's try to place them:\n\n1. Limousine (oldest)\n2. Truck\n3. Motorcycle\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Hatchback\n6. Minivan\n7. Bus (newest)\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n- (A) The bus is the third-oldest: Incorrect, the bus is the newest.\n- (B) The motorcycle is the third-oldest: Correct, the motorcycle is in the third position.\n- (C) The hatchback is the third-oldest: Incorrect, the hatchback is in the fifth position.\n- (D) The station wagon is the third-oldest: Incorrect, the station wagon is in the fourth position.\n- (E) The minivan is the third-oldest: Incorrect, the minivan is in the sixth position.\n- (F) The truck is the third-oldest: Incorrect, the truck is in the second position.\n- (G) The limousine is the third-oldest: Incorrect, the limousine is the oldest.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) The motorcycle is the third-oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>B"
