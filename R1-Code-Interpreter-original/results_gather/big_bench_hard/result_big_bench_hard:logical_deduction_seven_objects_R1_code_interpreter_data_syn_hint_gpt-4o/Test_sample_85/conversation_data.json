    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints in the paragraph. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Plums are the cheapest.\n2. Watermelons are the third-most expensive.\n3. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n4. Kiwis are the most expensive.\n5. Apples are less expensive than peaches.\n6. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Plums (cheapest)\n2. ?\n3. Loquats (third-cheapest)\n4. Watermelons (third-most expensive)\n5. ?\n6. ?\n7. Kiwis (most expensive)\n\nNow, let's fill in the gaps:\n\n- Since apples are more expensive than oranges, oranges must be cheaper than apples.\n- Since apples are less expensive than peaches, peaches must be more expensive than apples.\n\nConsidering these points, let's try to place the remaining fruits:\n\n1. Plums\n2. Oranges (since they are cheaper than apples)\n3. Loquats\n4. Watermelons\n5. Apples (since they are less expensive than peaches)\n6. Peaches\n7. Kiwis\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. Based on the order:\n\n1. Plums\n2. Oranges\n3. Loquats\n4. Watermelons\n5. Apples\n6. Peaches (second-most expensive)\n7. Kiwis\n\nThus, the peaches are the second-most expensive fruit.\n\nThe correct option is (G) The peaches are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
