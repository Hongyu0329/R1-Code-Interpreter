    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions and then determine which bird is third from the right.\n\nLet's list the birds and the conditions:\n\n1. Birds: raven, hummingbird, robin, crow, quail, blue jay, cardinal.\n2. Conditions:\n   - The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.\n   - The quail is to the right of the crow.\n   - The raven is to the left of the robin.\n   - The blue jay is the third from the right.\n   - The cardinal is the leftmost.\n   - The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\n\nNow, let's arrange the birds:\n\n1. The cardinal is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n2. The hummingbird is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n3. The blue jay is third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n4. The hummingbird is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n5. The quail is to the right of the crow, so the crow cannot be in position 7.\n6. The raven is to the left of the robin.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n- Position 1: Cardinal\n- Position 2: Raven (since it must be to the left of the robin)\n- Position 3: Robin (since it must be to the right of the raven)\n- Position 4: Hummingbird\n- Position 5: Blue Jay\n- Position 6: Crow (since it must be to the right of the hummingbird and to the left of the quail)\n- Position 7: Quail (since it must be to the right of the crow)\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the crow: True (Position 4 < Position 6)\n- The quail is to the right of the crow: True (Position 7 > Position 6)\n- The raven is to the left of the robin: True (Position 2 < Position 3)\n- The blue jay is the third from the right: True (Position 5)\n- The cardinal is the leftmost: True (Position 1)\n- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left: True (Position 4)\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the bird that is third from the right is the blue jay.\n\nThe correct option is (F) The blue jay is the third from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>>F"
