    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions and then determine which bird is second from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The blue jay is the leftmost.\n2. The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n3. The raven is the third from the right.\n4. The owl is the third from the left.\n5. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail.\n6. The robin is to the left of the cardinal.\n\nLet's start placing the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the blue jay is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n- The owl is the third from the left, so it occupies the third position.\n- The cardinal is the fourth from the left, so it occupies the fourth position.\n- The raven is the third from the right, which means it occupies the fifth position (since there are seven birds in total).\n- The hummingbird must be to the left of the quail, so they cannot occupy the sixth and seventh positions together.\n- The robin must be to the left of the cardinal, so it cannot be in the fifth, sixth, or seventh positions.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n1. Blue Jay (1st position)\n2. Hummingbird (2nd position, since it must be to the left of the quail)\n3. Owl (3rd position)\n4. Cardinal (4th position)\n5. Raven (5th position)\n6. Robin (6th position, since it must be to the left of the cardinal)\n7. Quail (7th position, since it must be to the right of the hummingbird)\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n- Blue Jay is the leftmost.\n- Cardinal is fourth from the left.\n- Raven is third from the right.\n- Owl is third from the left.\n- Hummingbird is to the left of the quail.\n- Robin is to the left of the cardinal.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Now, we need to determine which bird is second from the right. In this arrangement, the robin is second from the right.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The robin is the second from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
