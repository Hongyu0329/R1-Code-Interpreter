    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. The motorcycle is older than the truck.\n2. The station wagon is older than the hatchback.\n3. The motorcycle is newer than the hatchback.\n4. The bus is the second-newest.\n5. The minivan is the oldest.\n6. The limousine is older than the station wagon.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know that the minivan is the oldest. This directly eliminates options (A), (B), (C), (E), (F), and (G) because they suggest other vehicles as the oldest.\n\nNow, let's arrange the vehicles based on the remaining statements:\n\n- The minivan is the oldest.\n- The motorcycle is older than the truck, but newer than the hatchback.\n- The station wagon is older than the hatchback.\n- The limousine is older than the station wagon.\n- The bus is the second-newest.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following order:\n\n1. Minivan (oldest)\n2. Limousine (older than station wagon)\n3. Station Wagon (older than hatchback)\n4. Hatchback (older than motorcycle, but newer than station wagon)\n5. Motorcycle (older than truck, but newer than hatchback)\n6. Truck (newer than motorcycle)\n7. Bus (second-newest)\n\nThus, the minivan is indeed the oldest vehicle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) The minivan is the oldest"
