    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and then determine which book is second from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the leftmost.\n2. The black book is the third from the left.\n3. The green book is the third from the right.\n4. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n5. The green book is to the left of the orange book.\n6. The orange book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the purple book is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n- The black book is third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n- The green book is third from the right, which means it is in position 5 (since there are 7 books).\n- The orange book must be to the right of the green book, so it can be in position 6 or 7.\n- The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so it must be in position 7 if the orange book is in position 6.\n- The brown book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be in position 2, and the brown book must be in position 4.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n1. Purple book - Position 1\n2. Yellow book - Position 2\n3. Black book - Position 3\n4. Brown book - Position 4\n5. Green book - Position 5\n6. Orange book - Position 6\n7. Gray book - Position 7\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Now, we can see that the yellow book is second from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<answer>>> G"
