    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. The robin is to the left of the owl.\n2. The crow is the rightmost.\n3. The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\n4. The owl is the third from the right.\n5. The blue jay is to the left of the robin.\n6. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it must be in the 7th position.\n- The owl is the third from the right, which means it is in the 5th position.\n- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, which means it is in the 4th position.\n- The raven is the second from the left, which means it is in the 2nd position.\n- The robin is to the left of the owl, so it must be in the 3rd position.\n- The blue jay is to the left of the robin, so it must be in the 1st position.\n- The falcon is the only bird left, so it must be in the 6th position.\n\nThe final order from left to right is: Blue Jay, Raven, Robin, Hummingbird, Owl, Falcon, Crow.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The blue jay is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(B) The falcon is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(C) The raven is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(D) The crow is the rightmost - Correct\n(E) The robin is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(F) The owl is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(G) The hummingbird is the rightmost - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
