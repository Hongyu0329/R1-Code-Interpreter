    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. The motorcycle is older than the minivan.\n2. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n3. The bus is newer than the truck.\n4. The station wagon is the third-newest.\n5. The sedan is older than the truck.\n6. The tractor is older than the sedan.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The motorcycle is older than the minivan, which is older than the tractor. So, we have: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor.\n- The tractor is older than the sedan, so: Tractor > Sedan.\n- The sedan is older than the truck, so: Sedan > Truck.\n- The bus is newer than the truck, so: Truck > Bus.\n- The station wagon is the third-newest, which means there are two vehicles newer than it.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Motorcycle\n2. Minivan\n3. Tractor\n4. Sedan\n5. Truck\n6. Station Wagon (since it is the third-newest)\n7. Bus\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The motorcycle is the oldest - This is consistent with our arrangement.\n(B) The sedan is the oldest - This is not consistent.\n(C) The station wagon is the oldest - This is not consistent.\n(D) The tractor is the oldest - This is not consistent.\n(E) The minivan is the oldest - This is not consistent.\n(F) The bus is the oldest - This is not consistent.\n(G) The truck is the oldest - This is not consistent.\n\nThe only option that matches our arrangement is (A) The motorcycle is the oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
