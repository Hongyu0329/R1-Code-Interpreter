    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions and determine which bird is fourth from the left.\n\nLet's list the conditions:\n1. The cardinal is to the right of the crow.\n2. The quail is the third from the left.\n3. The owl is to the right of the robin.\n4. The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.\n5. The cardinal is the second from the left.\n6. The owl is the third from the right.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the second from the left, the order starts with the crow, then the cardinal.\n- The quail is the third from the left, so the order is crow, cardinal, quail.\n- The owl is the third from the right, so it must be in the fifth position.\n- The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay, so the blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird.\n- The owl is to the right of the robin, so the robin must be to the left of the owl.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n1. Crow\n2. Cardinal\n3. Quail\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Owl\n6. Robin\n7. Hummingbird\n\nNow, let's check the conditions:\n- The cardinal is to the right of the crow. (True)\n- The quail is the third from the left. (True)\n- The owl is to the right of the robin. (True)\n- The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay. (True)\n- The cardinal is the second from the left. (True)\n- The owl is the third from the right. (True)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Now, we can see that the blue jay is the fourth from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The blue jay is the fourth from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
