    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and then determine which book is third from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the left of the purple book.\n2. The white book is to the right of the brown book.\n3. The black book is the third from the right.\n4. The purple book is to the left of the white book.\n5. The white book is the second from the right.\n6. The gray book is the third from the left.\n7. The brown book is to the right of the green book.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the white book is the second from the right, the arrangement from the right is: [_, _, _, _, _, white, _].\n- The black book is the third from the right, so the arrangement becomes: [_, _, _, _, black, white, _].\n- The gray book is the third from the left, so the arrangement becomes: [_, _, gray, _, black, white, _].\n- The gray book is to the left of the purple book, and the purple book is to the left of the white book, so the arrangement becomes: [_, _, gray, purple, black, white, _].\n- The brown book is to the right of the green book, and the white book is to the right of the brown book, so the arrangement becomes: [green, brown, gray, purple, black, white, _].\n- The only book left is the red book, which must be the first book: [red, green, brown, gray, purple, black, white].\n\nNow, we can determine which book is third from the left:\n\n- The third book from the left is the brown book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The brown book is the third from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
