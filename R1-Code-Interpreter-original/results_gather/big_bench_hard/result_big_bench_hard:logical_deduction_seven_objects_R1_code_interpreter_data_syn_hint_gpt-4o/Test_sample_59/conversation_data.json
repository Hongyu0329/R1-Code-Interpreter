    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and determine which book is fourth from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The red book is to the right of the white book.\n2. The gray book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The gray book is to the right of the blue book.\n4. The red book is the second from the right.\n5. The black book is the fourth from the left.\n6. The orange book is to the left of the white book.\n\nWe have seven positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n- From condition 4, the red book is in position 6.\n- From condition 5, the black book is in position 4.\n\nNow, let's use the other conditions to fill in the rest:\n\n- Condition 1: The red book (position 6) is to the right of the white book, so the white book must be in position 5 or earlier.\n- Condition 6: The orange book is to the left of the white book, so the orange book must be in position 4 or earlier.\n- Condition 2: The gray book is to the left of the orange book, so the gray book must be in position 3 or earlier.\n- Condition 3: The gray book is to the right of the blue book, so the blue book must be in position 2 or earlier.\n\nLet's try to place the books:\n\n1. Blue book (since it must be in position 2 or earlier and is to the left of the gray book).\n2. Gray book (since it must be to the right of the blue book and to the left of the orange book).\n3. Orange book (since it must be to the left of the white book).\n4. Black book (given).\n5. White book (since it must be to the left of the red book).\n6. Red book (given).\n7. Purple book (the only book left).\n\nNow, let's check the positions:\n\n1. Blue book\n2. Gray book\n3. Orange book\n4. Black book\n5. White book\n6. Red book\n7. Purple book\n\nThe black book is indeed fourth from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<'D'>>>"
