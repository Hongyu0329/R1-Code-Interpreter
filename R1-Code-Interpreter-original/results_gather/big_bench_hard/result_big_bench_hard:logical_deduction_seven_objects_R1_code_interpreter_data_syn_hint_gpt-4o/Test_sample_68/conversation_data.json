    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Pears are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n3. Peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n4. Apples are the third-cheapest.\n5. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n6. Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nWe need to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price, from cheapest to most expensive, and then determine which fruit is the cheapest.\n\nLet's start by considering the constraints:\n\n- Since apples are the third-cheapest, they are in position 3.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, so they are in position 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationships:\n\n- Pears > Oranges > Cantaloupes\n- Peaches < Cantaloupes\n\nGiven these relationships, we can deduce:\n\n- Since peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes, peaches must be in position 1 or 2.\n- Since oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes, cantaloupes must be in position 1 or 2.\n- Since pears are more expensive than oranges, pears must be in position 5 or 7.\n\nLet's try to fit these into the positions:\n\n1. Peaches\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Apples\n4. Mangoes\n5. Oranges\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Apples are the third-cheapest.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n- Pears are more expensive than oranges.\n- Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n- Peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n\nThus, the cheapest fruit is peaches.\n\n<<<answer>>> F"
