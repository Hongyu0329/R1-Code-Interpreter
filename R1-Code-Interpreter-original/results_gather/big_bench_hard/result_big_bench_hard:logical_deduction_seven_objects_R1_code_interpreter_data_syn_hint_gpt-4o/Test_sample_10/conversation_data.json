    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Watermelons are the cheapest.\n2. Kiwis are the third-cheapest.\n3. Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n4. Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n5. Peaches are more expensive than mangoes.\n6. Peaches are less expensive than plums.\n\nLet's arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- **Cheapest**: Watermelons\n- **Third-Cheapest**: Kiwis\n\nNow, let's consider the most expensive fruits:\n\n- **Second-Most Expensive**: Cantaloupes\n- **More Expensive than Cantaloupes**: Oranges\n\nSince oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes, they must be the most expensive.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1. Watermelons\n2. ?\n3. Kiwis\n4. ?\n5. ?\n6. Cantaloupes\n7. Oranges\n\nNext, we need to place mangoes, peaches, and plums:\n\n- Peaches are more expensive than mangoes.\n- Peaches are less expensive than plums.\n\nThis means the order of these three fruits must be: Mangoes, Peaches, Plums.\n\nLet's fill in the remaining spots:\n\n1. Watermelons\n2. Mangoes\n3. Kiwis\n4. Peaches\n5. Plums\n6. Cantaloupes\n7. Oranges\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the third-most expensive. From the list, the third-most expensive fruit is Plums.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(G) The plums are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
