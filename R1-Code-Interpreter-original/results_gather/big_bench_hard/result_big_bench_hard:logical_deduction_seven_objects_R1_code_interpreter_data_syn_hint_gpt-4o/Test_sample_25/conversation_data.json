    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in order based on the given conditions:\n\n1. The falcon is the second from the left.\n2. The crow is the rightmost.\n3. The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.\n4. The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird.\n5. The blue jay is to the right of the owl.\n6. The raven is to the left of the falcon.\n\nLet's start placing the birds based on these conditions:\n\n- Since the falcon is the second from the left, we place it in position 2.\n- The crow is the rightmost, so it is in position 7.\n- The raven is to the left of the falcon, so it must be in position 1.\n- The blue jay is to the right of the owl, so the owl cannot be in position 3. The owl must be in position 3, and the blue jay must be in position 4.\n- The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay, so it must be in position 5 or 6.\n- The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird, so the hummingbird must be in position 5, and the hawk must be in position 6.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n1. Raven\n2. Falcon\n3. Owl\n4. Blue Jay\n5. Hummingbird\n6. Hawk\n7. Crow\n\nWith this arrangement, we can see that the blue jay is the fourth from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The blue jay is the fourth from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
