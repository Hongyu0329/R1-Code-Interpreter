    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions and determine which bird is third from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The falcon is to the left of the crow.\n2. The quail is to the right of the cardinal.\n3. The hummingbird is to the right of the quail.\n4. The falcon is the second from the right.\n5. The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk.\n6. The owl is the third from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the birds:\n\n- Since the falcon is second from the right, the arrangement looks like: _ _ _ _ _ Falcon _.\n- The falcon is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be to the right of the falcon: _ _ _ _ _ Falcon Crow.\n- The owl is the third from the left: _ _ Owl _ _ Falcon Crow.\n- The quail is to the right of the cardinal, and the hummingbird is to the right of the quail. Also, the hummingbird is to the left of the hawk. This means the arrangement of these three birds must be Cardinal, Quail, Hummingbird, Hawk.\n- Since the owl is already placed third from the left, the only possible arrangement is: Cardinal, Quail, Owl, Hummingbird, Hawk, Falcon, Crow.\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n- Falcon is to the left of the crow: True.\n- Quail is to the right of the cardinal: True.\n- Hummingbird is to the right of the quail: True.\n- Falcon is second from the right: True.\n- Hummingbird is to the left of the hawk: True.\n- Owl is third from the left: True.\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the conditions, and the owl is indeed third from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The owl is the third from the left.\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
