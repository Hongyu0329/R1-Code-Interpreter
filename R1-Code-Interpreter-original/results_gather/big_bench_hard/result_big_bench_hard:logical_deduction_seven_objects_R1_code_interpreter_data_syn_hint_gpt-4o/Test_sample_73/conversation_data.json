    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Pears are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is one fruit cheaper than pears.\n\n2. **Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes.**\n   - This means cantaloupes are cheaper than peaches.\n\n3. **Peaches are less expensive than mangoes.**\n   - This means mangoes are more expensive than peaches.\n\n4. **Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis.**\n   - This means kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n\n5. **Oranges are the fourth-most expensive.**\n   - This means there are three fruits cheaper than oranges and three fruits more expensive than oranges.\n\n6. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, the only fruit that can be more expensive than watermelons is mangoes (from clue 3).\n- Therefore, the order from most expensive to least expensive starts with mangoes, then watermelons.\n- Oranges are the fourth-most expensive, so there must be two fruits between watermelons and oranges.\n- Peaches are less expensive than mangoes but more expensive than cantaloupes, so peaches can be placed after watermelons.\n- This places peaches as the third-most expensive.\n- Oranges are the fourth-most expensive, so they come after peaches.\n- Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis, so cantaloupes come after oranges.\n- Pears are the second-cheapest, so they come after cantaloupes.\n- Finally, kiwis are the cheapest.\n\nThe order from most expensive to least expensive is:\n1. Mangoes\n2. Watermelons\n3. Peaches\n4. Oranges\n5. Cantaloupes\n6. Pears\n7. Kiwis\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the kiwis are the cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The kiwis are the cheapest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
