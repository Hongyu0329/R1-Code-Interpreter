    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in the correct order based on the given clues. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The owl is the second from the right.\n2. The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n3. The falcon is to the left of the blue jay.\n4. The quail is to the left of the falcon.\n5. The raven is the second from the left.\n6. The robin is to the left of the quail.\n\nLet's start placing the birds based on the information:\n\n- Since the owl is the second from the right, it must be in the 6th position.\n- The cardinal is the fourth from the left, so it is in the 4th position.\n- The raven is the second from the left, so it is in the 2nd position.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining birds: falcon, blue jay, quail, and robin.\n\n- The falcon must be to the left of the blue jay.\n- The quail must be to the left of the falcon.\n- The robin must be to the left of the quail.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the remaining birds:\n\n1. The raven is already in the 2nd position.\n2. The cardinal is in the 4th position.\n3. The owl is in the 6th position.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining birds:\n\n- The robin must be to the left of the quail, so it could be in the 1st position.\n- The quail could be in the 3rd position.\n- The falcon could be in the 5th position.\n- The blue jay could be in the 7th position.\n\nThis gives us the order: Robin, Raven, Quail, Cardinal, Falcon, Owl, Blue Jay.\n\nNow, let's verify the options:\n\n(A) The raven is the second from the left - This is true based on our arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
