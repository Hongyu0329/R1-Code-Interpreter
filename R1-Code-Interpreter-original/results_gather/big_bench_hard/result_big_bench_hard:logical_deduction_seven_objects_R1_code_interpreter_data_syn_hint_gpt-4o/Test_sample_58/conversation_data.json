    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Oranges are the second-cheapest.**\n2. **Mangoes are the third-cheapest.**\n3. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n4. **Loquats are the third-most expensive.**\n5. **Apples are less expensive than pears.**\n6. **Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes.**\n\nGiven these clues, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since oranges are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- Mangoes are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- Loquats are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n- Apples are less expensive than pears, so apples are before pears.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes, so cantaloupes are before mangoes.\n\nLet's fill in the positions:\n\n1. Cantaloupes (since they are cheaper than mangoes)\n2. Oranges\n3. Mangoes\n4. Apples (since they are less expensive than pears)\n5. Loquats\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears (since they are more expensive than apples)\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the fourth-most expensive. According to our arrangement, apples are in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<D>>>"
