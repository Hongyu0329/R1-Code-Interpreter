Amy finished last.\n4. Dan finished below Rob.\n5. Eve finished below Ada.\n6. Rob finished below Joe.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know Dan is third.\n\nFrom statement 3, Amy is last, so she is seventh.\n\nFrom statement 4, Rob must be above Dan, so Rob is either first or second.\n\nFrom statement 6, Rob is below Joe, so Joe must be first, and Rob is second.\n\nNow, the order so far is:\n1. Joe\n2. Rob\n3. Dan\n4. ?\n5. ?\n6. ?\n7.
