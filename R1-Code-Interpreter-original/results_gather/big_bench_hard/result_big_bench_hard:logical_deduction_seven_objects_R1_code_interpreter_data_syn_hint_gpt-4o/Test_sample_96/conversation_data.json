    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Plums are the cheapest.**\n   - This means plums are in the 1st position in terms of price.\n\n2. **Loquats are the third-cheapest.**\n   - This means loquats are in the 3rd position.\n\n3. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This means watermelons are in the 6th position.\n\n4. **Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.**\n   - Since watermelons are in the 6th position, cantaloupes cannot be in the 6th or 7th position. They must be in the 5th position.\n\n5. **Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes.**\n   - Since cantaloupes are in the 5th position, apples must be in the 4th position.\n\n6. **Loquats are less expensive than kiwis.**\n   - Since loquats are in the 3rd position, kiwis must be in the 2nd position.\n\n7. **Apples are more expensive than loquats.**\n   - This is consistent with apples being in the 4th position and loquats in the 3rd position.\n\n8. **Pears are the only fruit left.**\n   - Since all other positions are filled, pears must be in the 7th position.\n\nNow, let's list the fruits in order of increasing price:\n1. Plums\n2. Kiwis\n3. Loquats\n4. Apples\n5. Cantaloupes\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nFrom the options given, we need to identify which fruit is the third-cheapest. According to our arrangement, the third-cheapest fruit is loquats.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(G) The loquats are the third-cheapest\n\n<<<answer>>>"
