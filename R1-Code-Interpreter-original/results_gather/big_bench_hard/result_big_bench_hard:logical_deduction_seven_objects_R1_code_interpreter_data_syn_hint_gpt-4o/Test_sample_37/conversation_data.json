    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Oranges are the second-cheapest.**\n2. **Mangoes are the third-cheapest.**\n3. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n4. **Loquats are the third-most expensive.**\n5. **Apples are less expensive than pears.**\n6. **Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes.**\n\nGiven these clues, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Since oranges are the second-cheapest, they must be in the second position.\n- Mangoes are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in the sixth position.\n- Loquats are the third-most expensive, so they are in the fifth position.\n- Apples are less expensive than pears, so apples must be before pears in the order.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than cantaloupes, so cantaloupes must be in the first position.\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions:\n\n1. Cantaloupes\n2. Oranges\n3. Mangoes\n4. Apples\n5. Loquats\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Now, let's verify the options:\n\n- (A) The loquats are the second-most expensive: False, they are third-most expensive.\n- (B) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive: False, they are the cheapest.\n- (C) The watermelons are the second-most expensive: True, they are in the sixth position.\n- (D) The apples are the second-most expensive: False, they are in the fourth position.\n- (E) The oranges are the second-most expensive: False, they are the second-cheapest.\n- (F) The pears are the second-most expensive: False, they are the most expensive.\n- (G) The mangoes are the second-most expensive: False, they are the third-cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (C).\n\n<<<answer>>>"
