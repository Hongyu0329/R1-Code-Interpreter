    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the purple book.\n2. The white book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The green book is to the right of the brown book.\n4. The yellow book is to the right of the white book.\n5. The red book is to the right of the yellow book.\n6. The brown book is to the right of the red book.\n\nWe need to find the order of the books and determine which book is the rightmost.\n\nLet's try to deduce the order:\n\n- From constraint 6, the brown book is the rightmost because it is to the right of the red book, which is to the right of the yellow book, and so on.\n- The order of the books from left to right, based on the constraints, is: Orange, Green, Purple, White, Yellow, Red, Brown.\n\nNow, let's verify this order with the constraints:\n- Green is to the left of Purple: Satisfied.\n- White is to the right of Orange: Satisfied.\n- Green is to the right of Brown: Not satisfied. This indicates a mistake in the initial assumption.\n- Yellow is to the right of White: Satisfied.\n- Red is to the right of Yellow: Satisfied.\n- Brown is to the right of Red: Satisfied.\n\nThe mistake is in the assumption that the brown book is the rightmost. Let's correct this by re-evaluating the constraints:\n\n- The correct order should be: Orange, Brown, Green, Purple, White, Yellow, Red, Brown.\n\nNow, let's verify this order with the constraints:\n- Green is to the left of Purple: Satisfied.\n- White is to the right of Orange: Satisfied.\n- Green is to the right of Brown: Satisfied.\n- Yellow is to the right of White: Satisfied.\n- Red is to the right of Yellow: Satisfied.\n- Brown is to the right of Red: Satisfied.\n\nThe correct order is: Orange, Brown, Green, Purple, White, Yellow, Red, Brown.\n\nTherefore, the brown book is the rightmost.\n\nThe correct answer is (F) The brown book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
