    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and then determine which book is second from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n2. The green book is to the left of the white book.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n4. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n5. The green book is to the right of the orange book.\n6. The black book is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the white book is the fourth from the left, it occupies the fourth position.\n- The black book is the second from the left, so it occupies the second position.\n- The purple book must be to the left of the yellow book, and the brown book must be to the right of the yellow book.\n- The green book must be to the right of the orange book.\n\nLet's start placing the books:\n\n1. _ (first position)\n2. Black (second position)\n3. _ (third position)\n4. White (fourth position)\n5. _ (fifth position)\n6. _ (sixth position)\n7. _ (seventh position)\n\nNow, let's place the orange and green books:\n\n- The green book is to the right of the orange book, so they can occupy positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n1. Orange\n2. Black\n3. Green\n4. White\n5. _\n6. _\n7. _\n\nNow, place the purple, yellow, and brown books:\n\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, and the brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n- The only way to satisfy these conditions is to place the purple book in position 5, the yellow book in position 6, and the brown book in position 7.\n\n1. Orange\n2. Black\n3. Green\n4. White\n5. Purple\n6. Yellow\n7. Brown\n\nNow, we can see that the yellow book is the second from the right.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The yellow book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<G>>>"
