    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Mangoes are the third-most expensive.**  \n   This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive.\n\n2. **Plums are less expensive than mangoes.**  \n   Since mangoes are third, plums can be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.\n\n3. **Watermelons are less expensive than plums.**  \n   This means watermelons are more expensive than at least one fruit but less expensive than plums.\n\n4. **Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.**  \n   This means oranges are less expensive than watermelons.\n\n5. **Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.**  \n   This means kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n\n6. **Apples are more expensive than loquats.**  \n   This means loquats are less expensive than apples.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these constraints:\n\n- Since mangoes are third, we have:\n  1. Most expensive\n  2. Second-most expensive\n  3. Mangoes\n\n- Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so they can be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.\n\n- Watermelons are less expensive than plums but more expensive than oranges, so they can be fifth, sixth, or seventh.\n\n- Oranges are less expensive than watermelons, so they can be sixth or seventh.\n\n- Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so they must be seventh.\n\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats must be seventh if apples are sixth.\n\nLet's try to fit these into a possible order:\n\n1. Most expensive\n2. Second-most expensive\n3. Mangoes\n4. Plums\n5. Watermelons\n6. Apples\n7. Loquats\n\nThis order satisfies all the constraints. Now, let's check the options:\n\n- (A) The apples are the cheapest: No, loquats are the cheapest.\n- (B) The plums are the cheapest: No, plums are fourth.\n- (C) The mangoes are the cheapest: No, mangoes are third.\n- (D) The watermelons are the cheapest: No, watermelons are fifth.\n- (E) The oranges are the cheapest: No, oranges are sixth.\n- (F) The kiwis are the cheapest: No, kiwis are seventh.\n- (G) The loquats are the cheapest: Yes, loquats are seventh.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<'G'>>>"
