    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions and then determine which bird is third from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The cardinal is the second from the right.\n2. The hawk is the rightmost.\n3. The owl is to the left of the hummingbird.\n4. The robin is to the left of the quail.\n5. The owl is to the right of the crow.\n6. The robin is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's start placing the birds:\n\n- Since the hawk is the rightmost, it is in position 7.\n- The cardinal is second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- The robin is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n\nNow, the positions are as follows:\n1. ?\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. Robin\n5. ?\n6. Cardinal\n7. Hawk\n\nNext, we know:\n- The owl is to the left of the hummingbird.\n- The robin is to the left of the quail.\n- The owl is to the right of the crow.\n\nLet's place the crow and owl:\n- The crow must be to the left of the owl. Since the robin is in position 4, the crow can be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- The owl must be to the right of the crow and to the left of the hummingbird.\n\nLet's try placing the crow in position 1:\n1. Crow\n2. ?\n3. Owl\n4. Robin\n5. ?\n6. Cardinal\n7. Hawk\n\nNow, the owl is in position 3, and the hummingbird must be to the right of the owl. The hummingbird can be in position 5.\n\n1. Crow\n2. ?\n3. Owl\n4. Robin\n5. Hummingbird\n6. Cardinal\n7. Hawk\n\nNow, the quail must be to the right of the robin, so it can be in position 5. But since the hummingbird is already there, the quail must be in position 5, and the hummingbird must be in position 2.\n\n1. Crow\n2. Hummingbird\n3. Owl\n4. Robin\n5. Quail\n6. Cardinal\n7. Hawk\n\nNow, the arrangement is complete, and we can see that the owl is third from the right.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The owl is the third from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
