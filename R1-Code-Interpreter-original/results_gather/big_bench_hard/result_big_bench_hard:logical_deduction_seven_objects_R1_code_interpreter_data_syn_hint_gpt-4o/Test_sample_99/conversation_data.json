    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The motorcycle is older than the minivan.\n2. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n3. The bus is newer than the truck.\n4. The station wagon is the third-newest.\n5. The sedan is older than the truck.\n6. The tractor is older than the sedan.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following order:\n\n- The motorcycle is older than the minivan, which is older than the tractor. So, we have: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor.\n- The tractor is older than the sedan, so: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan.\n- The sedan is older than the truck, so: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan > Truck.\n- The bus is newer than the truck, so: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Sedan > Truck > Bus.\n- The station wagon is the third-newest, which means it is newer than the tractor and older than the truck. So, the order becomes: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor > Station Wagon > Sedan > Truck > Bus.\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the third-oldest. From the order we have deduced:\n\n1. Motorcycle\n2. Minivan\n3. Tractor\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Sedan\n6. Truck\n7. Bus\n\nThe third-oldest vehicle is the Tractor.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The tractor is the third-oldest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
