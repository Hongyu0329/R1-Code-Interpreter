    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints one by one:\n\n1. The falcon is to the right of the quail.\n2. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.\n3. The raven is to the left of the quail.\n4. The blue jay is the second from the left.\n5. The robin is the third from the left.\n6. The cardinal is the third from the right.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the birds in order:\n\n- The blue jay is the second from the left, so the order starts with: [_, Blue Jay, _, _, _, _, _].\n- The robin is the third from the left, so the order is: [_, Blue Jay, Robin, _, _, _, _].\n- The cardinal is the third from the right, so the order is: [_, Blue Jay, Robin, _, Cardinal, _, _].\n- The raven is to the left of the quail, so the raven must be in one of the first two positions. Since the blue jay is already in the second position, the raven must be first: [Raven, Blue Jay, Robin, _, Cardinal, _, _].\n- The falcon is to the right of the quail, and the quail is to the right of the raven. The only positions left for the quail and falcon are the fourth and sixth positions. Since the cardinal is in the fifth position, the quail must be in the fourth position and the falcon in the sixth position: [Raven, Blue Jay, Robin, Quail, Cardinal, Falcon, _].\n- The only bird left is the hummingbird, which must be in the last position: [Raven, Blue Jay, Robin, Quail, Cardinal, Falcon, Hummingbird].\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which bird is the rightmost:\n\n(A) The cardinal is the rightmost - Incorrect, the cardinal is in the fifth position.\n(B) The blue jay is the rightmost - Incorrect, the blue jay is in the second position.\n(C) The robin is the rightmost - Incorrect, the robin is in the third position.\n(D) The falcon is the rightmost - Incorrect, the falcon is in the sixth position.\n(E) The quail is the rightmost - Incorrect, the quail is in the fourth position.\n(F) The hummingbird is the rightmost - Correct, the hummingbird is in the seventh position.\n(G) The raven is the rightmost - Incorrect, the raven is in the first position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (F) The hummingbird is the rightmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
