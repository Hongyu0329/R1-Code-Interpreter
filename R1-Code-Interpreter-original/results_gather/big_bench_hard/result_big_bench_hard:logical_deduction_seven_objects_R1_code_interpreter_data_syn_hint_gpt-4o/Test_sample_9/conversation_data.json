    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions and identify which book is the leftmost.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the rightmost.\n2. The yellow book is the leftmost.\n3. The orange book is the second from the right.\n4. The brown book is to the left of the green book.\n5. The brown book is to the right of the black book.\n6. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the books:\n\n- The yellow book is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n- The purple book is the rightmost, so it is in position 7.\n- The orange book is second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- The white book is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n\nNow, we have the following partial arrangement:\n\n1. Yellow\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. White\n5. ?\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNext, we need to place the brown, black, and green books:\n\n- The brown book is to the left of the green book, so brown must be before green.\n- The brown book is to the right of the black book, so black must be before brown.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only possible arrangement for the remaining books is:\n\n1. Yellow\n2. Black\n3. Brown\n4. White\n5. Green\n6. Orange\n7. Purple\n\nNow, we can see that the yellow book is indeed the leftmost book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The yellow book is the leftmost"
