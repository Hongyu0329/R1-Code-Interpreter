    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions and try to place each bird accordingly:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n2. The owl is the second from the left.\n3. The robin is to the left of the hummingbird.\n4. The quail is to the right of the falcon.\n5. The robin is to the right of the owl.\n6. The blue jay is the third from the right.\n\nLet's start placing the birds:\n\n- Since the owl is the second from the left, we place the owl in the second position.\n- The blue jay is the third from the right, which means it is in the fifth position.\n- The robin is to the right of the owl, so it cannot be in the first position. It must be in the third or fourth position.\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon, and the robin is to the left of the hummingbird. Therefore, the robin must be in the third position, the hummingbird in the fourth, and the falcon in the sixth position.\n- The quail is to the right of the falcon, so it must be in the seventh position.\n- The only position left for the hawk is the first position.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n1. Hawk\n2. Owl\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Blue Jay\n6. Falcon\n7. Quail\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Now, let's check the options to find which bird is the second from the left:\n\n- The owl is the second from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B).\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) The owl is the second from the left"
