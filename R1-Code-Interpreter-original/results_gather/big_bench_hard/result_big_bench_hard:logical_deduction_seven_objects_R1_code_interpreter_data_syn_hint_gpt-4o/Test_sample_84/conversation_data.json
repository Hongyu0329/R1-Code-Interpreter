    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Ana finished last, so Ana is in 7th place.\n2. Mya finished above Rob, so Mya is not in 4th place.\n3. Dan finished above Mya, so Dan is also not in 4th place.\n4. Rob finished fourth, so Rob is in 4th place.\n5. Eli finished second, so Eli is in 2nd place.\n6. Mel finished above Ada, so Mel is not in 6th place.\n\nNow, let's try to place the golfers in order:\n\n- Eli is in 2nd place.\n- Rob is in 4th place.\n- Ana is in 7th place.\n\nSince Dan finished above Mya, and Mya finished above Rob, Dan must be in 1st or 3rd place, and Mya must be in 3rd or 5th place.\n\nMel must finish above Ada, so Mel cannot be in 6th place. Therefore, Ada must be in 6th place, and Mel must be in 1st or 3rd place.\n\nLet's try to fill in the remaining positions:\n\n1. Dan\n2. Eli\n3. Mya\n4. Rob\n5. Mel\n6. Ada\n7. Ana\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Ana is last.\n- Mya is above Rob.\n- Dan is above Mya.\n- Rob is fourth.\n- Eli is second.\n- Mel is above Ada.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Rob finished fourth.\n\n<<<answer>>> (B) Rob finished fourth"
