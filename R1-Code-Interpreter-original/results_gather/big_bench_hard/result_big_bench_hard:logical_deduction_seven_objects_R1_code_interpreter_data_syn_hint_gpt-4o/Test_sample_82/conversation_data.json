    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Mangoes are the third-most expensive.**  \n   This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive.\n\n2. **Plums are less expensive than mangoes.**  \n   This places plums somewhere below mangoes in the order.\n\n3. **Watermelons are less expensive than plums.**  \n   This places watermelons below plums.\n\n4. **Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.**  \n   This places oranges below watermelons.\n\n5. **Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.**  \n   This places kiwis below oranges.\n\n6. **Apples are more expensive than loquats.**  \n   This places loquats below apples.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these constraints:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we have:\n  - Two fruits more expensive than mangoes.\n  - Four fruits less expensive than mangoes.\n\n- Let's start from the least expensive:\n  - Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis are the cheapest.\n  - Oranges are more expensive than kiwis but less expensive than watermelons, so oranges are the second-cheapest.\n  - Watermelons are more expensive than oranges but less expensive than plums, so watermelons are the third-cheapest.\n  - Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so plums are the fourth-cheapest.\n  - Mangoes are the third-most expensive, so they are the fifth-cheapest.\n  - Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats are the sixth-cheapest.\n  - Apples are the most expensive.\n\nThus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Kiwis\n2. Oranges\n3. Watermelons\n4. Plums\n5. Mangoes\n6. Loquats\n7. Apples\n\nFrom this order, we can see that the second-cheapest fruit is oranges.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The oranges are the second-cheapest.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
