    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. The purple book is to the left of the yellow book.\n2. The green book is to the left of the white book.\n3. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n4. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n5. The green book is to the right of the orange book.\n6. The black book is the second from the left.\n\nLet's start placing the books based on the fixed positions and relative positions given:\n\n- The white book is the fourth from the left: _ _ _ W _ _ _\n- The black book is the second from the left: _ B _ W _ _ _\n\nNow, let's use the other conditions to fill in the remaining positions:\n\n- The purple book is to the left of the yellow book, and the brown book is to the right of the yellow book. This means the order of these three books is P, Y, B.\n- The green book is to the left of the white book, and to the right of the orange book. This means the order of these two books is O, G.\n\nLet's try to fit these sequences into the remaining slots:\n\n- The sequence O, G must be placed before W, and P, Y, B must be placed after B.\n- The only way to fit these sequences is: O, B, G, W, P, Y, B\n\nNow, let's fill in the positions:\n\n1. O (Orange)\n2. B (Black)\n3. G (Green)\n4. W (White)\n5. P (Purple)\n6. Y (Yellow)\n7. B (Brown)\n\nThe leftmost book is the Orange book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) The orange book is the leftmost.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
