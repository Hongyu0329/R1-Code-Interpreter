    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in the correct order based on the given conditions and then determine which bird is second from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The owl is the second from the right.\n2. The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n3. The falcon is to the left of the blue jay.\n4. The quail is to the left of the falcon.\n5. The raven is the second from the left.\n6. The robin is to the left of the quail.\n\nWe have seven positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n- From condition 1, the owl is in position 6.\n- From condition 2, the cardinal is in position 4.\n- From condition 5, the raven is in position 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining birds: falcon, blue jay, quail, and robin.\n\n- From condition 3, the falcon is to the left of the blue jay.\n- From condition 4, the quail is to the left of the falcon.\n- From condition 6, the robin is to the left of the quail.\n\nLet's try to place these birds:\n\n- The robin must be to the left of the quail, which must be to the left of the falcon, which must be to the left of the blue jay.\n- The only positions left are 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nLet's place them in order:\n- Position 1: Robin\n- Position 3: Quail\n- Position 5: Falcon\n- Position 7: Blue Jay\n\nNow, the arrangement is:\n1. Robin\n2. Raven\n3. Quail\n4. Cardinal\n5. Falcon\n6. Owl\n7. Blue Jay\n\nAccording to this arrangement, the owl is indeed the second from the right.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The owl is the second from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
