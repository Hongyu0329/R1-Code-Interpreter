  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ada, Amy, Rob, Mya, and Mel. Ada finished below Amy. Joe finished below Dan. Dan finished below Ada. Mel finished third-to-last. Amy finished third. Rob finished below Mya.\nOptions:\n(A) Joe finished third\n(B) Dan finished third\n(C) Ada finished third\n(D) Amy finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n(F) Mya finished third\n(G) Mel finished third\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Ada finished below Amy.\n2. Joe finished below Dan.\n3. Dan finished below Ada.\n4. Mel finished third-to-last.\n5. Amy finished third.\n6. Rob finished below Mya.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- From constraint 5, we know Amy finished third.\n- From constraint 1, Ada must be below Amy, so Ada cannot be third.\n- From constraint 3, Dan is below Ada, so Dan cannot be third.\n- From constraint 2, Joe is below Dan, so Joe cannot be third.\n- From constraint 4, Mel is third-to-last, which means Mel cannot be third.\n- From constraint 6, Rob is below Mya, so Rob cannot be third.\n\nSince Amy is the only one who can be third based on the constraints, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (D) Amy finished third"
