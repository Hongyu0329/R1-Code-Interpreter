    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze the information:\n\n1. The sedan is the third-oldest.\n2. The tractor is newer than the motorcycle.\n3. The bus is older than the motorcycle.\n4. The bus is newer than the hatchback.\n5. The minivan is the newest.\n6. The station wagon is the oldest.\n\nFrom statement 6, we know the station wagon is the oldest. So, it is in the first position.\n\nFrom statement 5, the minivan is the newest, so it is in the last position.\n\nFrom statement 1, the sedan is the third-oldest, so it is in the third position.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining vehicles: bus, motorcycle, hatchback, and tractor.\n\n- From statement 3, the bus is older than the motorcycle.\n- From statement 4, the bus is newer than the hatchback.\n\nThis means the hatchback must be older than the bus, and the motorcycle must be newer than the bus.\n\n- From statement 2, the tractor is newer than the motorcycle.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's arrange the vehicles:\n\n1. Station Wagon (oldest)\n2. Hatchback (older than bus)\n3. Sedan (third-oldest)\n4. Bus (older than motorcycle, newer than hatchback)\n5. Motorcycle (newer than bus)\n6. Tractor (newer than motorcycle)\n7. Minivan (newest)\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n(A) The station wagon is the oldest - This is consistent with our arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> A"
