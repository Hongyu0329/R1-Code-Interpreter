    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Joe finished first.\n2. Mel finished second-to-last, which means Mel is in the 6th position.\n3. Rob finished above Eve, so Rob is in a position higher than Eve.\n4. Mel finished above Eli, so Eli is in a position lower than Mel, which means Eli is in the 7th position.\n5. Rob finished below Ada, so Ada is in a position higher than Rob.\n6. Eve finished fourth.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine the positions:\n\n- Joe is 1st.\n- Eve is 4th.\n- Mel is 6th.\n- Eli is 7th.\n\nNow, we need to place Rob, Ada, and Ana in the remaining positions: 2nd, 3rd, and 5th.\n\n- Rob must be above Eve (4th), so Rob can be 2nd or 3rd.\n- Ada must be above Rob, so Ada can only be 2nd if Rob is 3rd.\n- Ana will take the remaining position.\n\nLet's assign the positions:\n\n- Joe: 1st\n- Ada: 2nd\n- Rob: 3rd\n- Eve: 4th\n- Ana: 5th\n- Mel: 6th\n- Eli: 7th\n\nWith this arrangement, Rob is in the 3rd position.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (F) Rob finished third.\n\n<<<answer>>>F"
