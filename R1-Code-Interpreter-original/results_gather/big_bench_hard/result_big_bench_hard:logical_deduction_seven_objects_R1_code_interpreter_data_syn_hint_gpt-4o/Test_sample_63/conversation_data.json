    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the vehicles based on their age, given the constraints in the paragraph. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The convertible is the second-oldest.\n2. The tractor is the fourth-newest, which means it is the fourth from the youngest.\n3. The minivan is older than the truck.\n4. The truck is older than the limousine.\n5. The hatchback is the third-oldest.\n6. The bus is newer than the limousine.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to arrange the vehicles:\n\n- Since the convertible is the second-oldest, it must be in the second position.\n- The hatchback is the third-oldest, so it must be in the third position.\n- The tractor is the fourth-newest, which means it is the fourth from the youngest, or the fourth-oldest in this context, so it must be in the fourth position.\n- The minivan is older than the truck, and the truck is older than the limousine. Therefore, the order among these three must be: minivan, truck, limousine.\n- The bus is newer than the limousine, so it must be the youngest.\n\nNow, let's place these vehicles in order:\n\n1. Oldest: Minivan\n2. Second-oldest: Convertible\n3. Third-oldest: Hatchback\n4. Fourth-oldest: Tractor\n5. Fifth-oldest: Truck\n6. Sixth-oldest: Limousine\n7. Youngest: Bus\n\nThe convertible is indeed the second-oldest, which matches option (G).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> G"
