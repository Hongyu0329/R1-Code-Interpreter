    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given conditions. Let's analyze the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **The watermelons are less expensive than the plums.**\n   - This means plums are more expensive than watermelons.\n\n2. **The watermelons are more expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means watermelons are more expensive than oranges.\n\n3. **The kiwis are less expensive than the oranges.**\n   - This means kiwis are less expensive than oranges.\n\n4. **The apples are more expensive than the loquats.**\n   - This means apples are more expensive than loquats.\n\n5. **The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.**\n   - This means mangoes are more expensive than plums.\n\n6. **The mangoes are the third-most expensive.**\n   - This directly tells us the position of mangoes.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these conditions:\n\n- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, we place them in the third position.\n- Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so they cannot be in the first or second position. They must be in the fourth position or lower.\n- Watermelons are less expensive than plums, so they must be in a position lower than plums.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges must be in a position lower than watermelons.\n- Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis must be in a position lower than oranges.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats, so apples must be in a position higher than loquats.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to place the fruits:\n\n1. **Most Expensive:**\n2. **Second-Most Expensive:**\n3. **Mangoes**\n4. **Plums** (since they are less expensive than mangoes)\n5. **Watermelons** (since they are less expensive than plums but more expensive than oranges)\n6. **Oranges** (since they are more expensive than kiwis)\n7. **Kiwis** (since they are less expensive than oranges)\n8. **Loquats** (since they are less expensive than apples)\n\nNow, we need to fill the first and second positions. Since apples are more expensive than loquats, apples can be in the first or second position. Let's assume:\n\n1. **Apples**\n2. **Loquats**\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) The mangoes are the third-most expensive"
