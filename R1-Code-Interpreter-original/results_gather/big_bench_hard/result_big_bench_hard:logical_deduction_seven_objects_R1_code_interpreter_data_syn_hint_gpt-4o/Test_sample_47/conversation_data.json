    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and then determine which book is second from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The brown book is the rightmost.\n2. The black book is to the right of the white book.\n3. The gray book is the third from the left.\n4. The orange book is to the right of the gray book.\n5. The orange book is to the left of the green book.\n6. The blue book is the third from the right.\n\nWe have seven positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (from left to right).\n\n- From condition 3, the gray book is in position 3.\n- From condition 6, the blue book is in position 5 (third from the right).\n- From condition 1, the brown book is in position 7 (rightmost).\n- From condition 4, the orange book must be in position 4 or 5, but since the blue book is in position 5, the orange book is in position 4.\n- From condition 5, the green book must be to the right of the orange book, so it must be in position 6.\n- From condition 2, the black book must be to the right of the white book. The only positions left are 1 and 2, so the white book is in position 1 and the black book is in position 2.\n\nNow, the arrangement is:\n1. White\n2. Black\n3. Gray\n4. Orange\n5. Blue\n6. Green\n7. Brown\n\nThe book in the second position from the right is the green book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The green book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
