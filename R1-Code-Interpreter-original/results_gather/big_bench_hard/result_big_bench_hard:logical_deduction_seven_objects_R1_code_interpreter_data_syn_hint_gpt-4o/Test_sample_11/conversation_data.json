The black book is the fourth from the left.\n6. The brown book is the third from the right.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the books:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it is in position 7.\n- The brown book is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n- The black book is the fourth from the left, which means it is in position 4.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining books (white, blue, green, orange) according to the conditions:\n\n- The blue book is to the left of the orange book, so blue must be before orange.\n- The green book is to the right of the white book, so white must be before green.\n- The blue book is to the right of the green book, so green must be before blue.\n\nLet's try to place them:\n\n1. White book\n2. Green book\n3. Blue book\n4. Black book\n5. Brown book\n6. Orange book\n7. Yellow book\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The yellow book is the rightmost: Correct.\n- The blue book is to the left of the orange book: Correct.\n- The green book is to the right of the white book: Correct.\n- The blue book is to the right of the green book: Correct.\n- The black book is the fourth from the left: Correct.\n- The brown book is the third from the right: Correct.\n\nThe arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the book that is fourth from the left is the black book.\n\n<<<answer>>> (C) The black book is the fourth from the left"
