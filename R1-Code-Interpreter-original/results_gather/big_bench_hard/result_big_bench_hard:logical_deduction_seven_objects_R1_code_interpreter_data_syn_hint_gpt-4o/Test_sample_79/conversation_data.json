The red book is to the right of the yellow book.\n2. The white book is the second from the right.\n3. The red book is to the left of the green book.\n4. The blue book is to the right of the black book.\n5. The black book is the third from the right.\n6. The orange book is the leftmost.\n\nNow, let's arrange the books:\n\n- Since the orange book is the leftmost, it must be in the first position.\n- The black book is the third from the right, which means it is in the 5th position.\n- The white book is the second from the right, which means it is in the 6th position.\n- The blue book is to the right of the black book, so it must be in the 7th position.\n- The red book is to the right of the yellow book and to the left of the green book. Since the black, white, and blue books occupy the 5th, 6th, and 7th positions, the red book must be in the 3rd position, the yellow book in the 2nd position, and the green book in the 4th position.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n1.
