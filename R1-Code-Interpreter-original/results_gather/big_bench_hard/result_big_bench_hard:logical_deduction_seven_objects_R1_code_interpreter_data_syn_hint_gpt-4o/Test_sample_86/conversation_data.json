    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given conditions and identify which vehicle is the fourth-newest.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The station wagon is the fourth-newest.\n2. The motorcycle is newer than the truck.\n3. The station wagon is older than the hatchback.\n4. The minivan is newer than the hatchback.\n5. The bus is newer than the minivan.\n6. The truck is newer than the limousine.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that the station wagon is the fourth-newest. This directly matches option (D).\n\nLet's verify if this order is consistent with the other conditions:\n\n- Since the station wagon is the fourth-newest, there are three vehicles newer than it.\n- From condition 3, the hatchback is newer than the station wagon, so it must be one of the three newer vehicles.\n- From condition 4, the minivan is newer than the hatchback, so it must also be one of the three newer vehicles.\n- From condition 5, the bus is newer than the minivan, so it must be the newest vehicle.\n\nThus, the order from newest to oldest for the top four vehicles is: Bus, Minivan, Hatchback, Station Wagon.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining vehicles: motorcycle, truck, and limousine.\n\n- From condition 2, the motorcycle is newer than the truck.\n- From condition 6, the truck is newer than the limousine.\n\nTherefore, the order from newest to oldest for these three vehicles is: Motorcycle, Truck, Limousine.\n\nCombining both parts, the complete order from newest to oldest is:\n1. Bus\n2. Minivan\n3. Hatchback\n4. Station Wagon\n5. Motorcycle\n6. Truck\n7. Limousine\n\nThe station wagon is indeed the fourth-newest, which matches option (D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<'D'>>>"
