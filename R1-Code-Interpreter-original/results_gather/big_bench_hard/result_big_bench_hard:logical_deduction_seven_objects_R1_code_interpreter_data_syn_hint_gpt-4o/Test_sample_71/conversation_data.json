    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and then determine which book is third from the right.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The white book is the leftmost.\n2. The red book is to the right of the blue book.\n3. The orange book is the second from the right.\n4. The gray book is the fourth from the left.\n5. The black book is the rightmost.\n6. The gray book is to the right of the red book.\n\nLet's arrange the books step by step:\n\n- Since the white book is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n- The black book is the rightmost, so it is in position 7.\n- The orange book is the second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- The gray book is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n\nNow, we have the following partial arrangement:\n\n1. White\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. Gray\n5. ?\n6. Orange\n7. Black\n\nNext, we know the red book is to the right of the blue book, and the gray book is to the right of the red book. Therefore, the blue book must be in position 2, the red book in position 3, and the brown book in position 5.\n\nThe final arrangement is:\n\n1. White\n2. Blue\n3. Red\n4. Gray\n5. Brown\n6. Orange\n7. Black\n\nNow, we can see that the brown book is the third from the right.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The brown book is the third from the right.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
