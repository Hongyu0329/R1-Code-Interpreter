    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Pears are the second-cheapest.**\n   - This means there is one fruit cheaper than pears.\n\n2. **Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes.**\n   - This means cantaloupes are cheaper than peaches.\n\n3. **Peaches are less expensive than mangoes.**\n   - This means mangoes are more expensive than peaches.\n\n4. **Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis.**\n   - This means kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes.\n\n5. **Oranges are the fourth-most expensive.**\n   - This places oranges in the middle of the list.\n\n6. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**\n   - This places watermelons just below the most expensive fruit.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these clues:\n\n- Since pears are the second-cheapest, they are in position 6 (from the most expensive).\n- Kiwis must be the cheapest because they are cheaper than cantaloupes, which are cheaper than peaches.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 2.\n- Oranges are the fourth-most expensive, so they are in position 4.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than peaches, and since watermelons are second, mangoes must be the most expensive.\n- Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes, so peaches are in position 3, and cantaloupes are in position 5.\n\nArranging them from most expensive to least expensive, we get:\n1. Mangoes\n2. Watermelons\n3. Peaches\n4. Oranges\n5. Cantaloupes\n6. Pears\n7. Kiwis\n\nFrom this arrangement, we see that peaches are the third-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n(G) The peaches are the third-most expensive\n\n<<<answer>>>"
