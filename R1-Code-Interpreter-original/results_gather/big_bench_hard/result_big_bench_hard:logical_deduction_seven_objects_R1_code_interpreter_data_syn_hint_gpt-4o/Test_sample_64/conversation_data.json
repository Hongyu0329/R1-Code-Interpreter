    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. Ada finished below Amy.\n2. Joe finished below Dan.\n3. Dan finished below Ada.\n4. Mel finished third-to-last.\n5. Amy finished third.\n6. Rob finished below Mya.\n\nLet's start by placing Amy, as her position is fixed:\n\n- Amy is 3rd.\n\nNow, let's consider Mel's position:\n\n- Mel is third-to-last, which means Mel is 5th.\n\nNext, let's place Ada, Dan, and Joe based on the constraints:\n\n- Ada finished below Amy, so Ada cannot be 1st or 2nd. Since Amy is 3rd, Ada can be 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th.\n- Dan finished below Ada, so Dan cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. Dan can be 5th, 6th, or 7th.\n- Joe finished below Dan, so Joe cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Joe can be 6th or 7th.\n\nSince Mel is 5th, Ada cannot be 5th. Therefore, Ada can be 4th, 6th, or 7th. \n\nLet's place Ada in 4th position:\n\n- Ada is 4th.\n\nNow, Dan must be below Ada, so Dan can be 6th or 7th. Since Mel is 5th, Dan cannot be 5th. \n\nLet's place Dan in 6th position:\n\n- Dan is 6th.\n\nNow, Joe must be below Dan, so Joe must be 7th:\n\n- Joe is 7th.\n\nFinally, we need to place Rob and Mya. Since Rob finished below Mya, and the only remaining positions are 1st and 2nd, Mya must be 1st and Rob must be 2nd:\n\n- Mya is 1st.\n- Rob is 2nd.\n\nThe final order is:\n\n1. Mya\n2. Rob\n3. Amy\n4. Ada\n5. Mel\n6. Dan\n7. Joe\n\nTherefore, Joe finished last. The correct option is (A) Joe finished last.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
