    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the golfers based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Dan finished third.\n2. Ana finished above Ada.\n3. Amy finished last.\n4. Dan finished below Rob.\n5. Eve finished below Ada.\n6. Rob finished below Joe.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions step by step:\n\n- Since Dan finished third, the positions for first and second are still open.\n- Ana finished above Ada, so Ana cannot be last, and Ada cannot be first.\n- Amy finished last, so she is in the 7th position.\n- Dan finished below Rob, so Rob must be in either the 1st or 2nd position.\n- Eve finished below Ada, so Eve cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position.\n- Rob finished below Joe, so Joe must be in the 1st position, and Rob must be in the 2nd position.\n\nGiven these deductions, we can start filling in the positions:\n\n1. Joe\n2. Rob\n3. Dan\n4. Ana (since Ana must be above Ada and below Dan)\n5. Ada (since Ada must be above Eve and below Ana)\n6. Eve\n7. Amy\n\nNow, we can see that Rob finished second.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (E) Rob finished second.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
