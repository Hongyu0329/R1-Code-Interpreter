    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Mangoes are the third-most expensive.**  \n   This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive.\n\n2. **Plums are less expensive than mangoes.**  \n   Since mangoes are third, plums cannot be first or second. Plums must be fourth or lower.\n\n3. **Watermelons are less expensive than plums.**  \n   Since plums are fourth or lower, watermelons must be fifth or lower.\n\n4. **Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.**  \n   This means oranges must be sixth or lower.\n\n5. **Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.**  \n   Since oranges are sixth or lower, kiwis must be seventh.\n\n6. **Apples are more expensive than loquats.**  \n   This means loquats cannot be the most expensive.\n\nNow, let's try to place the fruits in order:\n\n- **1st and 2nd positions:** Apples and one other fruit (since mangoes are third).\n- **3rd position:** Mangoes.\n- **4th position:** Plums (since they are less expensive than mangoes).\n- **5th position:** Watermelons (since they are less expensive than plums but more expensive than oranges).\n- **6th position:** Oranges (since they are less expensive than watermelons but more expensive than kiwis).\n- **7th position:** Kiwis (since they are less expensive than oranges).\n\nGiven these constraints, the only fruit that can be the most expensive is apples. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<'answer': 'A'>>>"
