    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to calculate the net movement based on the instructions:\n\n1. Take 5 steps forward.\n2. Take 7 steps backward.\n3. Take 10 steps backward.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Forward steps: +5\n- Backward steps: -7 - 10 = -17\n\nNet movement = Forward steps + Backward steps = 5 - 17 = -12\n\nSince the net movement is -12, you do not return to the starting point. You end up 12 steps behind the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
