    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, we can calculate the net number of steps taken:\n\n1. Start at position 0.\n2. Take 6 steps forward: Position = 0 + 6 = 6\n3. Take 7 steps backward: Position = 6 - 7 = -1\n4. Take 7 steps backward: Position = -1 - 7 = -8\n5. Take 8 steps forward: Position = -8 + 8 = 0\n\nSince the final position is 0, you return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
