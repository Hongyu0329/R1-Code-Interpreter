    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. **Take 6 steps left**: This means you move 6 units to the left.\n2. **Take 3 steps backward**: This means you move 3 units backward.\n3. **Take 3 steps left**: This means you move 3 more units to the left.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Total movement to the left: \\(6 + 3 = 9\\) steps left.\n- Total movement backward: 3 steps backward.\n\nSince there is a net movement both to the left and backward, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
