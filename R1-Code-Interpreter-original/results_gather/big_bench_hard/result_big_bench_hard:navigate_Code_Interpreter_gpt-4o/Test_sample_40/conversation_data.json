Take 1 step left.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Steps to the left: \\(8 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 16\\)\n- Steps to the right: \\(6 + 10 = 16\\)\n\nNet movement = Steps to the left - Steps to the right = \\(16 - 16 = 0\\)\n\nSince the net movement is 0, you return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
