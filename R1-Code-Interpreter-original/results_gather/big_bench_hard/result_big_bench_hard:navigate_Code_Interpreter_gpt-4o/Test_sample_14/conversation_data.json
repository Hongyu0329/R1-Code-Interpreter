    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0).\n2. Take 3 steps left: This means moving 3 steps in the negative direction, so the position is now -3.\n3. Take 10 steps right: This means moving 10 steps in the positive direction, so the position is now -3 + 10 = 7.\n4. Take 7 steps left: This means moving 7 steps in the negative direction, so the position is now 7 - 7 = 0.\n\nSince the final position is 0, you return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
