    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Turn right**: Assume you start facing north. Turning right means you now face east.\n2. **Take 3 steps**: You move 3 steps east.\n3. **Turn around**: Turning around from facing east means you now face west.\n4. **Take 3 steps**: You move 3 steps west, which brings you back to your original east-west position.\n5. **Turn left**: From facing west, turning left means you now face south.\n\nAfter following these instructions, you are back at the starting point in terms of position, but facing south instead of north.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
