    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Turn left**: This changes your direction by 90 degrees to the left.\n2. **Take 4 steps**: You move 4 steps in the new direction.\n3. **Turn around**: This changes your direction by 180 degrees, effectively reversing your direction.\n4. **Take 4 steps**: You move 4 steps in the new direction, which is opposite to the direction you moved in step 2.\n\nSince you take 4 steps in one direction and then turn around and take 4 steps back, you will return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
