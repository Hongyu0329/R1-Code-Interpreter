Take 1 step (forward).\n5. Turn left.\n6. Take 7 steps (in the new direction).\n\nInitially, you are moving in a straight line. After the first four instructions, you have taken a total of 25 steps forward. Then, you turn left and take 7 steps in a new direction. \n\nSince you only turned left once and did not make any further turns, you are not heading back towards the starting point. Therefore, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
