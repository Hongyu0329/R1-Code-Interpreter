    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions and track the movements:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Take 8 steps forward: Move 8 steps in the positive y-direction. New position: (0, 8).\n3. Take 9 steps right: Move 9 steps in the positive x-direction. New position: (9, 8).\n4. Take 2 steps forward: Move 2 steps in the positive y-direction. New position: (9, 10).\n5. Take 10 steps backward: Move 10 steps in the negative y-direction. New position: (9, 0).\n6. Take 9 steps left: Move 9 steps in the negative x-direction. New position: (0, 0).\n\nThe final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
