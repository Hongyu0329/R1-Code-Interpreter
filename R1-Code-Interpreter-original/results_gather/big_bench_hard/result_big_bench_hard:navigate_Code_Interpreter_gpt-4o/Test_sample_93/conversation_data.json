    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 7 steps**: You move 7 steps forward.\n2. **Turn around**: You are now facing the opposite direction.\n3. **Take 10 steps**: You move 10 steps in the opposite direction.\n4. **Take 2 steps**: You continue moving 2 more steps in the same direction.\n5. **Turn around**: You are now facing the original direction.\n6. **Take 5 steps**: You move 5 steps forward in the original direction.\n7. **Turn left**: This changes your direction, but does not affect your position.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you move 7 steps forward.\n- After turning around, you move 10 + 2 = 12 steps backward.\n- After turning around again, you move 5 steps forward.\n\nNet movement = 7 (forward) - 12 (backward) + 5 (forward) = 0 steps.\n\nSince the net movement is 0, you return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
