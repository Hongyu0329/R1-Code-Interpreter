    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0) and face forward (let's assume forward is along the positive y-axis).\n2. Take 8 steps forward: This moves you to (0, 8).\n3. Take 5 steps backward: This moves you to (0, 3).\n4. Take 5 steps left: This moves you to (-5, 3).\n5. Take 5 steps forward: This moves you to (-5, 8).\n\nThe final position is (-5, 8), which is not the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
