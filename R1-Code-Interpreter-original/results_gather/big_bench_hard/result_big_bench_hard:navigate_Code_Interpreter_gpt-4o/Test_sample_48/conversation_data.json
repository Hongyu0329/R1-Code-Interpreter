Take 6 steps to the left.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Steps to the right: 2 + 4 = 6 steps\n- Steps to the left: 6 steps\n\nNet movement = 6 steps to the right - 6 steps to the left = 0 steps\n\nSince the net movement is 0 steps, you return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
