    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n1. Start at the initial position (0).\n2. Take 4 steps forward: Position = 0 + 4 = 4\n3. Take 2 steps backward: Position = 4 - 2 = 2\n4. Take 10 steps backward: Position = 2 - 10 = -8\n\nThe final position is -8, which is not the starting point (0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
