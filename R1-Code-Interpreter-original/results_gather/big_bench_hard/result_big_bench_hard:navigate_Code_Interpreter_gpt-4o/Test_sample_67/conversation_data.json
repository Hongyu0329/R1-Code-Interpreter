Take 5 steps left.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Steps to the right: 1 + 4 = 5 steps\n- Steps to the left: 5 steps\n\nNet movement = Steps to the right - Steps to the left = 5 - 5 = 0 steps\n\nSince the net movement is 0 steps, you return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
