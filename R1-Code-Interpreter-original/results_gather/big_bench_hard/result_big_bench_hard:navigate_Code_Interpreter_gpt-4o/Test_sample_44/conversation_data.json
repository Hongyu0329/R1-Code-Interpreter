    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's analyze the instructions step by step:\n\n1. Start at the starting point (position 0).\n2. Take 7 steps forward: Position = 0 + 7 = 7\n3. Take 7 steps backward: Position = 7 - 7 = 0\n4. Take 10 steps backward: Position = 0 - 10 = -10\n5. Take 10 steps forward: Position = -10 + 10 = 0\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you end up at position 0, which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
