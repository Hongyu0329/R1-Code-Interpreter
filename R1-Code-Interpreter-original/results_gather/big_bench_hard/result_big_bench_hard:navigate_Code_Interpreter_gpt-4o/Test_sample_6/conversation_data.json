    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, we need to track the movements step by step:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0) facing forward (positive y-direction).\n2. Take 6 steps right: Move 6 units in the positive x-direction. New position: (6, 0).\n3. Take 1 step forward: Move 1 unit in the positive y-direction. New position: (6, 1).\n4. Take 10 steps left: Move 10 units in the negative x-direction. New position: (-4, 1).\n5. Take 8 steps forward: Move 8 units in the positive y-direction. New position: (-4, 9).\n6. Take 9 steps backward: Move 9 units in the negative y-direction. New position: (-4, 0).\n7. Take 4 steps right: Move 4 units in the positive x-direction. New position: (0, 0).\n\nThe final position is (0, 0), which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
