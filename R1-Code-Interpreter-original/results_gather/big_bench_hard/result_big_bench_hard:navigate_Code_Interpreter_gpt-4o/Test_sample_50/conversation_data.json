Turn around. (Now facing the opposite direction)\n4. Take 8 steps forward in the new direction. (Effectively 8 steps back from the 17 steps forward, so now 9 steps forward from the starting point)\n5. Take 9 steps forward in the same direction. (Effectively 9 steps back from the 9 steps forward, so now back to the starting point)\n\nSince the final position is the starting point, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
