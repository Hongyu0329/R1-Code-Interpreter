Take 8 steps backward.\n\nSince you are always facing forward, taking steps backward means moving in the opposite direction from the starting point. \n\n- After taking 2 steps backward, you are 2 steps away from the starting point.\n- After taking 8 more steps backward, you are 10 steps away from the starting point.\n\nTherefore, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
