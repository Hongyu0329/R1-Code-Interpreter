    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. **Take 9 steps**: You move 9 steps forward.\n2. **Turn left**: You change direction 90 degrees to the left.\n3. **Turn left**: You change direction another 90 degrees to the left, which means you are now facing the opposite direction from where you started.\n4. **Take 5 steps**: You move 5 steps forward in the new direction.\n5. **Take 4 steps**: You move 4 steps forward in the same direction.\n6. **Turn left**: You change direction 90 degrees to the left.\n7. **Turn left**: You change direction another 90 degrees to the left, which means you are now facing the opposite direction from the last direction you were moving.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initially, you move 9 steps in one direction.\n- After two left turns, you move 5 + 4 = 9 steps in the opposite direction.\n\nSince the net movement in both directions is equal and opposite, you return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
