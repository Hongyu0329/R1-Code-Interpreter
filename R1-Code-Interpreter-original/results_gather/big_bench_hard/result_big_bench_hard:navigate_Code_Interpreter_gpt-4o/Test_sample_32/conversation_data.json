Take 10 steps in a straight line.\n\nWhen you take 10 steps initially, you move away from the starting point. Turning left twice results in a 180-degree turn, which means you are now facing the opposite direction. Taking 10 steps in this new direction will bring you back to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
