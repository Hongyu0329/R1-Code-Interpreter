    "\nassistant > Let's break down the instructions step by step:\n\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0) facing forward.\n2. Take 5 steps backward: This moves you to (0, -5).\n3. Take 2 steps left: This moves you to (-2, -5).\n4. Take 5 steps right: This moves you to (3, -5).\n5. Take 3 steps left: This moves you to (0, -5).\n6. Take 5 steps backward: This moves you to (0, -10).\n7. Take 10 steps forward: This moves you to (0, 0).\n\nAfter following all the instructions, you return to the starting point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
