Take 4 steps left.\n\nAssuming \"right\" and \"left\" are relative to the initial forward direction:\n\n- Taking 2 steps right means moving 2 steps to the right of the starting point.\n- Taking another 2 steps right means moving an additional 2 steps to the right, totaling 4 steps to the right.\n- Taking 4 steps left means moving 4 steps to the left from the current position.\n\nStarting from 4 steps to the right, moving 4 steps left will bring you back to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, you do return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
