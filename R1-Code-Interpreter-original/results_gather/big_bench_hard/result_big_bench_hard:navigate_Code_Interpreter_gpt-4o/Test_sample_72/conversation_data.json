    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down the instructions:\n\n1. Take 5 steps forward.\n2. Take another 5 steps forward.\n3. Take 2 more steps forward.\n4. Turn around (this changes your direction to the opposite).\n5. Take 8 steps in the new direction (backward relative to the original direction).\n6. Take 4 more steps in the same direction (backward relative to the original direction).\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Initial steps forward: \\(5 + 5 + 2 = 12\\) steps forward.\n- After turning around, steps backward: \\(8 + 4 = 12\\) steps backward.\n\nSince the forward and backward steps are equal, you return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
