Take 4 steps backward.\n4. Take 4 steps backward.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Forward steps: 9\n- Backward steps: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9\n\nNet movement = Forward steps - Backward steps = 9 - 9 = 0\n\nSince the net movement is 0, you return to the starting point.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
