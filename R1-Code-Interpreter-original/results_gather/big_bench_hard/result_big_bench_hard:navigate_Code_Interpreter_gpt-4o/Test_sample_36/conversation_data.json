    "\nassistant > To determine if you return to the starting point, we can break down the instructions into movements along a coordinate plane, where:\n\n- Forward is along the positive y-axis.\n- Backward is along the negative y-axis.\n- Left is along the negative x-axis.\n- Right is along the positive x-axis.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n1. Take 9 steps forward: \\( (0, 9) \\)\n2. Take 7 steps left: \\( (-7, 9) \\)\n3. Take 5 steps backward: \\( (-7, 4) \\)\n4. Take 4 steps right: \\( (-3, 4) \\)\n5. Take 3 steps right: \\( (0, 4) \\)\n6. Take 4 steps backward: \\( (0, 0) \\)\n\nThe final position is \\( (0, 0) \\), which is the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
