    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence step by step. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`. Our goal is to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets and their types:**\n   - The sequence starts with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - Next, there is an opening curly brace `{`.\n   - Then, an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - Another opening curly brace `{`.\n   - An opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - An opening curly brace `{`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening angle bracket `<`.\n\n2. **Identify the closing brackets and their types:**\n   - The first closing bracket is an angle bracket `>`, which closes the last opened angle bracket `<`.\n   - Next, there is a closing parenthesis `)`, which closes the last opened parenthesis `(`.\n   - Then, a closing curly brace `}`, which closes the last opened curly brace `{`.\n\n3. **Continue the sequence to close all remaining open brackets:**\n   - After the closing curly brace `}`, the sequence has an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - We need to close this angle bracket with a `>`.\n   - Next, we need to close the curly brace `{` that was opened before the angle bracket.\n   - Then, we need to close the angle bracket `<` that was opened before the curly brace.\n   - Next, we need to close the curly brace `{` that was opened before the angle bracket.\n   - Finally, we need to close the initial parenthesis `(`.\n\n4. **Construct the completed sequence:**\n   - The sequence starts with: `( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } >`\n   - We add the necessary closing brackets: `} > } )`\n\n5. **Final completed sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence is: `( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > } > } )`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > } > } )>>>"
