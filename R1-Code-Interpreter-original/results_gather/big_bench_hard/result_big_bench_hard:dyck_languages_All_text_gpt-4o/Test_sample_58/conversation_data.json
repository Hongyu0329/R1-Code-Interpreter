    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] )`\n\n2. **Identify Opening and Closing Pairs**:\n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Brackets: `[` and `]`\n   - Braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle Brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n3. **Analyze the Sequence**:\n   - Start with `<`, which is an opening angle bracket.\n   - Next is `(`, an opening parenthesis.\n   - Followed by `[`, an opening bracket.\n   - Another `[`, another opening bracket.\n   - Another `[`, another opening bracket.\n   - Another `[`, another opening bracket.\n   - Then `(`, an opening parenthesis.\n   - `)`, a closing parenthesis, matches the last opened `(`.\n   - `]`, a closing bracket, matches the last opened `[`.\n   - `]`, a closing bracket, matches the next last opened `[`.\n   - `{`, an opening brace.\n   - `}`, a closing brace, matches the last opened `{`.\n   - `]`, a closing bracket, matches the next last opened `[`.\n   - `]`, a closing bracket, matches the next last opened `[`.\n   - `)`, a closing parenthesis, matches the last opened `(`.\n\n4. **Remaining Unmatched Opening Bracket**:\n   - The sequence starts with `<`, which is an opening angle bracket that hasn't been closed yet.\n\n5. **Complete the Sequence**:\n   - To properly close the sequence, we need to add a closing angle bracket `>` at the end.\n\n6. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The complete sequence with all pairs properly closed is: `< ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] ) >`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> < ( [ [ [ [ ( ) ] ] { } ] ] ) >"
