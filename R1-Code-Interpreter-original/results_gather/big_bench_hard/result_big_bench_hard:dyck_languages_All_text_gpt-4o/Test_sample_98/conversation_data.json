    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Parentheses:**\n   - The input sequence is: `( { ( )`\n   - We have three opening parentheses: `(`, `{`, and `(`.\n   - We have one closing parenthesis: `)`.\n\n2. **Determine the Order of Closing:**\n   - Parentheses must be closed in the reverse order of their opening.\n   - The last opened parenthesis is `(`, which is closed by `)`. This is already present in the sequence.\n   - The next opened parenthesis is `{`, which must be closed by `}`.\n   - The first opened parenthesis is `(`, which must be closed by `)`.\n\n3. **Complete the Sequence:**\n   - The sequence currently is: `( { ( )`\n   - After closing the `{` with `}`, the sequence becomes: `( { ( ) }`\n   - Finally, close the first `(` with `)`, resulting in: `( { ( ) } )`\n\n4. **Verify the Sequence:**\n   - Check that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order:\n     - The first `(` is closed by the last `)`.\n     - The `{` is closed by `}`.\n     - The second `(` is closed by the first `)`.\n\nThe sequence is now complete and all parentheses are properly closed.\n\nFinal answer: <<< ( { ( ) } ) >>>"
