    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence given is:\n\n\\[ [ \\{ \\{ < ( ) > \\} \\} \\]\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - This is followed by an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - Next, there is an opening curly brace `{`.\n   - Another opening curly brace `{` follows.\n   - Then, there is an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - Finally, there is an opening parenthesis `(`.\n\n2. **Identify the closing brackets:**\n   - The first closing bracket is a parenthesis `)`, which matches the last opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - The next closing bracket is an angle bracket `>`, which matches the last opening angle bracket `<`.\n\n3. **Remaining opening brackets:**\n   - After closing the parenthesis and angle bracket, we are left with two opening curly braces `{ {`, two opening square brackets `[ [`, and no closing brackets.\n\n4. **Close the remaining brackets:**\n   - The next brackets to close are the curly braces. We need two closing curly braces `}` to match the two opening curly braces `{ {`.\n   - Finally, we need two closing square brackets `]` to match the two opening square brackets `[ [`.\n\n5. **Construct the completed sequence:**\n   - Start with the given sequence: \\[ [ \\{ \\{ < ( ) > \\} \\} \\]\n   - Add the necessary closing brackets: \\[ [ \\{ \\{ < ( ) > \\} \\} \\] \\]\n\nThe completed sequence with all brackets properly closed is:\n\n\\[ [ \\{ \\{ < ( ) > \\} \\} ] \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ [ { { < ( ) > } } ] ]>>>"
