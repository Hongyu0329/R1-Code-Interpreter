    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and identify the opening and closing of each type of bracket. The sequence consists of three types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, parentheses `( )`, and square brackets `[ ]`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with an angle bracket `<`.\n   - This is followed by an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - Next, there is another opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - Then, an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - Another opening parenthesis `(` follows.\n   - Finally, an opening square bracket `[`.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets:**\n   - The first closing bracket is a square bracket `]`, which closes the last opened square bracket `[`.\n   - The next closing bracket is a parenthesis `)`, which closes the last opened parenthesis `(`.\n   - Then, there is a closing square bracket `]`, which closes the square bracket `[` that was opened before the last parenthesis.\n   - The next closing bracket is a parenthesis `)`, which closes the parenthesis `(` that was opened before the last square bracket.\n   - Finally, there is a closing parenthesis `)`, which closes the first parenthesis `(` that was opened.\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Closing Brackets:**\n   - After closing all the parentheses and square brackets, we are left with the initial angle bracket `<` that needs to be closed with a `>`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe sequence is completed by adding a closing angle bracket `>` at the end to properly close all the opened brackets.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<< < ( ( [ ( [ ] ) ] ) ) > >>>"
