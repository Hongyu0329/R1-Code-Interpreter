    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses and other symbols are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence step by step. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, angle brackets `<>`, and square brackets `[]`. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n\n1. **Opening Brackets:**\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `(` (parenthesis)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n\n2. **Closing Brackets:**\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the last `<`\n   - `}` (curly brace) closes the last `{`\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the last `<`\n   - `}` (curly brace) closes the last `{`\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `}` (curly brace) closes the last `{`\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the last `<`\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `]` (square bracket) closes the last `[`\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the last `<`\n   - `]` (square bracket) closes the last `[`\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the last `<`\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the last `<`\n\n3. **Remaining Open Brackets:**\n   - `{` (curly brace) from the beginning\n   - `(` (parenthesis) from the beginning\n   - `{` (curly brace) from the beginning\n\n4. **Closing the Remaining Open Brackets:**\n   - `}` to close the last `{`\n   - `}` to close the second `{`\n   - `)` to close the `(`\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all brackets are properly closed.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n```\n{ ( { { < { < > } > } < { } > < < < [ < [ ] > ] > > > } } )\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ ( { { < { < > } > } < { } > < < < [ < [ ] > ] > > > } } )>>>"
