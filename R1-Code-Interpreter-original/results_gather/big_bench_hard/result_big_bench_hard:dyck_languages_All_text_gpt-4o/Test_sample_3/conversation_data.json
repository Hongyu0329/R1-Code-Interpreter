    "To complete the sequence while ensuring that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and identify which brackets are open and need to be closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { }`\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - `<`: Open angle bracket.\n   - `[ ]`: Open and close square brackets. This pair is complete.\n   - `{`: Open curly brace.\n   - `<`: Open angle bracket.\n   - `( )`: Open and close parentheses. This pair is complete.\n   - `>`: Close angle bracket. This matches the second `<`.\n   - `}`: Close curly brace. This matches the first `{`.\n   - `[ ]`: Open and close square brackets. This pair is complete.\n   - `(`: Open parenthesis.\n   - `{ }`: Open and close curly braces. This pair is complete.\n\n3. **Unmatched Brackets**:\n   - The first `<` is unmatched and needs a closing `>`.\n   - The `(` is unmatched and needs a closing `)`.\n\n4. **Completing the Sequence**:\n   - To close the unmatched `<`, we add `>` at the end.\n   - To close the unmatched `(`, we add `)` at the end.\n\n5. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The final sequence, with all brackets properly closed, is: `< [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { } ) >`\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<< < [ ] { < ( ) > } [ ] ( { } ) > >>>"
