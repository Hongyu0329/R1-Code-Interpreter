    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and angle brackets are properly closed. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `< < [ ( ) ] >`\n\n2. **Understanding the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence starts with two opening angle brackets: `< <`.\n   - This is followed by an opening square bracket: `[`.\n   - Inside the square brackets, there is a pair of parentheses: `( )`.\n   - The square bracket is then closed: `]`.\n   - Finally, there is a closing angle bracket: `>`.\n\n3. **Current Status**:\n   - The sequence has two opening angle brackets `< <` and only one closing angle bracket `>`.\n   - This means there is one more opening angle bracket than closing angle brackets.\n\n4. **Balancing the Sequence**:\n   - To balance the sequence, we need to add one more closing angle bracket `>` to match the two opening angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The complete and balanced sequence should be: `< < [ ( ) ] > >`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all types of brackets are properly opened and closed.\n\n<<< < < [ ( ) ] > > >>>"
