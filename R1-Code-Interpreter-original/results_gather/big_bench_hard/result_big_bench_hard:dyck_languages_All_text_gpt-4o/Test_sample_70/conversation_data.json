    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. The sequence uses three types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, and angle brackets `<>`. The goal is to complete the sequence so that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `{ [ < [ < { < { } > } > ( ( < { [ ] } > { { } } ) { } ) ] > ]`\n\n2. **Identify Opening and Closing Brackets**:\n   - `{` is opened at the start.\n   - `[` is opened after `{`.\n   - `<` is opened after `[`.\n   - `[` is opened after `<`.\n   - `<` is opened after `[`.\n   - `{` is opened after `<`.\n   - `<` is opened after `{`.\n   - `{` is opened after `<`.\n   - `}` is closed after `{`, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `>` is closed after `}`, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `}` is closed after `>`, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `>` is closed after `}`, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `(` is opened after `>`.\n   - `(` is opened after `(`.\n   - `<` is opened after `(`.\n   - `{` is opened after `<`.\n   - `[` is opened after `{`.\n   - `]` is closed after `[`, matching the last opened `[`.\n   - `}` is closed after `]`, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `>` is closed after `}`, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `{` is opened after `>`.\n   - `{` is opened after `{`.\n   - `}` is closed after `{`, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `}` is closed after `}`, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `)` is closed after `}`, matching the last opened `(`.\n   - `{` is opened after `)`.\n   - `}` is closed after `{`, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `)` is closed after `}`, matching the last opened `(`.\n   - `]` is closed after `)`, matching the last opened `[`.\n   - `>` is closed after `]`, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `]` is closed after `>`, matching the last opened `[`.\n\n3. **Remaining Unmatched Opening Brackets**:\n   - The initial `{` is still unmatched.\n\n4. **Complete the Sequence**:\n   - To properly close the sequence, we need to close the unmatched `{` with a `}`.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n`{ [ < [ < { < { } > } > ( ( < { [ ] } > { { } } ) { } ) ] > ] }`\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<{ [ < [ < { < { } > } > ( ( < { [ ] } > { { } } ) { } ) ] > ] }>>>"
