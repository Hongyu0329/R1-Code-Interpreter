    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order and number of closing brackets required.\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - This is followed by an opening curly brace `{`.\n   - Another opening curly brace `{` follows.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets:**\n   - There is one closing curly brace `}` in the sequence.\n\n3. **Determine the Unmatched Opening Brackets:**\n   - We have one opening parenthesis `(` that is unmatched.\n   - We have two opening curly braces `{` and only one closing curly brace `}`. This means one curly brace `{` is unmatched.\n\n4. **Determine the Order of Closing Brackets:**\n   - The last unmatched opening bracket is `{`, so it should be closed first.\n   - After closing the unmatched `{`, we need to close the unmatched `(`.\n\n5. **Complete the Sequence:**\n   - Add a closing curly brace `}` to match the second opening `{`.\n   - Add a closing parenthesis `)` to match the opening `(`.\n\n6. **Final Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence should be: `( { { } } )`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( { { } } )>>>"
