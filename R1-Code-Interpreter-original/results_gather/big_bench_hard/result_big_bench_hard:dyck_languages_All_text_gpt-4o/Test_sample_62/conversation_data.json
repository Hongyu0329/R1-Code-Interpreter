    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The sequence uses the following types of symbols:\n\n- Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n- Angle brackets: `<` and `>`\n- Square brackets: `[` and `]`\n- Curly braces: `{` and `}`\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `( ( < [ { { } } ] > { } ) ( < > ) [ ( < > ) ] <`\n\n2. **Identify Unmatched Opening Symbols**:\n   - The sequence starts with `(`, which is closed by `)`.\n   - The next `(` is closed by the `)` after `{ }`.\n   - The `<` after the first `(` is closed by the `>` after `[ { { } } ]`.\n   - The `[` is closed by the `]` after `{ { } }`.\n   - The `{` is closed by the `}` after `{ }`.\n   - The `{` inside the `[` is closed by the `}` immediately after it.\n   - The `(` after the first `)` is closed by the `)` after `< >`.\n   - The `<` after the second `(` is closed by the `>` immediately after it.\n   - The `[` after the second `)` is closed by the `]` after `( < > )`.\n   - The `(` inside the `[` is closed by the `)` immediately after `< >`.\n   - The `<` inside the `[` is closed by the `>` immediately after it.\n   - The final `<` is not closed.\n\n3. **Determine the Closing Symbols Needed**:\n   - The final `<` needs a closing `>`.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence**:\n   - Add the necessary closing `>` at the end of the sequence to close the final `<`.\n\n5. **Final Completed Sequence**:\n   - `( ( < [ { { } } ] > { } ) ( < > ) [ ( < > ) ] < >`\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses is:\n\n<<<( ( < [ { { } } ] > { } ) ( < > ) [ ( < > ) ] < >>>"
