    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Input Sequence**: `[ [ < < { } >`\n\n2. **Understanding the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence consists of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, angle brackets `< >`, and curly braces `{ }`.\n   - Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - Start with the first character: `[`\n     - This is an opening square bracket. We need a closing `]` for this.\n   - Next character: `[`\n     - Another opening square bracket. We need another closing `]` for this.\n   - Next character: `<`\n     - This is an opening angle bracket. We need a closing `>` for this.\n   - Next character: `<`\n     - Another opening angle bracket. We need another closing `>` for this.\n   - Next character: `{`\n     - This is an opening curly brace. We need a closing `}` for this.\n   - Next character: `}`\n     - This is a closing curly brace. It matches the last opened `{`, so this pair is complete.\n   - Next character: `>`\n     - This is a closing angle bracket. It matches the last opened `<`, so this pair is complete.\n\n4. **Remaining Open Brackets**:\n   - After processing the given sequence, we have the following unmatched opening brackets:\n     - One `<` (from the second `<`)\n     - Two `[` (from the two `[` at the beginning)\n\n5. **Closing the Remaining Brackets**:\n   - We need to close the remaining `<` with a `>`.\n   - We need to close the two `[` with two `]`.\n\n6. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The completed sequence should be: `[ [ < < { } > > ] ]`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ [ < < { } > > ] ]>>>"
