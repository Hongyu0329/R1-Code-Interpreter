    "To complete the sequence and ensure that the parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order and type of closing brackets needed. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Brackets:**\n   - The input sequence is: `( < >`\n   - We have an opening parenthesis `(`, an opening angle bracket `<`, and a closing angle bracket `>`.\n\n2. **Determine the Order of Closing:**\n   - The sequence of opening brackets is: `(` and `<`.\n   - The sequence of closing brackets should be in the reverse order of opening brackets to ensure proper closure.\n\n3. **Close the Angle Bracket:**\n   - The angle bracket `<` is already closed by the `>` in the input. So, the angle brackets are properly closed.\n\n4. **Close the Parenthesis:**\n   - The opening parenthesis `(` needs to be closed. We need to add a closing parenthesis `)`.\n\n5. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - The input sequence is `( < >`.\n   - The angle brackets are already closed.\n   - We need to add a closing parenthesis `)` to close the opening parenthesis.\n\n6. **Final Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence is `( < > )`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( < > )>>>"
