    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and nested. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing characters:**\n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Brackets: `[` and `]`\n   - Braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n2. **Analyze the sequence:**\n   - Start with the first character and move through the sequence, keeping track of the opening characters using a stack data structure.\n   - For each opening character, push it onto the stack.\n   - For each closing character, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is not properly nested.\n\n3. **Given sequence:**\n   - `[ { ( { } ) } < < ( ) { { < [ { [ ( ) ] } ] > } } > >`\n\n4. **Step-by-step analysis:**\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `}`: Matches top of stack `{`, pop stack.\n   - `)`: Matches top of stack `(`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches top of stack `{`, pop stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `)`: Matches top of stack `(`, pop stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `)`: Matches top of stack `(`, pop stack.\n   - `]`: Matches top of stack `[`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches top of stack `{`, pop stack.\n   - `]`: Matches top of stack `[`, pop stack.\n   - `>`: Matches top of stack `<`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches top of stack `{`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches top of stack `{`, pop stack.\n   - `>`: Matches top of stack `<`, pop stack.\n   - `>`: Matches top of stack `<`, pop stack.\n\n5. **Final check:**\n   - After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if all opening characters have been properly closed.\n\nThe sequence is properly nested and closed. Therefore, the sequence is complete as given.\n\n<<<[ { ( { } ) } < < ( ) { { < [ { [ ( ) ] } ] > } } > >>>"
