    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence step by step. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing brackets:**\n   - Opening brackets: `(`, `<`, `{`, `(`, `{`, `(`, `<`\n   - Closing brackets: `)`, `}`, `}`, `)`, `>`\n\n2. **Match the brackets:**\n   - The first opening bracket is `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - The second opening bracket is `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n   - The third opening bracket is `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - The fourth opening bracket is `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - The fifth opening bracket is `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - The sixth opening bracket is `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - The seventh opening bracket is `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n\n3. **Analyze the given sequence:**\n   - The sequence starts with `(`, followed by `<`, then `{`, then `(`, then `)`, then `{`, then `}`, then `}`, then `(`, then `<`, then `>`, then `)`, then `>`.\n   - The sequence so far is: `( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) >`\n\n4. **Determine the missing closing brackets:**\n   - The sequence ends with `>`, which closes the `<` that was opened just before it.\n   - The `)` before the last `>` closes the `(` that was opened just before the `<`.\n   - The `}` before the `(` closes the `{` that was opened before the `(`.\n   - The `}` before the `}` closes the `{` that was opened before the `(`.\n   - The `)` after the first `{` closes the `(` that was opened before the `{`.\n   - The `}` after the `(` closes the `{` that was opened before the `(`.\n   - The `<` after the first `(` needs a closing `>`.\n   - The first `(` needs a closing `)`.\n\n5. **Complete the sequence:**\n   - The sequence needs to be completed by adding the missing closing brackets in the correct order.\n   - After the last `>`, we need to add `)`, which closes the first `(`.\n\n6. **Final sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence is: `( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) > )`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) > )>>>"
