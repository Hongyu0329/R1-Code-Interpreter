    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order of closing each type of bracket. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `<`, which is an opening angle bracket.\n   - Next, we have `(`, which is an opening parenthesis.\n   - Another `(` follows, which is another opening parenthesis.\n   - Then, `{` is an opening curly brace.\n   - Finally, `<` is another opening angle bracket.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets:**\n   - The sequence contains `>`, which is a closing angle bracket.\n   - Then, `}` is a closing curly brace.\n\n3. **Determine the Order of Closing:**\n   - The last opened bracket that hasn't been closed yet is `<`. It is closed by `>`.\n   - Next, `{` was opened before the last `<`, and it is closed by `}`.\n   - After closing the curly brace, we need to close the parentheses. The last opened parenthesis is `(`, which needs to be closed by `)`.\n   - The next parenthesis `(` also needs to be closed by `)`.\n   - Finally, the first opened angle bracket `<` needs to be closed by `>`.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - We start with the given sequence: `< ( ( { < > }`\n   - Close the last opened `<` with `>`.\n   - Close the `{` with `}`.\n   - Close the last `(` with `)`.\n   - Close the first `(` with `)`.\n   - Close the first `<` with `>`.\n\n5. **Final Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence is: `< ( ( { < > } ) ) >`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < ( ( { < > } ) ) > >>>"
