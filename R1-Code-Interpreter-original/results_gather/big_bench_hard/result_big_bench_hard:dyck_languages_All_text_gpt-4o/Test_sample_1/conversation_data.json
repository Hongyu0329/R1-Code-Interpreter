    "To complete the sequence \"< [ [\", we need to ensure that all the parentheses are closed properly. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening symbols**: \n   - The sequence starts with \"<\", which is an opening angle bracket.\n   - Next, we have \"[\", which is an opening square bracket.\n   - Finally, we have another \"[\", which is another opening square bracket.\n\n2. **Determine the closing order**:\n   - In order to close the sequence properly, we need to close the brackets in the reverse order of their opening. This is because the sequence follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure, similar to a stack.\n   - The last opened bracket is \"[\", so it should be closed first with a \"]\".\n   - The next bracket to close is the previous \"[\", which should also be closed with a \"]\".\n   - Finally, the first opened bracket \"<\" should be closed with a \">\".\n\n3. **Construct the completed sequence**:\n   - Start with the given sequence: \"< [ [\"\n   - Close the last opened bracket: \"< [ [ ]\"\n   - Close the next bracket: \"< [ [ ] ]\"\n   - Close the first bracket: \"< [ [ ] ] >\"\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all the brackets are closed properly and in the correct order.\n\nThe final completed sequence is:\n\n<<< < [ [ ] ] > >>>"
