    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order of closing each type of bracket. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `<`, which is an angle bracket.\n   - This is followed by three opening parentheses `(`.\n   - Next, we have an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - Finally, there is an opening curly brace `{`.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets:**\n   - The sequence already contains a closing curly brace `}`.\n   - This is followed by a closing square bracket `]`.\n\n3. **Determine the Order of Closing:**\n   - Brackets must be closed in the reverse order of their opening. This means the last opened bracket should be closed first.\n   - The last opened bracket is `{`, which is already closed by `}`.\n   - Next, the square bracket `[` is closed by `]`.\n   - Now, we need to close the three opening parentheses `(`.\n   - Finally, we need to close the angle bracket `<`.\n\n4. **Construct the Complete Sequence:**\n   - The sequence starts with `< ( ( ( [ { } ] )`.\n   - After the closing square bracket `]`, we need to add three closing parentheses `)`.\n   - Finally, we close the angle bracket with `>`.\n\n5. **Final Sequence:**\n   - The complete sequence with all brackets properly closed is: `< ( ( ( [ { } ] ) ) ) >`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < ( ( ( [ { } ] ) ) ) > >>>"
