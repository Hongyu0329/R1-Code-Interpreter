    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence step by step. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`. Each type of bracket must be opened and closed in the correct order, following the last-in, first-out principle.\n\n1. **Initial Analysis**: \n   - The sequence starts with an open parenthesis `(`.\n   - It is followed by an open square bracket `[`.\n   - Then, another open square bracket `[`.\n   - Next, an open curly brace `{`.\n   - An open angle bracket `<` follows.\n   - Then, a close angle bracket `>`.\n   - Two open curly braces `{` follow.\n   - Four open angle brackets `<` follow.\n   - An open curly brace `{` follows.\n   - A close curly brace `}` follows.\n   - A close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - Another close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - An open parenthesis `(` follows.\n   - An open angle bracket `<` follows.\n   - An open parenthesis `(` follows.\n   - Another open parenthesis `(` follows.\n   - A close parenthesis `)` follows.\n   - Another close parenthesis `)` follows.\n   - An open square bracket `[` follows.\n   - An open parenthesis `(` follows.\n   - An open square bracket `[` follows.\n   - A close square bracket `]` follows.\n   - A close parenthesis `)` follows.\n   - A close square bracket `]` follows.\n   - A close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - A close parenthesis `)` follows.\n   - A close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - A close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - An open curly brace `{` follows.\n   - A close curly brace `}` follows.\n   - A close square bracket `]` follows.\n   - An open square bracket `[` follows.\n   - An open angle bracket `<` follows.\n   - An open angle bracket `<` follows.\n   - A close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - A close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - A close square bracket `]` follows.\n   - An open angle bracket `<` follows.\n   - An open parenthesis `(` follows.\n   - A close parenthesis `)` follows.\n   - A close angle bracket `>` follows.\n   - A close square bracket `]` follows.\n   - A close parenthesis `)` follows.\n\n2. **Checking for Proper Closure**:\n   - We need to ensure that each type of bracket is properly closed in the reverse order of their opening.\n   - The sequence ends with a close parenthesis `)`, which matches the first open parenthesis `(`.\n   - The second last character is a close square bracket `]`, which matches the first open square bracket `[`.\n   - The third last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the first open angle bracket `<`.\n   - The fourth last character is a close square bracket `]`, which matches the second open square bracket `[`.\n   - The fifth last character is a close curly brace `}`, which matches the first open curly brace `{`.\n   - The sixth last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the second open angle bracket `<`.\n   - The seventh last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the third open angle bracket `<`.\n   - The eighth last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the fourth open angle bracket `<`.\n   - The ninth last character is a close curly brace `}`, which matches the second open curly brace `{`.\n   - The tenth last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the fifth open angle bracket `<`.\n   - The eleventh last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the sixth open angle bracket `<`.\n   - The twelfth last character is a close curly brace `}`, which matches the third open curly brace `{`.\n   - The thirteenth last character is a close square bracket `]`, which matches the third open square bracket `[`.\n   - The fourteenth last character is a close parenthesis `)`, which matches the second open parenthesis `(`.\n   - The fifteenth last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the seventh open angle bracket `<`.\n   - The sixteenth last character is a close parenthesis `)`, which matches the third open parenthesis `(`.\n   - The seventeenth last character is a close parenthesis `)`, which matches the fourth open parenthesis `(`.\n   - The eighteenth last character is a close angle bracket `>`, which matches the eighth open angle bracket `<`.\n   -
