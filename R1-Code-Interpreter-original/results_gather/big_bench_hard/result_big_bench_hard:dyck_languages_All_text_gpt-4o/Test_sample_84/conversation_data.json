    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and angle brackets are properly closed. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Input Sequence**: ( { } ) < { < { } >\n\n2. **Analyze the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence starts with a parenthesis `(`, which is closed by `)`.\n   - Inside the parenthesis, there is a pair of curly braces `{ }`, which are already closed.\n   - After the parenthesis, there is an angle bracket `<`, which needs to be closed.\n   - Inside the angle bracket, there is a pair of curly braces `{ }`, which are already closed.\n   - After the curly braces, there is another angle bracket `<`, which needs to be closed.\n   - Inside this angle bracket, there is a pair of curly braces `{ }`, which are already closed.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Closures**:\n   - The first angle bracket `<` is not closed in the sequence.\n   - The second angle bracket `<` is also not closed in the sequence.\n\n4. **Complete the Sequence**:\n   - Close the second angle bracket with `>`.\n   - Close the first angle bracket with `>`.\n\n5. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The completed sequence should be: ( { } ) < { < { } > >\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( { } ) < { < { } > >>>"
