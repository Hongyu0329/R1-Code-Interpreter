    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Opening Brackets:**\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened again.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n\n2. **Closing Brackets:**\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n\n3. **Remaining Open Brackets:**\n   - We have the following open brackets that need to be closed in reverse order of their opening:\n     - `[`\n     - `{`\n     - `{`\n\n4. **Closing the Remaining Brackets:**\n   - Close the `[` with `]`.\n   - Close the second `{` with `}`.\n   - Close the first `{` with `}`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `{ { [ { < { } > } ( ) ] } }`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ { [ { < { } > } ( ) ] } }>>>"
