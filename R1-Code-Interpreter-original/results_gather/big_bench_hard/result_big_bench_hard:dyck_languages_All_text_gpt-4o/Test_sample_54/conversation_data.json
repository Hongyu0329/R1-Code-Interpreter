    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and matched in the given sequence. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing symbols:**\n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Brackets: `[` and `]`\n   - Braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n2. **Track the sequence:**\n   - We start with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - Next, we have an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - Then, an opening brace `{`.\n   - Followed by another opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - Then, an opening brace `{`.\n   - A closing brace `}` follows, which matches the last opened brace.\n   - An opening angle bracket `>`, which matches the last opened angle bracket.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - An opening bracket `[` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - An opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - A closing angle bracket `>` matches the last opened angle bracket.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing angle bracket `>` matches the last opened angle bracket.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - An opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - An opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - An opening brace `{`.\n   - An opening bracket `[`.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing angle bracket `>` matches the last opened angle bracket.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing angle bracket `>` matches the last opened angle bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing bracket `]` matches the last opened bracket.\n   - A closing parenthesis `)` matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing brace `}` matches the last opened brace.\n   - A closing angle bracket `>` matches the last opened angle bracket.\n\n3. **Final check:**\n   - Ensure all opened symbols have corresponding closing symbols.\n   - The sequence is balanced and all symbols are properly closed.\n\nThe sequence is already complete and balanced. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>"
