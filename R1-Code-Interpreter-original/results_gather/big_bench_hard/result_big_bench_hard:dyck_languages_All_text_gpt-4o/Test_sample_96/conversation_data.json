    "To complete the sequence \"< < { } >\", we need to ensure that all the parentheses are closed properly. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing symbols:**\n   - The sequence contains the following symbols: `<`, `<`, `{`, `}`, `>`.\n   - `<` and `{` are opening symbols.\n   - `>` and `}` are closing symbols.\n\n2. **Match the opening and closing symbols:**\n   - The first `<` needs a corresponding `>`.\n   - The second `<` also needs a corresponding `>`.\n   - The `{` needs a corresponding `}`.\n\n3. **Check the current sequence:**\n   - The sequence is: `< < { } >`.\n   - The `{` is already closed by `}`.\n   - The second `<` is closed by the `>`.\n   - The first `<` is not yet closed.\n\n4. **Determine the missing closing symbol:**\n   - Since the first `<` is not closed, we need to add a `>` at the end of the sequence to close it.\n\n5. **Construct the completed sequence:**\n   - Add a `>` at the end of the sequence to close the first `<`.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `< < { } > >`.\n\n<<< < < { } > > >>>"
