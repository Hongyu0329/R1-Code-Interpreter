    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and other symbols are properly closed in the sequence. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: round brackets `()`, square brackets `[]`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and they must be properly nested.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing brackets**: \n   - Opening brackets: `(`, `[`, `{`, `<`\n   - Closing brackets: `)`, `]`, `}`, `>`\n\n2. **Track the sequence**: \n   - We start with an opening `(`, followed by another `(`, and another `(`.\n   - Then we have `[`, `<`, `[`, `<`, `[`, `(`, `[`, `{`, `<`, `(`, `<`, `(`.\n   - We encounter two closing `)`, which match the last two opening `(`.\n   - Next, we have `{ }`, which match the last opening `{`.\n   - Then `[ ]`, which match the last opening `[`.\n   - We have `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - Then `)`, which matches the last opening `(`.\n   - Next, `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - Then `}`, which matches the last opening `{`.\n   - Next, `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - We have `)`, which matches the last opening `(`.\n   - Then `{ < > }`, which match the last opening `{`.\n   - Next, `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - Then `[`, `<`, `[`, `{`, `(`, `<`, `<`, `{`, `{`, `[`, `<`, `{`, `[`, `[`.\n   - We have `< >`, which match the last opening `<`.\n   - Then `[ ]`, which match the last opening `[`.\n   - Next, `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - Then `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - Next, `}`, which matches the last opening `{`.\n   - Then `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - Next, `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - Then `{ { } }`, which match the last opening `{`.\n   - Next, `}`, which matches the last opening `{`.\n   - Then `}`, which matches the last opening `{`.\n   - Next, `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - Then `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - Next, `)`, which matches the last opening `(`.\n   - Then `}`, which matches the last opening `{`.\n   - Next, `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - Then `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - Next, `{ < > { } }`, which match the last opening `{`.\n   - Then `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - Next, `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - Then `(`, `[ ]`, which match the last opening `[`.\n   - Next, `)`, which matches the last opening `(`.\n   - Then `]`, which matches the last opening `[`.\n   - Finally, `>`, which matches the last opening `<`.\n   - We have `)`, which matches the last opening `(`.\n   - Finally, `)`, which matches the last opening `(`.\n\n3. **Ensure all brackets are closed**: \n   - After matching all the brackets, we ensure that there are no unmatched opening brackets left.\n\nThe sequence is now complete and all brackets are properly closed and nested.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
