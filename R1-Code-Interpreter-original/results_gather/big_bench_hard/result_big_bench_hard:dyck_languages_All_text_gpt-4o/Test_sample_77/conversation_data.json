    "To complete the sequence while ensuring that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and determine the necessary closing brackets for each type of opening bracket. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Brackets:**\n   - The sequence contains three types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, and parentheses `( )`.\n   - The sequence given is: `< < [ ] > ( < > ) <`.\n\n2. **Track the Opening and Closing of Each Bracket Type:**\n   - Start with an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n   - Traverse the sequence from left to right, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when a corresponding closing bracket is encountered.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - `<`: Push onto the stack. Stack: `<`\n   - `<`: Push onto the stack. Stack: `< <`\n   - `[`: Push onto the stack. Stack: `< < [`\n   - `]`: Pop from the stack. Stack: `< <`\n   - `>`: Pop from the stack. Stack: `<`\n   - `(`: Push onto the stack. Stack: `< (`\n   - `<`: Push onto the stack. Stack: `< ( <`\n   - `>`: Pop from the stack. Stack: `< (`\n   - `)`: Pop from the stack. Stack: `<`\n   - `<`: Push onto the stack. Stack: `< <`\n\n4. **Determine the Missing Closing Brackets:**\n   - After processing the entire sequence, the stack contains two `<` brackets.\n   - Each `<` requires a corresponding `>` to close it.\n\n5. **Complete the Sequence:**\n   - Add two `>` to the end of the sequence to close the remaining `<` brackets.\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The completed sequence is: `< < [ ] > ( < > ) < > >`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < < [ ] > ( < > ) < > > >>>"
