    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>`. Each type of bracket must be closed in the reverse order of how they were opened.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `( ( ( ( [ [ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ] ] ( ) ) )`\n\n2. **Identify Open Brackets**:\n   - 4 opening parentheses: `(` at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - 2 opening square brackets: `[` at positions 5 and 6.\n   - 1 opening angle bracket: `<` at position 7.\n   - 1 opening square bracket: `[` at position 8.\n   - 2 opening curly braces: `{` at positions 9 and 10.\n   - 1 opening square bracket: `[` at position 11.\n\n3. **Identify Closed Brackets**:\n   - 1 closing square bracket: `]` at position 12.\n   - 2 closing curly braces: `}` at positions 13 and 14.\n   - 1 closing square bracket: `]` at position 15.\n   - 1 closing angle bracket: `>` at position 16.\n   - 2 closing square brackets: `]` at positions 17 and 18.\n   - 1 closing parenthesis: `)` at position 19.\n   - 1 closing parenthesis: `)` at position 20.\n\n4. **Remaining Open Brackets**:\n   - 3 opening parentheses: `(` at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\n5. **Closing the Remaining Brackets**:\n   - We need to close the remaining 3 opening parentheses with 3 closing parentheses `)`.\n\n6. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The sequence with all brackets properly closed is: `( ( ( ( [ [ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ] ] ( ) ) ) ) ) )`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> ( ( ( ( [ [ < [ { { [ ] } } ] > ] ] ( ) ) ) ) ) )"
