    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct closing sequence. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Symbols**: \n   - The input sequence is `{ < <`.\n   - We have three opening symbols: one curly brace `{` and two angle brackets `<`.\n\n2. **Determine the Closing Order**:\n   - In a properly nested sequence, the last opened symbol should be the first to close. This is similar to a stack data structure where the last element added is the first one to be removed (Last In, First Out - LIFO).\n   - Therefore, the closing sequence should be the reverse of the opening sequence.\n\n3. **Match Each Opening Symbol with Its Closing Counterpart**:\n   - The opening curly brace `{` should be closed with a closing curly brace `}`.\n   - Each opening angle bracket `<` should be closed with a closing angle bracket `>`.\n\n4. **Construct the Closing Sequence**:\n   - The last opened symbol is `<`, so it should be closed first with `>`.\n   - The next opened symbol is also `<`, so it should be closed next with `>`.\n   - The first opened symbol is `{`, so it should be closed last with `}`.\n\n5. **Combine the Opening and Closing Sequences**:\n   - The complete sequence is the original input followed by the closing sequence.\n   - Original input: `{ < <`\n   - Closing sequence: `> > }`\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - Combine the sequences to get the final properly closed sequence: `{ < < > > }`\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence with properly closed parentheses is:\n\n<<<{ < < > > }>>>"
