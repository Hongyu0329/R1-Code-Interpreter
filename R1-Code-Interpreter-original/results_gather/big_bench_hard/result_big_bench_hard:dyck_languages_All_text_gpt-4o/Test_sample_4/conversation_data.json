    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Input**: `< ( ( ( < > ) ) ( { { } [ { } ] [ ] < ( ) > } ) )`\n\n2. **Identify the Opening and Closing Pairs**:\n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Brackets: `[` and `]`\n   - Braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle Brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n3. **Analyze the Sequence**:\n   - Start with the first character `<`, which is an opening angle bracket.\n   - Next, we have `(`, an opening parenthesis.\n   - Followed by another `(`, another opening parenthesis.\n   - Another `(`, yet another opening parenthesis.\n   - Then `<`, an opening angle bracket.\n   - Next, `>`, a closing angle bracket. This closes the last opened angle bracket.\n   - Then `)`, a closing parenthesis. This closes the last opened parenthesis.\n   - Another `)`, closing the next parenthesis.\n   - Another `)`, closing the next parenthesis.\n   - Next, `(`, an opening parenthesis.\n   - Then `{`, an opening brace.\n   - Another `{`, another opening brace.\n   - Then `}`, a closing brace. This closes the last opened brace.\n   - Next, `[`, an opening bracket.\n   - Then `{`, an opening brace.\n   - Then `}`, a closing brace. This closes the last opened brace.\n   - Next, `]`, a closing bracket. This closes the last opened bracket.\n   - Another `[`, an opening bracket.\n   - Then `]`, a closing bracket. This closes the last opened bracket.\n   - Next, `<`, an opening angle bracket.\n   - Then `(`, an opening parenthesis.\n   - Then `)`, a closing parenthesis. This closes the last opened parenthesis.\n   - Next, `>`, a closing angle bracket. This closes the last opened angle bracket.\n   - Then `}`, a closing brace. This closes the last opened brace.\n   - Finally, `)`, a closing parenthesis. This closes the last opened parenthesis.\n\n4. **Check for Completeness**:\n   - All opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols.\n   - The sequence is complete and properly nested.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The sequence is already complete and properly closed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < ( ( ( < > ) ) ( { { } [ { } ] [ ] < ( ) > } ) ) >>>"
