    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `[ [ < [ ] > ] ] <`\n\n2. **Understanding the Structure**:\n   - The sequence starts with an outer square bracket `[`.\n   - Inside the first square bracket, there is another square bracket `[`.\n   - Inside this second square bracket, there is an angle bracket `<`.\n   - Inside the angle bracket, there is a pair of square brackets `[ ]`.\n   - After the inner square brackets, there is a closing angle bracket `>`.\n   - This completes the inner angle bracket structure `< [ ] >`.\n   - The sequence then closes the second square bracket with `]`.\n   - This completes the second square bracket structure `[ < [ ] > ]`.\n   - The sequence then closes the first square bracket with `]`.\n   - This completes the outer square bracket structure `[ [ < [ ] > ] ]`.\n   - Finally, there is an opening angle bracket `<` at the end.\n\n3. **Identifying the Problem**:\n   - The sequence ends with an opening angle bracket `<` that is not closed.\n\n4. **Completing the Sequence**:\n   - To properly close the sequence, we need to add a closing angle bracket `>` at the end.\n\n5. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The completed sequence is `[ [ < [ ] > ] ] < >`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all brackets are properly opened and closed.\n\n<<<[ [ < [ ] > ] ] < >>>"
