    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and identify the opening and closing pairs of brackets, braces, and parentheses. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, angle brackets `<>`, and parentheses `()`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets:**\n   - `{` is the first opening bracket.\n   - `[` is the second opening bracket.\n   - `<` is the third opening bracket.\n   - `[` is the fourth opening bracket.\n   - `{` is the fifth opening bracket.\n   - `<` is the sixth opening bracket.\n   - `(` is the seventh opening bracket.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets:**\n   - `)` is the first closing bracket, which matches the last opened `(`.\n   - `>` is the second closing bracket, which matches the last opened `<`.\n   - `}` is the third closing bracket, which matches the last opened `{`.\n   - `]` is the fourth closing bracket, which matches the last opened `[`.\n   - `>` is the fifth closing bracket, which matches the last opened `<`.\n\n3. **Remaining Open Brackets:**\n   - After processing the given sequence, the remaining open brackets are `{` and `[`. These need to be closed in the reverse order of their opening.\n\n4. **Close the Remaining Brackets:**\n   - The last opened bracket that hasn't been closed is `[`, so we close it with `]`.\n   - The next opened bracket that hasn't been closed is `{`, so we close it with `}`.\n\n### Final Sequence Completion:\n\nThe sequence is completed by adding the necessary closing brackets to match each opening bracket in the reverse order of their appearance.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `{ [ < [ { < ( ) > } ] > ] }`\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe final answer, with the sequence properly completed, is:\n\n<<<{ [ < [ { < ( ) > } ] > ] }>>>"
