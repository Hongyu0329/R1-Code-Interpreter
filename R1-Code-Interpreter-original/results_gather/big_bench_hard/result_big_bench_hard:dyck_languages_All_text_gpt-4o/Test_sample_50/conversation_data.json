    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and determine the correct closing order for each type of bracket. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: parentheses `()`, angle brackets `<>`, and square brackets `[]`.\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - Next, there is an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - Then, another opening angle bracket `>`, which is actually a closing bracket. This indicates that the angle bracket opened by `<` is closed here.\n   - Next, there is an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - Then, an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - Finally, another opening parenthesis `(`.\n\n2. **Determine the closing order:**\n   - The last opened bracket is a parenthesis `(`, so it should be closed first with `)`.\n   - Before that, a square bracket `[` was opened, so it should be closed next with `]`.\n   - Before the square bracket, a parenthesis `(` was opened, so it should be closed next with `)`.\n   - The angle bracket `<` was already closed by `>`, so no further action is needed for it.\n   - Finally, the first opening parenthesis `(` should be closed with `)`.\n\n3. **Construct the completed sequence:**\n   - Start with the given sequence: `( < > ( [ ( )`\n   - Close the last opened parenthesis: `( < > ( [ ( ) )`\n   - Close the square bracket: `( < > ( [ ( ) ] )`\n   - Close the parenthesis before the square bracket: `( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )`\n   - The angle bracket is already closed, so no further action is needed.\n   - Close the first opening parenthesis: `( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )`\n\nThe completed sequence with all brackets properly closed is: `( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( < > ( [ ( ) ] ) )>>>"
