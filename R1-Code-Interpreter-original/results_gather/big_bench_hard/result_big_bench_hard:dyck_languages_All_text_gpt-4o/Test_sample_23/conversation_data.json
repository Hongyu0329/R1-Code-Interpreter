    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order of closing brackets. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ]`.\n   - The opening brackets are: `<`, `{`, `<`, `[`, `[`, `(`, and `{`.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets:**\n   - The sequence already contains a pair of `{ }` within the parentheses, which is correctly closed.\n   - We need to close the remaining opening brackets in the reverse order of their opening.\n\n3. **Determine the Order of Closing:**\n   - The last opened bracket that is not closed is `(`, so we close it first with `)`.\n   - Next, we have two `[` brackets that need to be closed, so we close them with `]` and `]`.\n   - Then, we have `<` that needs to be closed, so we close it with `>`.\n   - Next, we have `{` that needs to be closed, so we close it with `}`.\n   - Finally, we have the outermost `<` that needs to be closed, so we close it with `>`.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - Starting with the given sequence: `< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ]`\n   - Add the closing brackets in the determined order: `) ] ] > } >`\n\n5. **Final Sequence:**\n   - Combine the initial sequence with the closing brackets: `< { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] ) ] ] > } >`\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence with all parentheses properly closed is:\n\n<<< < { < [ [ ( { } ) ] ] ) ] ] > } > >>>"
