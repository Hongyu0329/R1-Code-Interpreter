    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the necessary steps to achieve a balanced sequence.\n\n1. **Identify the Input**: The input sequence is `< ( ( )`.\n\n2. **Count the Parentheses**:\n   - Opening parentheses `(`: 2\n   - Closing parentheses `)`: 1\n\n3. **Balance the Parentheses**:\n   - To balance the parentheses, the number of opening and closing parentheses must be equal. Currently, there is one more opening parenthesis than closing parentheses.\n   - Therefore, we need to add one more closing parenthesis `)` to balance the sequence.\n\n4. **Consider the Angle Bracket**:\n   - The angle bracket `<` is an opening bracket and should be closed with a corresponding closing angle bracket `>`.\n   - Currently, there is no closing angle bracket in the sequence, so we need to add one.\n\n5. **Construct the Balanced Sequence**:\n   - Start with the given sequence: `< ( ( )`\n   - Add one closing parenthesis `)` to balance the parentheses: `< ( ( ) )`\n   - Add one closing angle bracket `>` to balance the angle brackets: `< ( ( ) ) >`\n\n6. **Verify the Balanced Sequence**:\n   - Check that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n   - The sequence `< ( ( ) ) >` is now balanced with:\n     - One opening angle bracket `<` and one closing angle bracket `>`.\n     - Two opening parentheses `(` and two closing parentheses `)`.\n\nThe final balanced sequence is:\n\n<<< < ( ( ) ) > >>>"
