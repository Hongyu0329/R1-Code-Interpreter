    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and nested. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing symbols:**\n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Brackets: `[` and `]`\n   - Braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n2. **Analyze the sequence:**\n   - Start with the first character and move through the sequence, keeping track of the opening symbols using a stack data structure.\n   - For each opening symbol, push it onto the stack.\n   - For each closing symbol, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the sequence is not properly nested.\n\n3. **Step-by-step analysis:**\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `>`: Matches `<`, pop stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `]`: Matches `[`, pop stack.\n   - `>`: Matches `<`, pop stack.\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `>`: Matches `<`, pop stack.\n   - `]`: Matches `[`, pop stack.\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `)`: Matches `(`, pop stack.\n   - `]`: Matches `[`, pop stack.\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `]`: Matches `[`, pop stack.\n   - `[`: Push onto stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `)`: Matches `(`, pop stack.\n   - `]`: Matches `[`, pop stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `)`: Matches `(`, pop stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `)`: Matches `(`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `(`: Push onto stack.\n   - `{`: Push onto stack.\n   - `<`: Push onto stack.\n   - `>`: Matches `<`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `)`: Matches `(`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n   - `>`: Matches `<`, pop stack.\n   - `}`: Matches `{`, pop stack.\n\n4. **Final check:**\n   - After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if all symbols are properly closed and nested.\n\nThe sequence is already complete and properly nested. Therefore, the final answer is the same as the input sequence.\n\n<<<[ { < > < [ ] > [ < { } > ] [ ( { } ) ] [ ] [ ( ) ] ( ) < { { < { { { { { ( { } ) } ( { < > } ) } } } } > } }>>>"
