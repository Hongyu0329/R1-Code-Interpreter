    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Parentheses:**\n   - The sequence starts with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - Next, there is an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - Then, there is another opening parenthesis `(`.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Parentheses:**\n   - The sequence ends with a closing parenthesis `)`.\n\n3. **Determine the Correct Order of Closing:**\n   - Parentheses must be closed in the reverse order of their opening.\n   - The last opened parenthesis is `(`, which is already closed by the `)` at the end of the sequence.\n   - Next, we need to close the square bracket `[`.\n   - Finally, we need to close the first opening parenthesis `(`.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - Start with the given sequence: `( [ ( )`\n   - Close the square bracket: `]`\n   - Close the first parenthesis: `)`\n\n5. **Final Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence is: `( [ ( ) ] )`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( [ ( ) ] )>>>"
