    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets and their types:**\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `(` (parenthesis)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n\n2. **Identify the closing brackets and their types:**\n   - `]` (square bracket) closes the last `[`\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes `<`\n   - `}` (curly brace) closes the last `{`\n   - `]` (square bracket) closes the second `[`\n   - `]` (square bracket) closes the first `[`\n   - `}` (curly brace) closes the second `{`\n   - `)` (parenthesis) closes `(`\n   - `[` (square bracket) opens a new sequence\n   - `(` (parenthesis) opens a new sequence\n   - `<` (angle bracket) opens a new sequence\n   - `{` (curly brace) opens a new sequence\n   - `<` (angle bracket) opens a new sequence\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the last `<`\n   - `}` (curly brace) closes the last `{`\n   - `>` (angle bracket) closes the second `<`\n   - `)` (parenthesis) closes the second `(`\n   - `]` (square bracket) closes the second `[`\n\n3. **Determine the missing closing brackets:**\n   - The first `{` needs a closing `}`\n   - The second `{` needs a closing `}`\n   - The first `[` needs a closing `]`\n   - The first `(` needs a closing `)`\n\n4. **Complete the sequence by adding the necessary closing brackets in the correct order:**\n   - After the last `]`, we need to close the first `(` with `)`\n   - After that, we need to close the first `{` with `}`\n   - Finally, we need to close the outermost `{` with `}`\n\nBy following these steps, we can complete the sequence correctly.\n\n<<<{ { ( { [ [ { < [ ] > } ] ] } ) [ ( < { < > } > ) ] } }>>>"
