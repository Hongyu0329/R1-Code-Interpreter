    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order and type of closing brackets. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `<`, which is an opening angle bracket.\n   - Next, we have `[`, which is an opening square bracket.\n   - Then, we have another `<`, which is another opening angle bracket.\n\n2. **Identify the Closing Brackets:**\n   - The sequence contains `>`, which is a closing angle bracket. This matches the most recent opening angle bracket `<`.\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Unmatched Opening Brackets:**\n   - After matching the last `<` with `>`, we are left with the following unmatched opening brackets:\n     - `<` (the first one)\n     - `[` (the square bracket)\n\n4. **Close the Remaining Unmatched Opening Brackets:**\n   - The unmatched opening angle bracket `<` should be closed with `>`.\n   - The unmatched opening square bracket `[` should be closed with `]`.\n\n5. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - The original sequence is `< [ < > ]`.\n   - After closing the unmatched brackets, the completed sequence becomes `< [ < > ] >`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, with all parentheses properly closed, is:\n\n<<< < [ < > ] > >>>"
