    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and nested. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence Analysis:**\n   - The sequence starts with `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - Next is `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n   - Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Followed by another `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n   - Then `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - The `)` is closed immediately.\n   - Next is `>`, which closes the previous `<`.\n   - Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Followed by `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Followed by `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - Then `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - The `)` is closed immediately.\n   - The `}` is closed immediately.\n   - The `]` is closed immediately.\n   - The `}` is closed immediately.\n   - The `]` is closed immediately.\n   - The `]` is closed immediately.\n   - The `>` is closed immediately.\n   - Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Followed by `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - The `{}` is closed immediately.\n   - The `]` is closed immediately.\n   - Then `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - Followed by `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n   - Then `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - Followed by `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n   - Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Followed by `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - The `{}` is closed immediately.\n   - The `]` is closed immediately.\n   - The `>` is closed immediately.\n   - The `}` is closed immediately.\n   - The `>` is closed immediately.\n   - The `)` is closed immediately.\n   - The `)` is closed immediately.\n   - Then `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - Followed by `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - Then `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n   - Then `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - The `)` is closed immediately.\n   - The `>` is closed immediately.\n   - Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - The `]` is closed immediately.\n   - Then `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Followed by `<`, which needs a closing `>`.\n   - Then `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - Followed by `(`, which needs a closing `)`.\n   - The `)` is closed immediately.\n   - The `}` is closed immediately.\n   - The `>` is closed immediately.\n   - Then `]`, which needs a closing `]`.\n   - Followed by `{`, which needs a closing `}`.\n   - The `{}` is closed immediately.\n   - The `]` is closed immediately.\n\n2. **Final Completion:**\n   - The sequence ends with an open `[`, which needs a closing `]`.\n\nBy following the sequence and ensuring each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol, we can complete the sequence.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
