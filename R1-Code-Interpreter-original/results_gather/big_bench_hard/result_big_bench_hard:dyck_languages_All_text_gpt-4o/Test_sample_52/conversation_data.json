    "To solve the problem of completing the sequence \"< < ( < >\", we need to ensure that all the parentheses and angle brackets are properly closed. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `< < ( < >`\n\n2. **Understanding the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence starts with two opening angle brackets: `< <`.\n   - This is followed by an opening parenthesis: `(`.\n   - Then, there is another opening angle bracket: `<`.\n   - Finally, there is a closing angle bracket: `>`.\n\n3. **Closing the Sequence**:\n   - The closing angle bracket `>` matches the last opening angle bracket `<`. So, the sequence now looks like: `< < ( < >`.\n   - Next, we need to close the opening parenthesis `(`. We add a closing parenthesis `)` after the `>`. The sequence becomes: `< < ( < > )`.\n   - Finally, we need to close the two initial opening angle brackets `< <`. We add two closing angle brackets `>>` at the end. The sequence becomes: `< < ( < > ) >>`.\n\n4. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The complete sequence with all parentheses and angle brackets properly closed is: `< < ( < > ) >>`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < < ( < > ) >> >>>"
