    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Input Sequence**: ( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) }\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - The sequence starts with `(`, which is an opening parenthesis. We need a corresponding `)` to close it.\n   - The next character is another `(`, which also needs a corresponding `)`.\n   - The next character is `)`, which closes the second `(`.\n   - The next character is `)`, which closes the first `(`.\n   - The next character is `[`, which is an opening bracket. We need a corresponding `]` to close it.\n   - The next character is `{`, which is an opening brace. We need a corresponding `}` to close it.\n   - The next character is `(`, which is an opening parenthesis. We need a corresponding `)` to close it.\n   - The next character is `<`, which is an opening angle bracket. We need a corresponding `>` to close it.\n   - The next character is `>`, which closes the `<`.\n   - The next character is `)`, which closes the `(`.\n   - The sequence ends with `}`, which closes the `{`.\n\n3. **Unclosed Brackets**:\n   - We have an unclosed `[`. We need to add a `]` to close it.\n\n4. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The complete sequence with all brackets properly closed is: `( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]`\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The final answer, with all brackets properly closed, is:\n\n<<<( ( ) ) [ { ( < > ) } ]>>>"
