    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the sequence. The input sequence is:\n\n\\[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } >\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with an opening square bracket \\([ \\).\n   - Next, there is an opening parenthesis \\( ( \\).\n   - Then, there is an opening angle bracket \\( < \\).\n   - After that, there is an opening curly brace \\({ \\).\n   - Next, there is another opening square bracket \\([ \\).\n   - Finally, there is an opening parenthesis \\( ( \\).\n\n2. **Closing Brackets:**\n   - The first closing bracket is a parenthesis \\( ) \\), which matches the last opened parenthesis.\n   - The next closing bracket is a square bracket \\([ ] \\), which matches the last opened square bracket.\n   - The next closing bracket is a curly brace \\({ } \\), which matches the last opened curly brace.\n   - The sequence ends with an angle bracket \\( > \\), which matches the last opened angle bracket.\n\n3. **Remaining Open Brackets:**\n   - After matching the closing brackets, we are left with the following open brackets that need to be closed:\n     - An open parenthesis \\( ( \\)\n     - An open square bracket \\([ \\)\n\n4. **Closing the Remaining Brackets:**\n   - To properly close the remaining open brackets, we need to add:\n     - A closing parenthesis \\( ) \\) to match the open parenthesis.\n     - A closing square bracket \\([ ] \\) to match the open square bracket.\n\nBy adding these closing brackets, we ensure that all the brackets are properly closed in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n\\[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } > ) ]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[ ( < { [ ( ) ] } > ) ]>>>"
