    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, braces, and angle brackets are properly closed in the sequence. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `[ ] { ( ( < { ( ( ( { < > ( ) } ) ) [ { } ] { { ( ) } } ) } < > >`\n\n2. **Identify Open and Close Pairs**:\n   - Square brackets: `[ ]`\n   - Curly braces: `{ }`\n   - Parentheses: `( )`\n   - Angle brackets: `< >`\n\n3. **Analyze the Sequence**:\n   - Start with `[ ]`: This pair is already closed.\n   - Next, `{ ( ( < { ( ( ( { < > ( ) } ) ) [ { } ] { { ( ) } } ) } < > >`:\n     - `{` opens\n     - `(` opens\n     - `(` opens\n     - `<` opens\n     - `{` opens\n     - `(` opens\n     - `(` opens\n     - `(` opens\n     - `{` opens\n     - `< >` closes\n     - `( )` closes\n     - `}` closes\n     - `)` closes\n     - `)` closes\n     - `)` closes\n     - `[ { } ]` closes\n     - `{ { ( ) } }` closes\n     - `)` closes\n     - `}` closes\n     - `< >` closes\n     - `>` closes\n\n4. **Check for Unclosed Openings**:\n   - After closing the sequence, we need to ensure all opened symbols are closed.\n   - The sequence ends with `>`, which closes the last opened `<`.\n   - The sequence is properly closed as all opened symbols have corresponding closing symbols.\n\n5. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The sequence is already complete and properly closed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ ] { ( ( < { ( ( ( { < > ( ) } ) ) [ { } ] { { ( ) } } ) } < > >}>>>"
