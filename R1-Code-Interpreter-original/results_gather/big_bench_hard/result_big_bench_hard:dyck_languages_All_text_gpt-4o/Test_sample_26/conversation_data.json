    "To complete the sequence and ensure that the parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Symbols:**\n   - The sequence starts with two opening parentheses: `( (`.\n   - Then, there is an opening angle bracket: `<`.\n   - Finally, there is a closing angle bracket: `>`.\n\n2. **Determine the Current State:**\n   - We have two opening parentheses `(` that need to be closed.\n   - We have one opening angle bracket `<` that is closed by the `>`.\n\n3. **Balance the Symbols:**\n   - The angle brackets `<` and `>` are already balanced, as there is one opening `<` and one closing `>`.\n   - The parentheses `(` are not yet balanced. We have two opening parentheses `(`, so we need two closing parentheses `)` to balance them.\n\n4. **Complete the Sequence:**\n   - Since the angle brackets are already balanced, we only need to add two closing parentheses `)` to balance the opening parentheses.\n\n5. **Final Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence should be: `( ( < > ) )`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( ( < > ) )>>>"
