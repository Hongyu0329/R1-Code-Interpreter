    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed and nested. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `[ < [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ] > ] < ( ) > ( ( ( ) ) ) ( < >`\n\n2. **Identify the Opening and Closing Pairs**:\n   - Square brackets: `[ ]`\n   - Parentheses: `( )`\n   - Curly braces: `{ }`\n   - Angle brackets: `< >`\n\n3. **Analyze the Sequence**:\n   - Start with the outermost brackets and work inward.\n   - The sequence starts with `[`, so it must end with `]`.\n   - Inside the first `[`, we have `< [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ] >`.\n   - The `<` after `[` must be closed with `>`.\n   - Inside this `< >`, we have `[ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ]`.\n   - The `[ ]` is already closed.\n   - The `( )` is already closed.\n   - The `( ( { { } } ) )` is properly nested and closed.\n   - The `< { < > } >` is properly nested and closed.\n   - The `[ ]` is already closed.\n   - The outer `< >` is closed by the `>`.\n   - The outermost `[` is closed by the `]`.\n\n4. **Continue with the Remaining Sequence**:\n   - After the first `]`, we have `< ( ) > ( ( ( ) ) ) ( < >`.\n   - The `< ( ) >` is properly nested and closed.\n   - The `( ( ( ) ) )` is properly nested and closed.\n   - The `( < >` starts with `(` and `<`, so it must end with `> )`.\n\n5. **Complete the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence ends with `( < > )` to properly close the last opening `(` and `<`.\n\n6. **Final Sequence**:\n   - `[ < [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ] > ] < ( ) > ( ( ( ) ) ) ( < > )`\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<<[ < [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ] > ] < ( ) > ( ( ( ) ) ) ( < > )>>>"
