    "To solve this problem, we need to complete the sequence of brackets and parentheses, ensuring that all are properly closed. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: [ < < { } > < > > ( )\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - **[**: This is an opening bracket. We need a corresponding closing bracket **]**.\n   - **<**: This is an opening angle bracket. We need a corresponding closing angle bracket **>**.\n   - **<**: Another opening angle bracket. We need another closing angle bracket **>**.\n   - **{**: This is an opening curly brace. We need a corresponding closing curly brace **}**.\n   - **}**: This is a closing curly brace. It matches the last opened curly brace **{**.\n   - **>**: This is a closing angle bracket. It matches the last opened angle bracket **<**.\n   - **<**: This is another opening angle bracket. We need another closing angle bracket **>**.\n   - **>**: This is a closing angle bracket. It matches the last opened angle bracket **<**.\n   - **>**: This is a closing angle bracket. It matches the first opened angle bracket **<**.\n   - **(**: This is an opening parenthesis. We need a corresponding closing parenthesis **)**.\n   - **)**: This is a closing parenthesis. It matches the last opened parenthesis **(**.\n\n3. **Unmatched Opening Brackets**:\n   - After matching all possible pairs, we are left with one unmatched opening bracket **[**.\n\n4. **Final Completion**:\n   - To properly close all brackets, we need to add a closing bracket **]** at the end of the sequence.\n\n5. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The completed sequence is: [ < < { } > < > > ( ) ]\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question is:\n\n<<<[ < < { } > < > > ( ) ]>>>"
