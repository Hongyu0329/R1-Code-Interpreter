    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input sequence is `( < < < >`. This sequence consists of one parenthesis `(` and three less-than signs `<`, followed by one greater-than sign `>`.\n\n2. **Identify the Opening and Closing Symbols**:\n   - The opening symbols are `(` and `<`.\n   - The closing symbols are `)` and `>`.\n\n3. **Count the Symbols**:\n   - Opening symbols: 1 `(` and 3 `<`.\n   - Closing symbols: 1 `>`.\n\n4. **Determine the Required Closing Symbols**:\n   - For the parenthesis `(`, we need a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.\n   - For each `<`, we need a corresponding `>`.\n\n5. **Analyze the Current State**:\n   - We have 1 `(` that needs a `)`.\n   - We have 3 `<` that need 3 `>`.\n   - We currently have 1 `>`, which closes one of the `<`.\n\n6. **Calculate the Remaining Symbols Needed**:\n   - We need 2 more `>` to close the remaining 2 `<`.\n   - We need 1 `)` to close the `(`.\n\n7. **Construct the Completed Sequence**:\n   - Start with the given sequence: `( < < < >`.\n   - Add 2 more `>` to close the remaining `<`: `( < < < > > >`.\n   - Add 1 `)` to close the `(`: `( < < < > > > )`.\n\n8. **Verify the Completed Sequence**:\n   - The sequence now has 1 `(` and 1 `)`, which are balanced.\n   - The sequence has 3 `<` and 3 `>`, which are balanced.\n\nThe completed sequence with properly closed parentheses is: `( < < < > > > )`.\n\n<<<( < < < > > > )>>>"
