    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, curly braces `{ }`, square brackets `[ ]`, and parentheses `( )`. Each type of bracket must be closed in the reverse order of how they were opened.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Opening Brackets:**\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n\n2. **Closing Brackets:**\n   - `[` is closed.\n   - `}` is closed.\n   - `>` is closed.\n   - `}` is closed.\n   - `>` is closed.\n   - `)` is closed.\n   - `)` is closed.\n\n3. **Remaining Open Brackets:**\n   - `<` (from step 1)\n   - `{` (from step 1)\n   - `[` (from step 1)\n   - `[` (from step 1)\n   - `(` (from step 1)\n   - `(` (from step 1)\n\n4. **Closing the Remaining Brackets:**\n   - The last opened bracket is `<`, so we need to close it with `>`.\n   - The next opened bracket is `{`, so we need to close it with `}`.\n   - The next opened bracket is `[`, so we need to close it with `]`.\n   - The next opened bracket is `[`, so we need to close it with `]`.\n   - The next opened bracket is `(`, so we need to close it with `)`.\n   - The next opened bracket is `(`, so we need to close it with `)`.\n\nBy closing the remaining open brackets in the reverse order of their opening, we ensure that the sequence is properly balanced.\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<<< { } [ [ ( ( < { < { [ ] } > } > ) ) > } ] ] ) )>>>"
