    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and identify the types and order of the brackets used. The input sequence is:\n\n( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > }\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with an opening parenthesis `(`.\n   - This is followed by three opening square brackets `[ [ [`.\n   - Then, there is an opening curly brace `{`.\n\n2. **Identify the closing brackets:**\n   - The first closing bracket is a curly brace `}` which matches the last opened curly brace `{`.\n   - This is followed by two closing square brackets `] ]` which match the last two opened square brackets `[ [`.\n   - Next, there is an opening curly brace `{`.\n\n3. **Continue with the sequence:**\n   - Inside this curly brace, there is an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - This is followed by an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - Then, there is another opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - Inside this, there is an opening square bracket `[`.\n   - Inside this, there is an opening curly brace `{` followed by a closing curly brace `}`.\n   - The sequence then closes the square bracket `]` and the angle bracket `>`.\n   - This is followed by a closing square bracket `]` and a closing angle bracket `>`.\n\n4. **Identify the remaining open brackets:**\n   - After processing the sequence, we have the following open brackets that need to be closed:\n     - One opening square bracket `[`.\n     - One opening parenthesis `(`.\n\n5. **Close the remaining open brackets:**\n   - Close the remaining square bracket with `]`.\n   - Close the remaining parenthesis with `)`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n\n( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > } ] )\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>> ( [ [ [ { } ] ] { < [ < [ { } ] > ] > } ] ) <<<answer>>>"
