    "To complete the sequence while ensuring that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order of closing brackets. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Brackets:**\n   - The sequence contains different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`.\n\n2. **Track the Order of Opening Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `<`, followed by `{`, then `(`, and another `{`.\n   - The sequence then has a closing `}` which matches the last opened `{`.\n   - Next, there is a closing `)` which matches the last opened `(`.\n   - After that, there is a `<` and a `>` which are already matched.\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Unmatched Opening Brackets:**\n   - After processing the sequence, we have the following unmatched opening brackets: `<` and `{`.\n\n4. **Close the Remaining Brackets in Reverse Order:**\n   - According to the stack principle (Last In, First Out), we need to close the brackets in the reverse order of their opening.\n   - The last unmatched opening bracket is `{`, so we close it with `}`.\n   - The next unmatched opening bracket is `<`, so we close it with `>`.\n\n5. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence should have all brackets properly closed in the correct order.\n\nBy following these steps, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<<< { ( { } ) < > } >>>"
