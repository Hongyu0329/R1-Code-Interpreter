    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct order of closing each type of bracket. The input sequence is: `{ < [ ]`.\n\nLet's break down the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets:**\n   - `{` is an opening curly brace.\n   - `<` is an opening angle bracket.\n   - `[` is an opening square bracket.\n   - `]` is a closing square bracket.\n\n2. **Determine the order of closing:**\n   - The sequence starts with `{`, which means it should be closed with `}`.\n   - Next, `<` is opened, which should be closed with `>`.\n   - Then, `[` is opened and immediately closed with `]`.\n\n3. **Sequence after closing the square bracket:**\n   - After closing the square bracket, the sequence is `{ < > }`.\n\n4. **Close the remaining brackets:**\n   - The angle bracket `<` should be closed with `>`.\n   - Finally, the curly brace `{` should be closed with `}`.\n\n5. **Final sequence:**\n   - The complete sequence with all brackets properly closed is `{ < [ ] > }`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ < [ ] > }>>>"
