    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and identify which brackets are open and need to be closed. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Open Brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `< < { ( < ( ) > ) }`.\n   - We need to track the opening of each type of bracket and ensure they are closed in the correct order.\n\n2. **Track the Sequence:**\n   - `<`: Open angle bracket.\n   - `<`: Open another angle bracket.\n   - `{`: Open curly brace.\n   - `(`: Open parenthesis.\n   - `<`: Open another angle bracket.\n   - `(`: Open another parenthesis.\n   - `)`: Close the most recent open parenthesis.\n   - `>`: Close the most recent open angle bracket.\n   - `)`: Close the most recent open parenthesis.\n   - `}`: Close the most recent open curly brace.\n\n3. **Remaining Open Brackets:**\n   - After closing the curly brace, we still have two open angle brackets `< <`.\n\n4. **Close the Remaining Brackets:**\n   - We need to close the two remaining open angle brackets in the reverse order of their opening.\n   - `>`: Close the second angle bracket.\n   - `>`: Close the first angle bracket.\n\n### Final Sequence:\n- The complete sequence with all brackets properly closed is: `< < { ( < ( ) > ) } > >`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The sequence is now balanced with all brackets closed in the correct order.\n\n<<< < < { ( < ( ) > ) } > > >>>"
