    "To solve the problem of completing the sequence while ensuring that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and determine the appropriate closing characters.\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Characters:**\n   - The sequence contains three types of brackets: curly braces `{}`, angle brackets `<>`, and parentheses `()`.\n   - The sequence starts with an opening curly brace `{`.\n   - Next, there is a closing curly brace `}`.\n   - Then, there is an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - This is followed by another opening curly brace `{`.\n   - Next, there is a closing curly brace `}`.\n   - Then, there is an opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - This is followed by a closing angle bracket `>`.\n   - Finally, there is an opening parenthesis `(`.\n\n2. **Determine the Unmatched Opening Characters:**\n   - The sequence starts with `{` and is immediately closed with `}`. This pair is complete.\n   - The next unmatched opening character is `<`, which is not yet closed.\n   - After that, there is another `{` which is closed by `}`. This pair is complete.\n   - The next unmatched opening character is `<`, which is closed by `>`. This pair is complete.\n   - Finally, there is an unmatched opening parenthesis `(`.\n\n3. **Close the Unmatched Opening Characters:**\n   - The unmatched opening characters are `<` and `(`.\n   - To close these, we need to add the corresponding closing characters: `>` for `<` and `)` for `(`.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - The original sequence is `{ } < { } < > (`.\n   - To complete the sequence, we add the closing characters `>` and `)`.\n\n5. **Final Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence is `{ } < { } < > ( > )`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ } < { } < > ( > )>>>"
