    "To solve the problem of completing the sequence while ensuring that the parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and understand the pattern and rules governing it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   - The input sequence is: `[ < > ] [ [ < > ]`\n   - It consists of square brackets `[]` and angle brackets `<>`.\n\n2. **Check for Proper Closure:**\n   - In the sequence `[ < > ]`, the angle brackets `< >` are properly closed within the square brackets `[ ]`.\n   - In the sequence `[ [ < > ]`, the angle brackets `< >` are properly closed, but there is an extra opening square bracket `[` that needs to be closed.\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence seems to involve nested structures where angle brackets are nested within square brackets.\n   - The first part `[ < > ]` is a complete and closed structure.\n   - The second part `[ [ < > ]` starts with an opening square bracket `[`, followed by another complete structure `[ < > ]`.\n\n4. **Complete the Sequence:**\n   - Since the second part starts with an extra `[`, it needs a corresponding closing `]` to ensure all brackets are properly closed.\n   - Therefore, the sequence should be completed by adding a closing square bracket `]` at the end.\n\n5. **Verify the Completion:**\n   - The completed sequence should be: `[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]`\n   - This ensures that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, maintaining proper closure.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe completed sequence with properly closed parentheses is:\n\n<<<[ < > ] [ [ < > ] ]>>>"
