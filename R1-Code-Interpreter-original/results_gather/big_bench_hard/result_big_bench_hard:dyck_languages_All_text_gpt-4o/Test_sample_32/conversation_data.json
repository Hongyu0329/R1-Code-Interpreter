    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The sequence contains different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, angle brackets `< >`, parentheses `( )`, and curly braces `{ }`. We need to match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket, ensuring that the order of closing matches the order of opening.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ]`\n\n2. **Identify the Opening Brackets**:\n   - The sequence starts with `[`, which is a square bracket.\n   - Next is `<`, an angle bracket.\n   - Then `[`, another square bracket.\n   - Followed by `(`, a parenthesis.\n   - Then `[`, another square bracket.\n   - Next is `<`, an angle bracket.\n\n3. **Identify the Closing Brackets**:\n   - The first closing bracket is `>`, which matches the last opened `<`.\n   - Next is `]`, which matches the last opened `[`.\n   - Then `{` is opened, followed by `<`.\n   - The next closing bracket is `>`, which matches the last opened `<`.\n   - Then `}`, which matches the last opened `{`.\n   - Next is `[`, which is opened, followed by another `[`.\n   - The next closing bracket is `]`, which matches the last opened `[`.\n   - Then `]`, which matches the last opened `[`.\n   - Next is `)`, which matches the last opened `(`.\n\n4. **Remaining Open Brackets**:\n   - After closing the parenthesis `)`, we have the following open brackets left: `[ < [`.\n   - The sequence ends with `]`, which matches the last opened `[`.\n   - Now, we have `[ <` remaining.\n\n5. **Complete the Sequence**:\n   - The remaining open brackets are `[ <`.\n   - We need to close these in the reverse order of their opening.\n   - First, close the `<` with `>`.\n   - Then, close the `[` with `]`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ] > ]`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ < [ ( [ < > ] { < > } [ [ ] ] ) ] > ]>>>"
