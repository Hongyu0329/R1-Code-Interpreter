    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence step by step. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: square brackets `[ ]`, parentheses `( )`, and angle brackets `< >`. Our goal is to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `[`, which is an opening square bracket.\n   - Next, `<` is an opening angle bracket.\n   - Then, `(` is an opening parenthesis.\n   - Another `<` follows, which is another opening angle bracket.\n\n2. **Identify the closing brackets:**\n   - The first closing bracket is `>`, which closes the most recent opening angle bracket `<`.\n   - Next, `[ ]` is a pair of square brackets, which are already balanced.\n   - Then, `( )` is a pair of parentheses, which are also balanced.\n   - Finally, there is a `>`, which closes the next most recent opening angle bracket `<`.\n\n3. **Determine the remaining unclosed brackets:**\n   - After processing the sequence, we have the following unclosed opening brackets: `[`, `<`, and `(`.\n\n4. **Close the remaining unclosed brackets in reverse order:**\n   - The last unclosed opening bracket is `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n   - Next, the unclosed opening bracket is `<`, so we close it with `>`.\n   - Finally, the first unclosed opening bracket is `[`, so we close it with `]`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all brackets are properly closed in the correct order.\n\nThe completed sequence is: `[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > ) > ]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ < ( < < > [ ] ( ) > ) > ]>>>"
