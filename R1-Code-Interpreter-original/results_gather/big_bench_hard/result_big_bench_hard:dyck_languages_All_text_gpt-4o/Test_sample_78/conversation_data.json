    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. The sequence consists of different types of brackets: angle brackets `< >`, square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`. The task is to complete the sequence by closing all the opened brackets in the correct order.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `< [ { { [ { [ { ( ( ) ) } ] } ( < < ( < > ) > { } [ [ [ ( < { } > ) ] ] ] { } > ) ( { } ) { } ] }`\n\n2. **Identify Open and Close Pairs**:\n   - `< >` for angle brackets\n   - `[ ]` for square brackets\n   - `{ }` for curly braces\n   - `( )` for parentheses\n\n3. **Track Open Brackets**:\n   - Start with an empty stack to track open brackets.\n   - Traverse the sequence from left to right, pushing open brackets onto the stack and popping them when a matching close bracket is found.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n   - `)` is closed, matching the previous `(`.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n   - `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n   - `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n   - `]` is closed, matching the previous `[`.\n   - `]` is closed, matching the previous `[`.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `>` is closed, matching the last opened `<`.\n   - `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n   - `(` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `)` is closed, matching the last opened `(`.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n   - `}` is closed, matching the last opened `{`.\n   - `]` is closed, matching the last opened `[`.\n   - `<` is closed, matching the first opened `<`.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Ensure that the stack is empty, indicating all opened brackets have been properly closed.\n\nThe sequence is now complete and all brackets are properly closed.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
