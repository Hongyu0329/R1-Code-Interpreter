    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct closing sequence for each opening symbol. The input sequence is:\n\n{ ( < [ < > ]\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening symbols and their corresponding closing symbols:**\n   - `{` corresponds to `}`\n   - `(` corresponds to `)`\n   - `<` corresponds to `>`\n   - `[` corresponds to `]`\n\n2. **Analyze the sequence:**\n   - `{` is opened first, so it should be closed last.\n   - `(` is opened next, so it should be closed second to last.\n   - `<` is opened next, so it should be closed third to last.\n   - `[` is opened next, so it should be closed fourth to last.\n   - Another `<` is opened, and it is closed immediately with `>`.\n   - `]` is already closed in the sequence.\n\n3. **Determine the remaining closing symbols:**\n   - After the `]`, we need to close the `<` that was opened before the `[`.\n   - After closing the `<`, we need to close the `(`.\n   - Finally, we need to close the `{`.\n\n4. **Construct the closing sequence:**\n   - The sequence of closing symbols should be `>`, `)`, and `}`.\n\n5. **Combine the input with the closing sequence:**\n   - The complete sequence is: `{ ( < [ < > ] > ) }`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ ( < [ < > ] > ) }>>>"
