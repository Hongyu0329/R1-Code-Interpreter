    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the input step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening symbols**: The input sequence is `( < [ (`. This sequence contains four opening symbols: a parenthesis `(`, an angle bracket `<`, a square bracket `[`, and another parenthesis `(`.\n\n2. **Determine the closing order**: To close the sequence properly, we need to close the most recently opened symbol first, following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, similar to a stack data structure.\n\n3. **Closing the symbols**:\n   - The last opened symbol is `(`, so we need to close it first with `)`.\n   - The next symbol to close is `[`, so we close it with `]`.\n   - The next symbol to close is `<`, so we close it with `>`.\n   - Finally, the first opened symbol is `(`, so we close it with `)`.\n\n4. **Construct the complete sequence**: By adding the closing symbols in the correct order, we complete the sequence.\n\nThe complete sequence with properly closed parentheses is: `( < [ ( ) ] > )`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<( < [ ( ) ] > )>>>"
