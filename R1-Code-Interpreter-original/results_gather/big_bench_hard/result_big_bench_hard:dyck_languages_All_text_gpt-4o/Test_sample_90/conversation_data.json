    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening symbols have corresponding closing symbols in the correct order. The sequence uses the following types of symbols:\n\n- Curly braces: `{` and `}`\n- Angle brackets: `<` and `>`\n- Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n- Square brackets: `[` and `]`\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Opening Symbols:**\n   - `{` is opened first.\n   - `<` is opened next.\n   - `(` is opened next.\n   - `[` is opened next.\n   - Another `(` is opened.\n   - Another `(` is opened.\n   - `[` is opened.\n   - `<` is opened.\n   - `{` is opened.\n   - `(` is opened.\n\n2. **Closing Symbols:**\n   - `{` is closed with `}`.\n   - `(` is closed with `)`.\n   - `{` is closed with `}`.\n   - `<` is closed with `>`.\n   - `<` is closed with `>`.\n   - `<` is closed with `>`.\n   - `[` is closed with `]`.\n   - `(` is closed with `)`.\n   - `(` is closed with `)`.\n   - `[` is closed with `]`.\n   - `(` is closed with `)`.\n   - `<` is closed with `>`.\n\n3. **Remaining Open Symbols:**\n   - `{` is still open.\n   - `<` is still open.\n\n4. **Closing the Remaining Symbols:**\n   - The last opened symbol is `<`, so it should be closed first with `>`.\n   - The first opened symbol is `{`, so it should be closed last with `}`.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all symbols are properly closed in the correct order.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n`{ < ( [ ( ( [ < { ( { } ) } < < > > > ] ) ) ] ) > > }`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<{ < ( [ ( ( [ < { ( { } ) } < < > > > ] ) ) ] ) > > }>>>"
