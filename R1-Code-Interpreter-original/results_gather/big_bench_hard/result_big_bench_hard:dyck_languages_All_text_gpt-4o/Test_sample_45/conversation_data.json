    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input and determine the correct closing sequence. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Symbols:**\n   - The sequence consists of three types of symbols: angle brackets `< >`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`.\n   - Each opening symbol must have a corresponding closing symbol.\n\n2. **Count the Opening Symbols:**\n   - `<` is an opening angle bracket.\n   - `{` is an opening curly brace.\n   - Two `(` are opening parentheses.\n\n3. **Count the Closing Symbols:**\n   - There is one `)` which is a closing parenthesis.\n\n4. **Determine the Unmatched Opening Symbols:**\n   - We have one `<` that needs a `>`.\n   - We have one `{` that needs a `}`.\n   - We have two `(` but only one `)`, so we need one more `)`.\n\n5. **Construct the Closing Sequence:**\n   - To properly close all the opened symbols, we need to add the following in order:\n     - One `)` to close the second `(`.\n     - One `}` to close the `{`.\n     - One `>` to close the `<`.\n\n6. **Combine the Closing Sequence with the Input:**\n   - The input is `< { ( ( )`.\n   - The closing sequence is `) } >`.\n\n7. **Final Sequence:**\n   - Combine the input with the closing sequence to get the complete sequence: `< { ( ( ) ) } >`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < { ( ( ) ) } > >>>"
