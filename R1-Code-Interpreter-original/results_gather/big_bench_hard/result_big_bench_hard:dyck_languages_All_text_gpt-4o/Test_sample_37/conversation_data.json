    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed. Let's analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing symbols:**\n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Brackets: `[` and `]`\n   - Braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n2. **Count the opening symbols:**\n   - Brackets: 3 opening brackets `[`\n   - Angle brackets: 1 opening angle bracket `<`\n   - Braces: 2 opening braces `{`\n   - Parentheses: 2 opening parentheses `(`\n\n3. **Count the closing symbols:**\n   - Parentheses: 2 closing parentheses `)`\n   - Braces: 1 closing brace `}`\n   - Angle brackets: 1 closing angle bracket `>`\n\n4. **Determine the missing closing symbols:**\n   - Brackets: 3 opening brackets `[` and 1 closing bracket `]` are present, so 2 more closing brackets `]` are needed.\n   - Braces: 2 opening braces `{` and 1 closing brace `}` are present, so 1 more closing brace `}` is needed.\n   - Parentheses: 2 opening parentheses `(` and 2 closing parentheses `)` are present, so no additional closing parentheses are needed.\n   - Angle brackets: 1 opening angle bracket `<` and 1 closing angle bracket `>` are present, so no additional closing angle brackets are needed.\n\n5. **Construct the sequence to close all symbols:**\n   - The sequence starts with: `[ [ [ [ < { ( ) } ( ) > { ( ) } ] { ( ) }`\n   - We need to add 2 closing brackets `]` and 1 closing brace `}` to properly close all the symbols.\n\n6. **Final sequence:**\n   - Add the missing closing symbols to the end of the sequence: `] ] }`\n\nTherefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n<<<[ [ [ [ < { ( ) } ( ) > { ( ) } ] { ( ) } ] ] }>>>"
