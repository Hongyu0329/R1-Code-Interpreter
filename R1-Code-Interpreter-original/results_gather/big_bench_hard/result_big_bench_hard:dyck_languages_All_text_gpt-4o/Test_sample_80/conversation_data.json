    "To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all the parentheses, brackets, and braces are properly closed in the given sequence. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sequence**: `[ < [ { { < > [ ( ) ] ( ( ) ) } } ] > ] { { { ( < > )`\n\n2. **Identify Opening and Closing Pairs**:\n   - Parentheses: `(` and `)`\n   - Brackets: `[` and `]`\n   - Braces: `{` and `}`\n   - Angle Brackets: `<` and `>`\n\n3. **Analyze the Sequence**:\n   - Start with the outermost structure and work inward.\n   - The sequence starts with `[`, so it must end with `]`.\n   - Inside the first `[`, we have `<`, so it must end with `>`.\n   - Inside the `<`, we have `[`, so it must end with `]`.\n   - Inside this `[`, we have `{`, so it must end with `}`.\n   - Inside this `{`, we have another `{`, so it must end with `}`.\n   - Inside this `{`, we have `< > [ ( ) ] ( ( ) )`, which is already balanced.\n   - After closing the innermost `{`, we close the next `{`.\n   - After closing the second `{`, we close the `]`.\n   - After closing the `]`, we close the `>`.\n   - After closing the `>`, we close the `]`.\n\n4. **Remaining Sequence**: `{ { { ( < > )`\n   - The sequence starts with `{`, so it must end with `}`.\n   - Inside the first `{`, we have another `{`, so it must end with `}`.\n   - Inside this `{`, we have another `{`, so it must end with `}`.\n   - Inside this `{`, we have `( < > )`, which is already balanced.\n   - After closing the innermost `{`, we close the next `{`.\n   - After closing the second `{`, we close the third `{`.\n\n5. **Final Sequence**:\n   - The complete sequence with properly closed parentheses, brackets, and braces is:\n     `[ < [ { { < > [ ( ) ] ( ( ) ) } } ] > ] { { { ( < > ) } } }`\n\n6. **Output the Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer is the completed sequence with all pairs properly closed.\n\n<<<[ < [ { { < > [ ( ) ] ( ( ) ) } } ] > ] { { { ( < > ) } } }>>>"
