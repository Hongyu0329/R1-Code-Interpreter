    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence and identify the types of brackets used. The sequence includes curly braces `{}`, parentheses `()`, and angle brackets `<>`. \n\nLet's break down the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing brackets:**\n   - `{` is an opening curly brace.\n   - `{` is another opening curly brace.\n   - `}` is a closing curly brace.\n   - `(` is an opening parenthesis.\n   - `(` is another opening parenthesis.\n   - `<` is an opening angle bracket.\n   - `>` is a closing angle bracket.\n   - `)` is a closing parenthesis.\n\n2. **Check the balance of each type of bracket:**\n   - **Curly braces `{}`:**\n     - We have two opening curly braces `{` and one closing curly brace `}`. Therefore, we need one more closing curly brace `}` to balance them.\n   - **Parentheses `()`:**\n     - We have two opening parentheses `(` and one closing parenthesis `)`. Therefore, we need one more closing parenthesis `)` to balance them.\n   - **Angle brackets `<>`:**\n     - We have one opening angle bracket `<` and one closing angle bracket `>`. They are already balanced.\n\n3. **Determine the order of closing brackets:**\n   - The sequence of opening brackets is `{ { } ( ( < > )`.\n   - The last opened bracket that is not yet closed is the second `{`, so we need to close it first with `}`.\n   - Next, we need to close the second `(` with `)`.\n   - The sequence of closing brackets should be `} )`.\n\n4. **Construct the completed sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence should be `{ { } ( ( < > ) } )`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question is:\n\n<<<{ { } ( ( < > ) } )>>>"
