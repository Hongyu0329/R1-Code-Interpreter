    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given input step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Symbols:**\n   - The sequence consists of three types of symbols: angle brackets `< >`, curly braces `{ }`, and parentheses `( )`.\n   - Each opening symbol must have a corresponding closing symbol.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Sequence:**\n   - The input sequence is: `< { < > } { (`\n   - Let's break it down:\n     - `<`: This is an opening angle bracket.\n     - `{`: This is an opening curly brace.\n     - `<`: This is another opening angle bracket.\n     - `>`: This is a closing angle bracket, which matches the second symbol `<`.\n     - `}`: This is a closing curly brace, which matches the first symbol `{`.\n     - `{`: This is another opening curly brace.\n     - `(`: This is an opening parenthesis.\n\n3. **Determine the Unmatched Symbols:**\n   - After analyzing the sequence, we have the following unmatched opening symbols:\n     - One opening angle bracket `<` at the start.\n     - One opening curly brace `{` after the first closing curly brace.\n     - One opening parenthesis `(` at the end.\n\n4. **Close the Unmatched Symbols:**\n   - To properly close all the unmatched symbols, we need to add the corresponding closing symbols in the correct order:\n     - The last unmatched opening symbol is `(`, so we need to add `)`.\n     - The next unmatched opening symbol is `{`, so we need to add `}`.\n     - The first unmatched opening symbol is `<`, so we need to add `>`.\n\n5. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence, with all symbols properly closed, is: `< { < > } { ( ) } >`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < { < > } { ( ) } >>>"
