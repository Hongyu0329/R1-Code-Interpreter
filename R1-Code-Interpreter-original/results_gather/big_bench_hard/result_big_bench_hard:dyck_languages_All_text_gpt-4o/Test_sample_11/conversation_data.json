    "To complete the sequence and ensure that all parentheses are closed properly, we need to analyze the given sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Opening and Closing Symbols:**\n   - The sequence contains different types of symbols: square brackets `[ ]`, curly braces `{ }`, angle brackets `< >`, and parentheses `( )`.\n   - Each opening symbol must have a corresponding closing symbol.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Sequence:**\n   - The input sequence is: `[ { < ( ) > }`\n   - Let's break it down:\n     - `[`: This is an opening square bracket.\n     - `{`: This is an opening curly brace.\n     - `<`: This is an opening angle bracket.\n     - `(`: This is an opening parenthesis.\n     - `)`: This is a closing parenthesis. It matches the last opened parenthesis `(`.\n     - `>`: This is a closing angle bracket. It matches the last opened angle bracket `<`.\n     - `}`: This is a closing curly brace. It matches the last opened curly brace `{`.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Closing Symbol:**\n   - After processing the sequence, we are left with an unmatched opening square bracket `[`.\n   - To properly close the sequence, we need to add a closing square bracket `]` at the end.\n\n4. **Construct the Completed Sequence:**\n   - The completed sequence, with all symbols properly closed, is: `[ { < ( ) > } ]`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[ { < ( ) > } ]>>>"
