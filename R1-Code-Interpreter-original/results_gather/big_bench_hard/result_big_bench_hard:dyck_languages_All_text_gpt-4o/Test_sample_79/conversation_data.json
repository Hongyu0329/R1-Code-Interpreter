    "To complete the sequence, we need to ensure that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the opening brackets and their types:**\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `(` (parenthesis)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `(` (parenthesis)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n\n2. **Identify the closing brackets and their types:**\n   - `)` (parenthesis)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `>` (angle bracket)\n   - `]` (square bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `>` (angle bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `]` (square bracket)\n   - `>` (angle bracket)\n   - `]` (square bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `(` (parenthesis)\n   - `)` (parenthesis)\n   - `(` (parenthesis)\n   - `)` (parenthesis)\n   - `>` (angle bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `{` (curly brace)\n   - `}` (curly brace)\n   - `>` (angle bracket)\n   - `>` (angle bracket)\n   - `[` (square bracket)\n   - `<` (angle bracket)\n   - `>` (angle bracket)\n   - `]` (square bracket)\n\n3. **Match the opening and closing brackets:**\n   - The sequence starts with `<`, which should be closed at the end.\n   - The first `[` is closed by the last `]`.\n   - The first `(` is closed by the first `)`.\n   - The second `[` is closed by the second `]`.\n   - The second `(` is closed by the second `)`.\n   - The third `[` is closed by the third `]`.\n   - The first `<` is closed by the first `>`.\n   - The fourth `[` is closed by the fourth `]`.\n   - The second `<` is closed by the second `>`.\n   - The third `<` is closed by the third `>`.\n   - The fifth `[` is closed by the fifth `]`.\n   - The fourth `<` is closed by the fourth `>`.\n   - The fifth `<` is closed by the fifth `>`.\n   - The third `(` is closed by the third `)`.\n   - The fourth `(` is closed by the fourth `)`.\n   - The sixth `<` is closed by the sixth `>`.\n   - The first `{` is closed by the first `}`.\n   - The seventh `<` is closed by the seventh `>`.\n   - The eighth `<` is closed by the eighth `>`.\n   - The sixth `[` is closed by the sixth `]`.\n\n4. **Determine the missing closing brackets:**\n   - The sequence is missing the closing brackets for the initial `<` and the initial `[`.\n\n5. **Complete the sequence:**\n   - Add the missing closing brackets `]` and `>` at the end of the sequence to properly close the initial `[` and `<`.\n\nThe completed sequence is:\n```\n< [ ( [ ( ) [ < [ < > ] < > [ ] > ] < < ( ) ( ) > < { } > > [ < > ] ] >\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<< < [ ( [ ( ) [ < [ < > ] < > [ ] > ] < < ( ) ( ) > < { } > > [ < > ] ] > >>>"
