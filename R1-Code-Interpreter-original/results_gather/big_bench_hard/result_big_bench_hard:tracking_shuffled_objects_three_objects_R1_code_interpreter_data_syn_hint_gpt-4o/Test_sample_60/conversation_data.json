    "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the books as Alice, Bob, and Claire swap them.\n\n1. Initially:\n   - Alice has \"Lolita\"\n   - Bob has \"Catch-22\"\n   - Claire has \"The Great Gatsby\"\n\n2. First swap (Alice and Claire):\n   - Alice gives \"Lolita\" to Claire and receives \"The Great Gatsby\" from Claire.\n   - Now, Alice has \"The Great Gatsby\" and Claire has \"Lolita\".\n\n3. Second swap (Bob and Alice):\n   - Bob gives \"Catch-22\" to Alice and receives \"The Great Gatsby\" from Alice.\n   - Now, Bob has \"The Great Gatsby\" and Alice has \"Catch-22\".\n\n4. Third swap (Claire and Alice):\n   - Claire gives \"Lolita\" to Alice and receives \"Catch-22\" from Alice.\n   - Now, Claire has \"Catch-22\" and Alice has \"Lolita\".\n\nAt the end of these swaps, the distribution of books is:\n- Alice has \"Lolita\"\n- Bob has \"The Great Gatsby\"\n- Claire has \"Catch-22\"\n\nTherefore, at the end of the semester, Bob has \"The Great Gatsby\".\n\n<<<answer>>>"
