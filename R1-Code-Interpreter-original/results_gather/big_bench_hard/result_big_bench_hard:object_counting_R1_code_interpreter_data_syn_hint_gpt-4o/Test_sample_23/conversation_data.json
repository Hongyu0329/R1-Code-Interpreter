    "To determine how many vegetables you have, we need to identify which items from your list are classified as vegetables. Here's the list you provided:\n\n1. Yam\n2. Cauliflower\n3. Bed\n4. Two cabbages\n5. Garlic\n6. Oven\n7. Carrot\n8. Head of broccoli\n9. Potato\n10. Stalk of celery\n11. Lettuce head\n12. Toaster\n\nNow, let's identify the vegetables:\n\n- Yam: Although often considered a vegetable, yams are technically tubers. However, for culinary purposes, they are often grouped with vegetables.\n- Cauliflower: Vegetable\n- Bed: Not a vegetable\n- Two cabbages: Vegetables\n- Garlic: Vegetable\n- Oven: Not a vegetable\n- Carrot: Vegetable\n- Head of broccoli: Vegetable\n- Potato: Vegetable\n- Stalk of celery: Vegetable\n- Lettuce head: Vegetable\n- Toaster: Not a vegetable\n\nCounting the vegetables:\n\n1.
