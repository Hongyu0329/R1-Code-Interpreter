    "To determine the total number of animals, we need to count each type of animal and sum them up. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Bear: 1\n- Dog: 1\n- Cow: 1\n- Cat: 1\n- Pigs: 2\n- Donkey: 1\n- Fish: 1\n- Frog: 1\n- Goats: 2\n\nNow, we sum these numbers to find the total number of animals.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n1 (Bear) + 1 (Dog) + 1 (Cow) + 1 (Cat) + 2 (Pigs) + 1 (Donkey) + 1 (Fish) + 1 (Frog) + 2 (Goats) = 11\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 11 animals.\n\n<<<answer>>> 11"
