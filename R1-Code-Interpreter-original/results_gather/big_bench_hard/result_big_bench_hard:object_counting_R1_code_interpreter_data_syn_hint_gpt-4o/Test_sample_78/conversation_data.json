    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to count each type of fruit and then sum them up. Let's list the fruits and their quantities:\n\n- Nectarines: 3\n- Apple: 1\n- Plum: 1\n- Strawberry: 1\n- Grape: 1\n- Oranges: 3\n- Raspberry: 1\n- Blackberry: 1\n\nNow, we add these quantities together to find the total number of fruits.\n\nTotal number of fruits = 3 (nectarines) + 1 (apple) + 1 (plum) + 1 (strawberry) + 1 (grape) + 3 (oranges) + 1 (raspberry) + 1 (blackberry)\n\nLet's calculate this sum:\n\n3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits is 12.\n\n<<<answer>>> 12"
