    "To determine the number of fruits you have, we need to identify which items in your list are fruits. \n\nThe items you listed are:\n1. A nectarine\n2. Two toasters\n3. An orange\n4. Four peaches\n5. An apple\n6. A strawberry\n7. A plum\n\nFrom this list, the following are fruits:\n- Nectarine\n- Orange\n- Peaches\n- Apple\n- Strawberry\n- Plum\n\nThe toasters are not fruits, so we exclude them from the count.\n\nNow, let's count the fruits:\n- 1 nectarine\n- 1 orange\n- 4 peaches\n- 1 apple\n- 1 strawberry\n- 1 plum\n\nAdding these up gives us a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 fruits.\n\n<<<'9'>>>"
