    "To determine the total number of musical instruments, we need to add up the quantities of each type of instrument mentioned:\n\n1. Trombone: 1\n2. Violin: 1\n3. Clarinet: 1\n4. Accordion: 1\n5. Flutes: 4\n6. Trumpet: 1\n7. Drums: 2\n8. Piano: 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the total:\n\nTotal = 1 (Trombone) + 1 (Violin) + 1 (Clarinet) + 1 (Accordion) + 4 (Flutes) + 1 (Trumpet) + 2 (Drums) + 1 (Piano)\n\nWe can perform this calculation directly:\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 12 musical instruments.\n\n<<<answer>>> 12"
