    "To determine the total number of vegetables, we need to count each item listed. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Lettuce head: 1\n2. Cauliflower: 1\n3. Yam: 1\n4. Cabbages: 2\n5. Heads of broccoli: 4\n6. Potato: 1\n7. Garlic: 1\n8. Carrot: 1\n9. Stalk of celery: 1\n10. Onion: 1\n\nNow, we sum these quantities to find the total number of vegetables.\n\nTotal = 1 (lettuce) + 1 (cauliflower) + 1 (yam) + 2 (cabbages) + 4 (broccoli) + 1 (potato) + 1 (garlic) + 1 (carrot) + 1 (celery) + 1 (onion)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of vegetables\ntotal_vegetables = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\nprint(total_vegetables)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the total number of vegetables.",
