    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of objects listed. The objects mentioned are:\n\n1. Microwave\n2. Table\n3. Fridge\n4. Stove\n5. Oven\n6. Toaster\n7. Couch\n8. Four cars\n\nThe first seven items are individual objects, and the last item, \"four cars,\" indicates four separate objects. Therefore, we need to add these up:\n\n- 7 individual objects (microwave, table, fridge, stove, oven, toaster, couch)\n- 4 cars\n\nThe total number of objects is the sum of these two quantities.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nTotal objects = 7 (individual objects) + 4 (cars) = 11\n\nTherefore, you have 11 objects in total.\n\n<<<answer>>> 11"
