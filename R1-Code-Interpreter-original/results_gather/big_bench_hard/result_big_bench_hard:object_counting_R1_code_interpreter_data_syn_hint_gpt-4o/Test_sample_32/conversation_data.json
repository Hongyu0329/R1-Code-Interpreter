    "To solve this problem, we need to count the total number of objects listed. Let's break it down:\n\n- Couches: 2\n- Toaster: 1\n- Chairs: 2\n- Microwaves: 4\n- Table: 1\n- Lamp: 1\n\nNow, we sum up all these quantities to find the total number of objects.\n\nTotal objects = 2 (couches) + 1 (toaster) + 2 (chairs) + 4 (microwaves) + 1 (table) + 1 (lamp)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\nTotal objects = 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11\n\nTherefore, you have 11 objects in total.\n\n<<<answer>>> 11"
