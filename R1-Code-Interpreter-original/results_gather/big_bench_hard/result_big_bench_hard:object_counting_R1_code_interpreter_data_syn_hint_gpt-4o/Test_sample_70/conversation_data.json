    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to add up the quantities of each type of fruit mentioned. Let's list them and their respective counts:\n\n- Oranges: 4\n- Peach: 1\n- Plum: 1\n- Apples: 3\n- Grapes: 3\n- Raspberries: 2\n- Nectarine: 1\n- Strawberry: 1\n- Blackberry: 1\n- Banana: 1\n\nNow, we sum these numbers to find the total number of fruits.\n\n```python\n# List of fruit counts\nfruit_counts = [4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n# Calculate the total number of fruits\ntotal_fruits = sum(fruit_counts)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_fruits)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the total number of fruits.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the total number of fruits is 18, which is consistent with the sum of the individual fruit counts provided. The calculation is straightforward and does not require symbolic computing or complex algorithms, as it simply involves summing a list of integers.\n\nGiven that the task is to count the total number of fruits, and the code has correctly performed this operation, the final answer is ready.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
