    "To determine how many vegetables you have, we need to count each item listed:\n\n1. Garlic\n2. Cabbage\n3. Onion\n4. Head of broccoli\n5. Yam\n6. Two potatoes\n\nEach of these items is considered a vegetable. The two potatoes count as two separate vegetables. Therefore, we add them all up:\n\n- Garlic: 1\n- Cabbage: 1\n- Onion: 1\n- Head of broccoli: 1\n- Yam: 1\n- Potatoes: 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of vegetables:\n\n1 (Garlic) + 1 (Cabbage) + 1 (Onion) + 1 (Head of broccoli) + 1 (Yam) + 2 (Potatoes) = 7\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 7 vegetables.\n\n<<<answer>>>7"
