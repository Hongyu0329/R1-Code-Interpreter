    "To determine the total number of vegetables, we need to count each item listed. Let's categorize and count them:\n\n1. Yams: 3\n2. Lettuce head: 1\n3. Onion: 1\n4. Potato: 1\n5. Cabbage: 1\n6. Carrot: 1\n7. Heads of broccoli: 2\n8. Stalks of celery: 2\n\nNow, we sum up all these quantities to find the total number of vegetables:\n\nTotal vegetables = 3 (yams) + 1 (lettuce head) + 1 (onion) + 1 (potato) + 1 (cabbage) + 1 (carrot) + 2 (heads of broccoli) + 2 (stalks of celery)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\nTotal vegetables = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 12\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 12 vegetables.\n\n<<<answer>>>12"
