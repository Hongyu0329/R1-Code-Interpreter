    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to count each type of fruit and sum them up. Let's list the fruits and their quantities:\n\n- Blackberries: 3\n- Strawberries: 2\n- Apple: 1\n- Oranges: 3\n- Nectarine: 1\n- Grape: 1\n- Peach: 1\n- Banana: 1\n- Plum: 1\n\nNow, we will sum these quantities to find the total number of fruits.\n\n```python\n# Define the quantities of each type of fruit\nblackberries = 3\nstrawberries = 2\napple = 1\noranges = 3\nnectarine = 1\ngrape = 1\npeach = 1\nbanana = 1\nplum = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of fruits\ntotal_fruits = blackberries + strawberries + apple + oranges + nectarine + grape + peach + banana + plum\n\n# Print the total number of fruits\nprint(total_fruits)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the total number of fruits.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the total number of fruits is 14, which is consistent with the sum of the quantities of each type of fruit listed. The calculation is straightforward and does not require complex symbolic computing or efficient searching, as it involves simple arithmetic addition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question of how many fruits you have is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 14"
