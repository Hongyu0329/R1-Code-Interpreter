    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to count each type of fruit and then sum them up. Let's list the fruits and their quantities:\n\n- Nectarines: 3\n- Peach: 1\n- Apple: 1\n- Strawberry: 1\n- Raspberries: 3\n- Banana: 1\n- Plum: 1\n\nNow, we add these quantities together to find the total number of fruits.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total fruits} = 3 (\\text{nectarines}) + 1 (\\text{peach}) + 1 (\\text{apple}) + 1 (\\text{strawberry}) + 3 (\\text{raspberries}) + 1 (\\text{banana}) + 1 (\\text{plum})\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of fruits\nnectarines = 3\npeach = 1\napple = 1\nstrawberry = 1\nraspberries = 3\nbanana = 1\nplum = 1\n\ntotal_fruits = nectarines + peach + apple + strawberry + raspberries + banana + plum\nprint(total_fruits)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the total number of fruits.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the total number of fruits is 11, which matches our manual calculation. The task was straightforward and did not require complex symbolic computing or efficient searching, as it involved simple arithmetic addition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question of how many fruits you have is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 11"
