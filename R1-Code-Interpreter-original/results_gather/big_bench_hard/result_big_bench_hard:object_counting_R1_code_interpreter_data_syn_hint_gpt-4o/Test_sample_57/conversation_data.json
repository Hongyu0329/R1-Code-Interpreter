    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to add up the quantities of each type of fruit you have. Let's list them:\n\n- Nectarines: 4\n- Bananas: 3\n- Peach: 1\n- Strawberry: 1\n- Raspberry: 1\n- Plum: 1\n- Apple: 1\n- Orange: 1\n\nNow, we sum these numbers to find the total number of fruits:\n\n4 (nectarines) + 3 (bananas) + 1 (peach) + 1 (strawberry) + 1 (raspberry) + 1 (plum) + 1 (apple) + 1 (orange) = 13\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 13 fruits.\n\n<<<answer>>> 13 <<<answer>>>"
