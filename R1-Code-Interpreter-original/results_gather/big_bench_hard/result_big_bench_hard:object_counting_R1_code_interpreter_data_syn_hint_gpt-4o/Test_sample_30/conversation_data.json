    "To determine the total number of fruits, we need to count each type of fruit and then sum them up. Let's list the fruits and their quantities:\n\n- Orange: 1\n- Strawberries: 3\n- Apple: 1\n- Bananas: 3\n- Raspberries: 3\n- Peach: 1\n- Blackberry: 1\n- Grape: 1\n- Plum: 1\n- Nectarines: 2\n\nNow, we sum these quantities to find the total number of fruits.\n\n```python\n# List of quantities of each type of fruit\nfruit_quantities = [1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n# Calculate the total number of fruits\ntotal_fruits = sum(fruit_quantities)\n\n# Output the total number of fruits\nprint(total_fruits)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of fruits.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the total number of fruits is 17, which matches our expectations based on the list of fruits provided. The code correctly sums the quantities of each type of fruit to arrive at this total.\n\nSince the code execution was successful and the result is correct, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
