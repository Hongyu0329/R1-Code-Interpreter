    "To determine the total number of animals, we need to count each type of animal and sum them up. Let's list the animals and their quantities:\n\n- Chicken: 1\n- Frog: 1\n- Mouse: 1\n- Cat: 1\n- Pigs: 2\n- Rabbits: 2\n\nNow, we add these numbers together to find the total number of animals:\n\n1 (Chicken) + 1 (Frog) + 1 (Mouse) + 1 (Cat) + 2 (Pigs) + 2 (Rabbits) = 8\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 8 animals.\n\n<<<answer>>>8"
