    "To determine the total number of musical instruments, we need to add up the quantities of each type of instrument you have. Let's list them and their quantities:\n\n- Flute: 1\n- Trumpet: 1\n- Accordions: 3\n- Violins: 3\n- Drum: 1\n- Clarinets: 3\n- Trombone: 1\n\nNow, we sum these quantities:\n\n1 (Flute) + 1 (Trumpet) + 3 (Accordions) + 3 (Violins) + 1 (Drum) + 3 (Clarinets) + 1 (Trombone) = 13\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 13 musical instruments.\n\n<<<answer>>> 13"
