    "To determine the total number of animals, we need to add up the number of each type of animal you have. Let's list them out and count:\n\n- Mouse: 1\n- Pig: 1\n- Fish: 4\n- Donkey: 1\n- Rabbit: 1\n- Dog: 1\n- Goats: 3\n- Duck: 1\n- Chickens: 3\n\nNow, we sum these numbers:\n\n1 (Mouse) + 1 (Pig) + 4 (Fish) + 1 (Donkey) + 1 (Rabbit) + 1 (Dog) + 3 (Goats) + 1 (Duck) + 3 (Chickens) = 16\n\nTherefore, you have a total of 16 animals.\n\n<<<answer>>> 16"
