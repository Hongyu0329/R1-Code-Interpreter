  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: an orange book, a red book, a brown book, a blue book, a black book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is the leftmost. The red book is to the right of the blue book. The orange book is the second from the right. The gray book is the fourth from the left. The black book is the rightmost. The gray book is to the right of the red book.\nOptions:\n(A) The orange book is the third from the right\n(B) The red book is the third from the right\n(C) The brown book is the third from the right\n(D) The blue book is the third from the right\n(E) The black book is the third from the right\n(F) The gray book is the third from the right\n(G) The white book is the third from the right\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The white book is the leftmost.\n2. The red book is to the right of the blue book.\n3. The orange book is the second from the right.\n4. The gray book is the fourth from the left.\n5. The black book is the rightmost.\n6. The gray book is to the right of the red book.\n\nWe have seven positions to fill with the books: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n- Position 1: White book (from condition 1)\n- Position 7: Black book (from condition 5)\n- Position 6: Orange book (from condition 3)\n- Position 4: Gray book (from condition 4)\n\nNow, we need to place the red, blue, and brown books in the remaining positions (2, 3, 5) while satisfying the conditions that the red book is to the right of the blue book and the gray book is to the right of the red book.\n\nLet's use Python to determine the correct order of the books.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Fixed positions\npositions = ['White', None, None, 'Gray', None, 'Orange', 'Black']\n\n# Books to place\nbooks = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Brown']\n\n# Find the correct permutation\nfor perm in permutations(books):\n    # Place the books in the available positions\n    temp_positions = positions[:]\n    temp_positions[1] = perm[0]\n    temp_positions[2] = perm[1]\n    temp_positions[4] = perm[2]\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    if temp_positions.index('Red') > temp_positions.index('Blue') and temp_positions.index('Gray') > temp_positions.index('Red'):\n        print(temp_positions)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct order of the books.",
    "Based on the code output, the order of the books on the shelf is as follows:\n\n1. White\n2. Blue\n3. Red\n4. Gray\n5. Brown\n6. Orange\n7. Black\n\nNow, we need to determine which book is the third from the right. The third from the right corresponds to position 5 in the list, which is the \"Brown\" book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n<<<C) The brown book is the third from the right>>>"
