    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds according to the given conditions and determine which bird is the rightmost.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.\n2. The quail is to the right of the crow.\n3. The raven is to the left of the robin.\n4. The blue jay is the third from the right.\n5. The cardinal is the leftmost.\n6. The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's try to arrange the birds:\n\n- The cardinal is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.\n- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n- The blue jay is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be in position 5, 6, or 7.\n- The quail is to the right of the crow, so the crow cannot be in position 7.\n- The raven is to the left of the robin, so the raven must be in a position before the robin.\n\nLet's use these constraints to find the correct arrangement:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nbirds = ['cardinal', 'hummingbird', 'raven', 'robin', 'crow', 'quail', 'blue jay']\npositions = list(permutations(birds))\n\nfor pos in positions:\n    if (pos[0] == 'cardinal' and\n        pos[3] == 'hummingbird' and\n        pos[4] == 'blue jay' and\n        pos.index('hummingbird') < pos.index('crow') and\n        pos.index('crow') < pos.index('quail') and\n        pos.index('raven') < pos.index('robin')):\n        print(pos)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct arrangement of the birds.",
    "Based on the output of the code, the arrangement of the birds is as follows:\n\n1. Cardinal\n2. Raven\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Blue Jay\n6. Crow\n7. Quail\n\nFrom this arrangement, we can see that the quail is the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
