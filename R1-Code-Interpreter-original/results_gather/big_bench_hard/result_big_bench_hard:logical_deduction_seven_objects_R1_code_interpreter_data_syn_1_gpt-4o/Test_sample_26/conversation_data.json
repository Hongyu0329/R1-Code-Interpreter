    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The motorcycle is older than the tractor.\n2. The hatchback is older than the limousine.\n3. The hatchback is newer than the truck.\n4. The truck is newer than the tractor.\n5. The minivan is the second-newest.\n6. The sedan is the third-newest.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since the minivan is the second-newest and the sedan is the third-newest, there must be one vehicle newer than both. Let's denote the newest vehicle as \"X\".\n- The order of the three newest vehicles is: X, Minivan, Sedan.\n- The hatchback is older than the limousine, so the limousine cannot be the newest vehicle.\n- The hatchback is newer than the truck, so the truck cannot be the newest vehicle.\n- The motorcycle is older than the tractor, and the truck is newer than the tractor, so the tractor is not the newest vehicle.\n\nGiven these deductions, the only vehicle that can be the newest is the limousine. Therefore, the order of the newest vehicles is: Limousine, Minivan, Sedan.\n\nNow, let's determine the order of the older vehicles:\n\n- The motorcycle is older than the tractor.\n- The truck is newer than the tractor.\n- The hatchback is newer than the truck.\n\nThis gives us the order for the older vehicles: Motorcycle, Truck, Hatchback, Tractor.\n\nCombining both parts, the full order from oldest to newest is:\n\n1. Motorcycle\n2. Tractor\n3. Truck\n4. Hatchback\n5. Sedan\n6. Minivan\n7. Limousine\n\nNow, we need to determine which vehicle is the third-oldest. From the order above, the third-oldest vehicle is the Truck.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (F) The truck is the third-oldest.\n\n<<<F>>>"
