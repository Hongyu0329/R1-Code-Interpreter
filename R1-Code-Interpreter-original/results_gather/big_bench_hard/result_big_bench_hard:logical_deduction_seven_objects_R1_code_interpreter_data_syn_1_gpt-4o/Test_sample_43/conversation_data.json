    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The robin is to the left of the owl.\n2. The crow is the rightmost.\n3. The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.\n4. The owl is the third from the right.\n5. The blue jay is to the left of the robin.\n6. The raven is the second from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the birds in order:\n\n- Since the crow is the rightmost, it must be in the 7th position.\n- The owl is the third from the right, which means it is in the 5th position.\n- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, which means it is in the 4th position.\n- The raven is the second from the left, which means it is in the 2nd position.\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining positions:\n\n- The robin must be to the left of the owl, so it can be in the 3rd position.\n- The blue jay is to the left of the robin, so it must be in the 1st position.\n- The falcon is the only bird left, so it must be in the 6th position.\n\nThe final order of the birds is:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Raven\n3. Robin\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Owl\n6. Falcon\n7. Crow\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which one matches the rightmost position:\n\n(A) The blue jay is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(B) The falcon is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(C) The raven is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(D) The crow is the rightmost - Correct\n(E) The robin is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(F) The owl is the rightmost - Incorrect\n(G) The hummingbird is the rightmost - Incorrect\n\nThe correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
