    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the books according to the given conditions and then determine which book is second from the left.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The purple book is the leftmost.\n2. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n3. The green book is to the left of the orange book.\n4. The orange book is to the left of the gray book.\n5. The black book is the third from the left.\n6. The green book is the third from the right.\n\nWe will use these conditions to determine the order of the books.\n\n1. Since the purple book is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n2. The black book is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n3. The green book is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n4. The orange book is to the left of the gray book, so the orange book must be in position 4, and the gray book in position 6.\n5. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be in position 2, and the brown book in position 7.\n\nNow, let's verify the arrangement:\n\n- Position 1: Purple\n- Position 2: Yellow\n- Position 3: Black\n- Position 4: Orange\n- Position 5: Green\n- Position 6: Gray\n- Position 7: Brown\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Now, we can determine which book is second from the left.\n\nThe book in position 2 is the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The yellow book is the second from the left.\n\n<<<G>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
