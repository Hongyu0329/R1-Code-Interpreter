    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in the correct order based on the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to place each bird in the correct position:\n\n1. The blue jay is the leftmost.\n2. The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n3. The raven is the third from the right.\n4. The owl is the third from the left.\n5. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail.\n6. The robin is to the left of the cardinal.\n\nLet's start by placing the birds based on the constraints:\n\n- Since the blue jay is the leftmost, it is in position 1.\n- The cardinal is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.\n- The raven is third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n- The owl is third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n\nNow, we have the following positions filled:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. ?\n3. Owl\n4. Cardinal\n5. Raven\n6. ?\n7. ?\n\nNext, we need to place the hummingbird, quail, and robin:\n\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the quail, so the hummingbird must be in position 2 or 6, and the quail must be in position 6 or 7.\n- The robin is to the left of the cardinal, so the robin must be in position 2 or 6.\n\nLet's try placing the robin in position 2:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Owl\n4. Cardinal\n5. Raven\n6. ?\n7. ?\n\nNow, the hummingbird must be in position 6, and the quail must be in position 7:\n1. Blue Jay\n2. Robin\n3. Owl\n4. Cardinal\n5. Raven\n6. Hummingbird\n7. Quail\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints. Now, let's check the options to see which bird is second from the right:\n\n- The bird in position 6 (second from the right) is the hummingbird.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
