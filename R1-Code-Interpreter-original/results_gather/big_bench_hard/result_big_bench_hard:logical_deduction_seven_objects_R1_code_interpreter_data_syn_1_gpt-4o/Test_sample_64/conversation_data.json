  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ada, Amy, Rob, Mya, and Mel. Ada finished below Amy. Joe finished below Dan. Dan finished below Ada. Mel finished third-to-last. Amy finished third. Rob finished below Mya.\nOptions:\n(A) Joe finished last\n(B) Dan finished last\n(C) Ada finished last\n(D) Amy finished last\n(E) Rob finished last\n(F) Mya finished last\n(G) Mel finished last\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Ada finished below Amy.\n2. Joe finished below Dan.\n3. Dan finished below Ada.\n4. Mel finished third-to-last.\n5. Amy finished third.\n6. Rob finished below Mya.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- From constraint 5, Amy is in 3rd place.\n- From constraint 4, Mel is in 5th place (third-to-last).\n- From constraint 1, Ada must be below Amy, so Ada is in 4th place.\n- From constraint 3, Dan must be below Ada, so Dan is in 6th place.\n- From constraint 2, Joe must be below Dan, so Joe is in 7th place.\n- From constraint 6, Rob must be below Mya. Since the only remaining positions are 1st and 2nd, Mya must be in 1st place and Rob in 2nd place.\n\nNow, let's verify the order:\n1. Mya\n2. Rob\n3. Amy\n4. Ada\n5. Mel\n6. Dan\n7. Joe\n\nThis order satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, Joe finished last.\n\nThe correct answer is option (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
