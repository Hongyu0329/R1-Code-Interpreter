  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells seven fruits: plums, kiwis, cantaloupes, pears, watermelons, apples, and loquats. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes. The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes. The watermelons are the second-most expensive. The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis. The apples are more expensive than the loquats. The loquats are the third-cheapest. The plums are the cheapest.\nOptions:\n(A) The plums are the third-cheapest\n(B) The kiwis are the third-cheapest\n(C) The cantaloupes are the third-cheapest\n(D) The pears are the third-cheapest\n(E) The watermelons are the third-cheapest\n(F) The apples are the third-cheapest\n(G) The loquats are the third-cheapest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n2. Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n3. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n4. Loquats are less expensive than kiwis.\n5. Apples are more expensive than loquats.\n6. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n7. Plums are the cheapest.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since plums are the cheapest, they are in the first position.\n- Loquats are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive, so they are in the sixth position.\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats but less expensive than cantaloupes, so they must be in the fourth position.\n- Loquats are less expensive than kiwis, so kiwis cannot be in the third position.\n- Cantaloupes must be more expensive than apples but less expensive than watermelons, so they are in the fifth position.\n- Pears are the only fruit left, so they must be in the second position.\n\nLet's verify this order:\n\n1. Plums\n2. Pears\n3. Loquats\n4. Apples\n5. Cantaloupes\n6. Watermelons\n7. Kiwis\n\nNow, let's check the conditions:\n\n- Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes (6 > 5) - True\n- Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes (4 < 5) - True\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive (6) - True\n- Loquats are less expensive than kiwis (3 < 7) - True\n- Apples are more expensive than loquats (4 > 3) - True\n- Loquats are the third-cheapest (3) - True\n- Plums are the cheapest (1) - True\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<G>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
