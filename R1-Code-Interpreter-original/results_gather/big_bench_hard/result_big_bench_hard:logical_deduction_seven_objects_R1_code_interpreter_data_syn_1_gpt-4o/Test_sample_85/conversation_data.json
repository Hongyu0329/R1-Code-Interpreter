    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, given the constraints provided. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Plums are the cheapest.\n2. Watermelons are the third-most expensive.\n3. Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n4. Kiwis are the most expensive.\n5. Apples are less expensive than peaches.\n6. Loquats are the third-cheapest.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Plums are the cheapest, so they are in position 1.\n- Loquats are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- Watermelons are the third-most expensive, so they are in position 5.\n- Kiwis are the most expensive, so they are in position 7.\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining fruits: oranges, apples, and peaches, while respecting the constraints:\n\n- Apples are more expensive than oranges.\n- Apples are less expensive than peaches.\n\nLet's try to place them:\n\n- Since loquats are in position 3, oranges could be in position 2.\n- Apples, being more expensive than oranges, could be in position 4.\n- Peaches, being more expensive than apples, could be in position 6.\n\nThis gives us the following order:\n\n1. Plums\n2. Oranges\n3. Loquats\n4. Apples\n5. Watermelons\n6. Peaches\n7. Kiwis\n\nNow, we need to determine which fruit is the second-most expensive. According to our arrangement, peaches are in position 6, which is the second-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (G) The peaches are the second-most expensive.\n\n<<<G>>>"
