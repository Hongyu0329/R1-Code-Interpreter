    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given constraints and identify which book is the rightmost.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. The purple book is the leftmost.\n2. The black book is the third from the left.\n3. The green book is the third from the right.\n4. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n5. The green book is to the left of the orange book.\n6. The orange book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Since the purple book is the leftmost, it occupies the first position.\n- The black book is third from the left, so it occupies the third position.\n- The green book is third from the right, which means it occupies the fifth position (since there are seven books in total).\n- The orange book must be to the right of the green book, so it can be in the sixth or seventh position.\n- The gray book must be to the right of the orange book, so it must be in the seventh position if the orange book is in the sixth position.\n- The brown book is to the right of the yellow book, so the yellow book must be in the second position, and the brown book must be in the fourth position.\n\nLet's verify this arrangement:\n\n1. Purple (1st)\n2. Yellow (2nd)\n3. Black (3rd)\n4. Brown (4th)\n5. Green (5th)\n6. Orange (6th)\n7. Gray (7th)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- The purple book is the leftmost.\n- The black book is third from the left.\n- The green book is third from the right.\n- The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.\n- The green book is to the left of the orange book.\n- The orange book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nNow, we can see that the gray book is the rightmost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) The gray book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
