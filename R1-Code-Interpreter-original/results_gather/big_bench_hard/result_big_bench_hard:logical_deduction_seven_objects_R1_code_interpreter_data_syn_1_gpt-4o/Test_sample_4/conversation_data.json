    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The pears are the third-cheapest.\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n3. The pears are more expensive than the plums.\n4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n6. The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nFrom these clues, we can start arranging the fruits:\n\n- Since the peaches are the second-cheapest, they must be placed in the second position.\n- The pears are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.\n- The plums must be cheaper than the pears, so they are the cheapest and occupy the first position.\n- The kiwis are the second-most expensive, so they are in the sixth position.\n- The mangoes are the third-most expensive, so they are in the fifth position.\n- The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis, so they must be in the fourth position.\n- The only fruit left is the watermelons, which must be the most expensive and occupy the seventh position.\n\nThe order from cheapest to most expensive is:\n1. Plums\n2. Peaches\n3. Pears\n4. Oranges\n5. Mangoes\n6. Kiwis\n7. Watermelons\n\nNow, let's check the options to find which one matches the second-cheapest fruit:\n\n- (A) The kiwis are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n- (B) The plums are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, plums are the cheapest.\n- (C) The mangoes are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n- (D) The watermelons are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, watermelons are the most expensive.\n- (E) The pears are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, pears are the third-cheapest.\n- (F) The peaches are the second-cheapest: Correct, peaches are indeed the second-cheapest.\n- (G) The oranges are the second-cheapest: Incorrect, oranges are the fourth-cheapest.\n\nThe correct answer is option (F).\n\n<<<F>>>"
