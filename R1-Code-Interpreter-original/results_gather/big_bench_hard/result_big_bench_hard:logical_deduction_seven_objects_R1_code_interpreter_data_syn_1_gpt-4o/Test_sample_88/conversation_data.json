  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: an orange book, a red book, a green book, a white book, a purple book, a brown book, and a yellow book. The green book is to the left of the purple book. The white book is to the right of the orange book. The green book is to the right of the brown book. The yellow book is to the right of the white book.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to arrange the books accordingly:\n\n1. The green book is to the left of the purple book.\n2. The white book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The green book is to the right of the brown book.\n4. The yellow book is to the right of the white book.\n5. The red book is to the right of the yellow book.\n6. The brown book is to the right of the red book.\n\nWe need to find the order of the books and determine which book is the rightmost.\n\nLet's use Python to help us find the correct order of the books.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the books\nbooks = ['orange', 'red', 'green', 'white', 'purple', 'brown', 'yellow']\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef is_valid_order(order):\n    green_index = order.index('green')\n    purple_index = order.index('purple')\n    white_index = order.index('white')\n    orange_index = order.index('orange')\n    brown_index = order.index('brown')\n    yellow_index = order.index('yellow')\n    red_index = order.index('red')\n    \n    return (green_index < purple_index and\n            white_index > orange_index and\n            green_index > brown_index and\n            yellow_index > white_index and\n            red_index > yellow_index and\n            brown_index > red_index)\n\n# Find the valid order\nfor order in permutations(books):\n    if is_valid_order(order):\n        print(order)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct order of the books.",
    "Based on the output of the code, the order of the books from left to right is:\n\n1. Orange\n2. White\n3. Yellow\n4. Red\n5. Brown\n6. Green\n7. Purple\n\nThe rightmost book in this order is the purple book.\n\n<<<E>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
