    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n2. The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n3. The plums are more expensive than the mangoes.\n4. The plums are less expensive than the peaches.\n5. The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\n6. The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to deduce the order:\n\n- Since loquats are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.\n- Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, which means they are in position 4.\n- Plums are more expensive than mangoes, so they must be in position 5 or higher.\n- Plums are less expensive than peaches, so peaches must be in position 6 or 7.\n- Peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes, so cantaloupes must be in position 7.\n- Watermelons are more expensive than loquats, so they must be in position 3 or higher.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Cheapest: Apples (since loquats are second-cheapest)\n2. Second-cheapest: Loquats\n3. Third-cheapest: Watermelons (since they are more expensive than loquats)\n4. Fourth-most expensive: Mangoes\n5. Fifth: Plums (since they are more expensive than mangoes)\n6. Sixth: Peaches (since they are less expensive than cantaloupes)\n7. Seventh: Cantaloupes (most expensive)\n\nNow, let's check the options to see which fruit is the third-cheapest:\n\n- (A) Mangoes are the third-cheapest: No, they are fourth.\n- (B) Cantaloupes are the third-cheapest: No, they are seventh.\n- (C) Apples are the third-cheapest: No, they are first.\n- (D) Plums are the third-cheapest: No, they are fifth.\n- (E) Loquats are the third-cheapest: No, they are second.\n- (F) Watermelons are the third-cheapest: Yes, they are third.\n- (G) Peaches are the third-cheapest: No, they are sixth.\n\nThe correct answer is option (F).\n\n<<<F>>>"
