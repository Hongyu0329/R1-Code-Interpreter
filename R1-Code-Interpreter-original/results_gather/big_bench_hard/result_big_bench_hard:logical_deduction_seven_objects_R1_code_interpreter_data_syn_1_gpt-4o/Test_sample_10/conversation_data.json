    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Watermelons are the cheapest.\n2. Kiwis are the third-cheapest.\n3. Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\n4. Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n5. Peaches are more expensive than mangoes.\n6. Peaches are less expensive than plums.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n- Watermelons are the cheapest, so they are in position 1.\n- Kiwis are the third-cheapest, so they are in position 3.\n- Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive, so they are in position 6.\n- Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes, so they are in position 7.\n- Peaches are more expensive than mangoes, but less expensive than plums.\n\nLet's assume the following order based on the constraints:\n1. Watermelons\n2. Mangoes\n3. Kiwis\n4. Peaches\n5. Plums\n6. Cantaloupes\n7. Oranges\n\nNow, let's verify if this order satisfies all the conditions:\n- Watermelons are the cheapest (position 1).\n- Kiwis are the third-cheapest (position 3).\n- Cantaloupes are the second-most expensive (position 6).\n- Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes (position 7).\n- Peaches are more expensive than mangoes (position 4 > position 2).\n- Peaches are less expensive than plums (position 4 < position 5).\n\nThis order satisfies all the conditions. Now, we need to determine which fruit is the third-most expensive. In this order, the third-most expensive fruit is the peaches.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) The peaches are the third-most expensive.\n\n<<<C>>>"
