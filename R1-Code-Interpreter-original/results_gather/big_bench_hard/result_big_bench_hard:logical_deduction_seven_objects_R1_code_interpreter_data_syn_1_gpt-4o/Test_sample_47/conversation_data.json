    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. There are seven books: brown, green, black, orange, white, blue, and gray.\n2. The brown book is the rightmost.\n3. The black book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The gray book is the third from the left.\n5. The orange book is to the right of the gray book.\n6. The orange book is to the left of the green book.\n7. The blue book is the third from the right.\n\nLet's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- Since the gray book is the third from the left, the positions are: _ _ Gray _ _ _ _.\n- The blue book is the third from the right, so the positions are: _ _ Gray _ _ Blue _.\n- The brown book is the rightmost, so the positions are: _ _ Gray _ _ Blue Brown.\n- The orange book is to the right of the gray book and to the left of the green book, so the positions are: _ _ Gray Orange _ Blue Brown.\n- The green book is to the right of the orange book, so the positions are: _ _ Gray Orange Green Blue Brown.\n- The black book is to the right of the white book, so the positions are: White Black Gray Orange Green Blue Brown.\n\nNow, let's check which book is the second from the right:\n\n- The order is: White Black Gray Orange Green Blue Brown.\n- The second from the right is the Blue book.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (F) The blue book is the second from the right.\n\n<<<F>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
