    "To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in the correct order based on the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to place each bird in the correct position:\n\n1. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n2. The crow is to the right of the cardinal.\n3. The cardinal is the second from the right.\n4. The quail is the third from the right.\n5. The falcon is to the left of the robin.\n6. The owl is the second from the left.\n\nLet's start by placing the birds based on the constraints:\n\n- Since the cardinal is the second from the right, it must be in position 6.\n- The quail is the third from the right, so it must be in position 5.\n- The crow is to the right of the cardinal, so it must be in position 7.\n- The owl is the second from the left, so it must be in position 2.\n\nNow, we have the following partial arrangement:\n\n1. ?\n2. Owl\n3. ?\n4. ?\n5. Quail\n6. Cardinal\n7. Crow\n\nNext, we know:\n\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n- The falcon is to the left of the robin.\n\nLet's try to place the remaining birds (hummingbird, falcon, robin) in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4):\n\n- The hummingbird must be to the left of the falcon, so it can be in position 1 or 3.\n- The falcon must be to the left of the robin, so it can be in position 3 or 4.\n\nLet's try placing the hummingbird in position 1:\n\n1. Hummingbird\n2. Owl\n3. Falcon\n4. Robin\n5. Quail\n6. Cardinal\n7. Crow\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints:\n\n- The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.\n- The falcon is to the left of the robin.\n- The owl is the second from the left.\n- The quail is the third from the right.\n- The cardinal is the second from the right.\n- The crow is to the right of the cardinal.\n\nNow, let's check which bird is fourth from the left:\n\n1. Hummingbird\n2. Owl\n3. Falcon\n4. Robin\n\nThe robin is fourth from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) The robin is the fourth from the left.\n\n<<<A>>>"
