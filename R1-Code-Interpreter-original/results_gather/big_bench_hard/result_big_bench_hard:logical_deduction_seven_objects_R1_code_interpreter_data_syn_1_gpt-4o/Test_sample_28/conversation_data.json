  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a limousine, a convertible, a station wagon, a minivan, a bus, a tractor, and a truck. The minivan is the oldest. The truck is older than the station wagon. The truck is newer than the limousine. The bus is newer than the convertible. The bus is older than the tractor. The limousine is newer than the tractor.\nOptions:\n(A) The limousine is the second-oldest\n(B) The convertible is the second-oldest\n(C) The station wagon is the second-oldest\n(D) The minivan is the second-oldest\n(E) The bus is the second-oldest\n(F) The tractor is the second-oldest\n(G) The truck is the second-oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The minivan is the oldest.\n2. The truck is older than the station wagon.\n3. The truck is newer than the limousine.\n4. The bus is newer than the convertible.\n5. The bus is older than the tractor.\n6. The limousine is newer than the tractor.\n\nLet's use these conditions to determine the order:\n\n- Start with the minivan as the oldest.\n- The truck is older than the station wagon, so the station wagon cannot be second.\n- The truck is newer than the limousine, so the limousine is older than the truck.\n- The bus is newer than the convertible, so the convertible is older than the bus.\n- The bus is older than the tractor, so the tractor is newer than the bus.\n- The limousine is newer than the tractor, so the tractor is older than the limousine.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Minivan (oldest)\n2. Convertible (since the bus is newer than the convertible)\n3. Bus (since the bus is older than the tractor)\n4. Tractor (since the limousine is newer than the tractor)\n5. Limousine (since the truck is newer than the limousine)\n6. Truck (since the truck is older than the station wagon)\n7. Station Wagon (newest)\n\nNow, let's check which vehicle is the second-oldest:\n\n- The second vehicle in the order is the Convertible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
