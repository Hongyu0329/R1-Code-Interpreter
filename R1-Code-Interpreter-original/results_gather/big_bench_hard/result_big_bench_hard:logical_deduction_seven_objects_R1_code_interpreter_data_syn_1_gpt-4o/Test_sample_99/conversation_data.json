  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a motorcyle, a sedan, a station wagon, a tractor, a minivan, a bus, and a truck. The motorcyle is older than the minivan. The minivan is older than the tractor. The bus is newer than the truck. The station wagon is the third-newest. The sedan is older than the truck. The tractor is older than the sedan.\nOptions:\n(A) The motorcyle is the third-oldest\n(B) The sedan is the third-oldest\n(C) The station wagon is the third-oldest\n(D) The tractor is the third-oldest\n(E) The minivan is the third-oldest\n(F) The bus is the third-oldest\n(G) The truck is the third-oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The motorcycle is older than the minivan.\n2. The minivan is older than the tractor.\n3. The bus is newer than the truck.\n4. The station wagon is the third-newest.\n5. The sedan is older than the truck.\n6. The tractor is older than the sedan.\n\nWe need to find which vehicle is the third-oldest. Let's analyze the conditions:\n\n- From conditions 1 and 2, we have: Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor.\n- From condition 6, we have: Tractor > Sedan.\n- From condition 5, we have: Sedan > Truck.\n- From condition 3, we have: Bus > Truck.\n- Condition 4 states that the station wagon is the third-newest.\n\nLet's try to arrange these vehicles in order:\n\n1. Motorcycle\n2. Minivan\n3. Tractor\n4. Sedan\n5. Truck\n6. Bus\n7. Station Wagon\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- Motorcycle > Minivan > Tractor (satisfied)\n- Tractor > Sedan (satisfied)\n- Sedan > Truck (satisfied)\n- Bus > Truck (satisfied)\n- Station Wagon is the third-newest (satisfied)\n\nThe third-oldest vehicle in this order is the Tractor.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) The tractor is the third-oldest.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
