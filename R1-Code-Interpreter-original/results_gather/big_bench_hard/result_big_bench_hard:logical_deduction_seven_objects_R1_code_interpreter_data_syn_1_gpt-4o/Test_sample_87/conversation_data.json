  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a station wagon, a limousine, a truck, a minivan, a motorcyle, a hatchback, and a bus. The motorcyle is older than the truck. The station wagon is older than the hatchback. The motorcyle is newer than the hatchback. The bus is the second-newest. The minivan is the oldest. The limousine is older than the station wagon.\nOptions:\n(A) The station wagon is the oldest\n(B) The limousine is the oldest\n(C) The truck is the oldest\n(D) The minivan is the oldest\n(E) The motorcyle is the oldest\n(F) The hatchback is the oldest\n(G) The bus is the oldest\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The motorcycle is older than the truck.\n2. The station wagon is older than the hatchback.\n3. The motorcycle is newer than the hatchback.\n4. The bus is the second-newest.\n5. The minivan is the oldest.\n6. The limousine is older than the station wagon.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know the minivan is the oldest. This eliminates options (A), (B), (C), (E), (F), and (G) because they all suggest a different vehicle is the oldest.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on the remaining statements:\n\n- Since the minivan is the oldest, it is in the first position.\n- The bus is the second-newest, so it is in the sixth position.\n- The motorcycle is older than the truck, so the motorcycle comes before the truck.\n- The station wagon is older than the hatchback, so the station wagon comes before the hatchback.\n- The motorcycle is newer than the hatchback, so the hatchback comes before the motorcycle.\n- The limousine is older than the station wagon, so the limousine comes before the station wagon.\n\nLet's try to arrange them:\n\n1. Minivan (oldest)\n2. Limousine\n3. Station Wagon\n4. Hatchback\n5. Motorcycle\n6. Bus (second-newest)\n7. Truck (newest)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, the minivan is indeed the oldest.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
