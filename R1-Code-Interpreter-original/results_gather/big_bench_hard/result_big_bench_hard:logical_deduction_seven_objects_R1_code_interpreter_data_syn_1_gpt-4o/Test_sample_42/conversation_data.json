    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given statements. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. The loquats are less expensive than the oranges.\n2. The oranges are the third-most expensive.\n3. The apples are the cheapest.\n4. The kiwis are more expensive than the pears.\n5. The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons.\n6. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that apples are the cheapest. Therefore, option (E) is the correct answer. However, let's verify the order of the other fruits to ensure consistency:\n\n- Since apples are the cheapest, they are in the 7th position.\n- Oranges are the third-most expensive, so they are in the 3rd position.\n- Loquats are less expensive than oranges but more expensive than kiwis, so loquats cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position. They must be in the 4th or 5th position.\n- Kiwis are more expensive than pears, so kiwis cannot be in the 6th position. They must be in the 5th or 6th position.\n- Mangoes are more expensive than watermelons, so mangoes cannot be in the 6th position. They must be in the 1st or 2nd position.\n\nLet's use Python to determine the exact order of the fruits:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the fruits\nfruits = ['mangoes', 'kiwis', 'oranges', 'watermelons', 'apples', 'pears', 'loquats']\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef is_valid_order(order):\n    # Apples are the cheapest\n    if order.index('apples') != 6:\n        return False\n    # Oranges are the third-most expensive\n    if order.index('oranges') != 2:\n        return False\n    # Loquats are less expensive than oranges\n    if order.index('loquats') >= order.index('oranges'):\n        return False\n    # Kiwis are more expensive than pears\n    if order.index('kiwis') <= order.index('pears'):\n        return False\n    # Mangoes are more expensive than watermelons\n    if order.index('mangoes') <= order.index('watermelons'):\n        return False\n    # Loquats are more expensive than kiwis\n    if order.index('loquats') <= order.index('kiwis'):\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Find the valid order\nfor order in permutations(fruits):\n    if is_valid_order(order):\n        print(order)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the correct order of the fruits."
