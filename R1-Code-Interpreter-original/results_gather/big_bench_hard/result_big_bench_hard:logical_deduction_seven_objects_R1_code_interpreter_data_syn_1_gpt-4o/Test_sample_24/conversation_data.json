  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a cardinal, a blue jay, a robin, a falcon, a quail, a hummingbird, and a raven. The falcon is to the right of the quail. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird. The raven is to the left of the quail. The blue jay is the second from the left. The robin is the third from the left.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the birds on the branch based on the given constraints. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **The blue jay is the second from the left.**\n   - This means the blue jay is in position 2.\n\n2. **The robin is the third from the left.**\n   - This means the robin is in position 3.\n\n3. **The cardinal is the third from the right.**\n   - Since there are seven birds, the cardinal is in position 5.\n\n4. **The falcon is to the right of the quail.**\n   - This means the quail must be to the left of the falcon.\n\n5. **The raven is to the left of the quail.**\n   - This means the raven must be to the left of the quail.\n\n6. **The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.**\n   - This means the hummingbird must be to the left of the robin.\n\nNow, let's try to place the birds in order based on these constraints:\n\n- Position 1: The hummingbird must be here because it is to the left of the robin, which is in position 3.\n- Position 2: Blue jay (given).\n- Position 3: Robin (given).\n- Position 4: The raven must be here because it is to the left of the quail.\n- Position 5: Cardinal (given).\n- Position 6: The quail must be here because it is to the right of the raven and to the left of the falcon.\n- Position 7: Falcon (since it is to the right of the quail).\n\nThe order of the birds is: Hummingbird, Blue Jay, Robin, Raven, Cardinal, Quail, Falcon.\n\nNow, let's determine which bird is the rightmost:\n\n- The rightmost position (position 7) is occupied by the Falcon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
