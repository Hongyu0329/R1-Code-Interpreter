  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eve, Rob, Dan, Mel, Ana, Eli, and Ada. Ada finished above Rob. Eve finished below Rob. Mel finished above Eli. Ada finished below Dan. Ana finished third. Eli finished second.\nOptions:\n(A) Eve finished fourth\n(B) Rob finished fourth\n(C) Dan finished fourth\n(D) Mel finished fourth\n(E) Ana finished fourth\n(F) Eli finished fourth\n(G) Ada finished fourth\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Ada finished above Rob.\n2. Eve finished below Rob.\n3. Mel finished above Eli.\n4. Ada finished below Dan.\n5. Ana finished third.\n6. Eli finished second.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can start placing the golfers in order:\n\n- Eli is in 2nd place.\n- Ana is in 3rd place.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining golfers: Ada, Rob, Eve, Mel, and Dan.\n\n- Ada is above Rob and below Dan. This means Dan must be above Ada and Rob.\n- Eve is below Rob, so Eve must be below both Ada and Rob.\n- Mel is above Eli, so Mel must be in 1st place since Eli is 2nd.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Eli\n3. Ana\n4. ?\n5. ?\n6. ?\n7. ?\n\nWe need to place Dan, Ada, Rob, and Eve in the remaining positions:\n\n- Dan must be above Ada, so Dan is 4th.\n- Ada is above Rob, so Ada is 5th and Rob is 6th.\n- Eve is below Rob, so Eve is 7th.\n\nThe final order is:\n\n1. Mel\n2. Eli\n3. Ana\n4. Dan\n5. Ada\n6. Rob\n7. Eve\n\nNow, we can determine who finished fourth:\n\n- Dan finished fourth.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (C) Dan finished fourth.\n\n<<<C) Dan finished fourth>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
