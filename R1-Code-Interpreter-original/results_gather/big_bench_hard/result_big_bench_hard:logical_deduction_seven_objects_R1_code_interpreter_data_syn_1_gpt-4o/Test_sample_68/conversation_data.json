    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given constraints. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Pears are more expensive than oranges.\n2. Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n3. Peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n4. Apples are the third-cheapest.\n5. Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n6. Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nWe need to find out which fruit is the cheapest. Let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From (1) and (2), we know: Pears > Oranges > Cantaloupes.\n- From (3), we know: Peaches < Cantaloupes.\n- From (4), Apples are the third-cheapest, so there are two fruits cheaper than apples.\n- From (5), Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- From (6), Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nLet's try to arrange the fruits in order of increasing price:\n\n1. Cheapest: ?\n2. Second cheapest: ?\n3. Third cheapest: Apples\n4. Fourth cheapest: ?\n5. Fifth cheapest: Mangoes\n6. Sixth cheapest: Watermelons\n7. Most expensive: ?\n\nGiven that peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes, and cantaloupes are less expensive than oranges, we can deduce that peaches are the cheapest. Let's verify this by arranging the fruits:\n\n1. Peaches\n2. Cantaloupes\n3. Apples\n4. Oranges\n5. Mangoes\n6. Watermelons\n7. Pears\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:\n\n- Pears are more expensive than oranges.\n- Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.\n- Peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes.\n- Apples are the third-cheapest.\n- Watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n- Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.\n\nThus, the peaches are the cheapest.\n\n<<<F>>>"
