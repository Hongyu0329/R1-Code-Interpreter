    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the books based on the given conditions and identify which book is the rightmost. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The yellow book is the rightmost.\n2. The blue book is to the left of the orange book.\n3. The green book is to the right of the white book.\n4. The blue book is to the right of the green book.\n5. The black book is the fourth from the left.\n6. The brown book is the third from the right.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it must be in position 7.\n- The black book is fourth from the left, so it must be in position 4.\n- The brown book is third from the right, which means it is in position 5.\n- The blue book is to the left of the orange book, and the blue book is to the right of the green book. This means the order must be: green, blue, orange.\n- The green book is to the right of the white book.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. White book\n2. Green book\n3. Blue book\n4. Black book\n5. Brown book\n6. Orange book\n7. Yellow book\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The yellow book is the rightmost: Yes, it is in position 7.\n- The blue book is to the left of the orange book: Yes, blue is in position 3 and orange is in position 6.\n- The green book is to the right of the white book: Yes, green is in position 2 and white is in position 1.\n- The blue book is to the right of the green book: Yes, blue is in position 3 and green is in position 2.\n- The black book is the fourth from the left: Yes, black is in position 4.\n- The brown book is the third from the right: Yes, brown is in position 5.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the yellow book is the rightmost.\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
