  "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: a white book, a gray book, a yellow book, a purple book, a red book, a black book, and a green book. The black book is the second from the right. The red book is to the left of the green book. The red book is the second from the left. The gray book is the third from the right. The yellow book is the third from the left. The white book is the fourth from the left.\nOptions:\n(A) The white book is the leftmost\n(B) The gray book is the leftmost\n(C) The yellow book is the leftmost\n(D) The purple book is the leftmost\n(E) The red book is the leftmost\n(F) The black book is the leftmost\n(G) The green book is the leftmost\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given conditions and then identify which book is the leftmost.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The black book is the second from the right.\n2. The red book is to the left of the green book.\n3. The red book is the second from the left.\n4. The gray book is the third from the right.\n5. The yellow book is the third from the left.\n6. The white book is the fourth from the left.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start placing the books:\n\n- Since the red book is the second from the left, it occupies position 2.\n- The yellow book is the third from the left, so it occupies position 3.\n- The white book is the fourth from the left, so it occupies position 4.\n- The black book is the second from the right, which is position 6.\n- The gray book is the third from the right, which is position 5.\n- The green book must be to the right of the red book, and since positions 5 and 6 are occupied, it must be in position 7.\n- The only position left for the purple book is position 1.\n\nLet's write a Python script to confirm this arrangement:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the positions of the books\nbooks = [''] * 7\n\n# Place the books based on the given conditions\nbooks[1] = 'Red'    # Second from the left\nbooks[2] = 'Yellow' # Third from the left\nbooks[3] = 'White'  # Fourth from the left\nbooks[5] = 'Black'  # Second from the right\nbooks[4] = 'Gray'   # Third from the right\nbooks[6] = 'Green'  # Must be to the right of Red\n\n# The only position left for the Purple book is the first position\nbooks[0] = 'Purple'\n\n# Print the arrangement of books\nprint(books)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the arrangement of the books.",
    "Based on the code output, the arrangement of the books on the shelf is as follows:\n\n1. Purple\n2. Red\n3. Yellow\n4. White\n5. Gray\n6. Black\n7. Green\n\nFrom this arrangement, we can see that the leftmost book is the Purple book.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<<<D) The purple book is the leftmost>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
