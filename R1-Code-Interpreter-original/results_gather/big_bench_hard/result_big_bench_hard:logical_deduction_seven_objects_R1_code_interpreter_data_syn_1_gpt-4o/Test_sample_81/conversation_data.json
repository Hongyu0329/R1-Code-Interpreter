    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books based on the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The gray book is to the left of the purple book.\n2. The white book is to the right of the brown book.\n3. The black book is the third from the right.\n4. The purple book is to the left of the white book.\n5. The white book is the second from the right.\n6. The gray book is the third from the left.\n7. The brown book is to the right of the green book.\n\nLet's use these conditions to determine the order of the books:\n\n- From condition 5, the white book is the second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- From condition 3, the black book is the third from the right, so it is in position 5.\n- From condition 4, the purple book is to the left of the white book, so it must be in position 4 or earlier.\n- From condition 6, the gray book is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n- From condition 1, the gray book is to the left of the purple book, so the purple book cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the purple book must be in position 4.\n- From condition 2, the white book is to the right of the brown book, so the brown book must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- From condition 7, the brown book is to the right of the green book, so the green book must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nLet's try to place the books in order:\n\n1. Green book\n2. Brown book\n3. Gray book\n4. Purple book\n5. Black book\n6. White book\n7. Red book\n\nNow, let's verify the conditions:\n\n- The gray book is to the left of the purple book (condition 1): True\n- The white book is to the right of the brown book (condition 2): True\n- The black book is the third from the right (condition 3): True\n- The purple book is to the left of the white book (condition 4): True\n- The white book is the second from the right (condition 5): True\n- The gray book is the third from the left (condition 6): True\n- The brown book is to the right of the green book (condition 7): True\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with this arrangement. Now, let's determine which option is correct:\n\n- (A) The purple book is the third from the left: False\n- (B) The green book is the third from the left: False\n- (C) The white book is the third from the left: False\n- (D) The gray book is the third from the left: True\n- (E) The red book is the third from the left: False\n- (F) The black book is the third from the left: False\n- (G) The brown book is the third from the left: False\n\nThe correct answer is (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
