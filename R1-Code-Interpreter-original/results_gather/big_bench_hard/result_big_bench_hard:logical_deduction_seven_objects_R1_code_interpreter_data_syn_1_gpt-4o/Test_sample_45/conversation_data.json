    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the books on the shelf based on the given constraints. Let's break down the constraints and try to place the books accordingly:\n\n1. The black book is the second from the left.\n2. The white book is to the right of the orange book.\n3. The black book is to the right of the brown book.\n4. The yellow book is the third from the right.\n5. The purple book is the third from the left.\n6. The orange book is the second from the right.\n\nLet's start placing the books based on these constraints:\n\n- From constraint 6, the orange book is the second from the right, so it is in position 6.\n- From constraint 4, the yellow book is the third from the right, so it is in position 5.\n- From constraint 1, the black book is the second from the left, so it is in position 2.\n- From constraint 5, the purple book is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.\n- From constraint 3, the black book is to the right of the brown book, so the brown book must be in position 1.\n- From constraint 2, the white book is to the right of the orange book, so it must be in position 7.\n\nNow, we have the following positions filled:\n1. Brown\n2. Black\n3. Purple\n4. (empty)\n5. Yellow\n6. Orange\n7. White\n\nThe only book left is the blue book, which must be in position 4.\n\nNow, let's verify the order:\n1. Brown\n2. Black\n3. Purple\n4. Blue\n5. Yellow\n6. Orange\n7. White\n\nThis order satisfies all the given constraints. Now, we need to determine which book is the leftmost:\n\n- The leftmost book is in position 1, which is the brown book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
